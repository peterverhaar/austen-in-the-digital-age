      "“ Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! ”; “ That is what you have in your head , I know — and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . ”; “ Well , ”; “ And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , ”; “ and a very considerable one — that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . ”; ” “; ” rejoined Mr. Woodhouse , understanding but in part . “; ” “; ” “; that_,”—said Mr. Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Mr. Knightley . Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , “; ” “; ” cried she playfully . “; ” Emma only nodded , and smiled.—After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , “; ” Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;—and two basins only were ordered . After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , “; “ You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , ”; “ I have not heard one inquiry after them . ”; “ Oh ! the good Bateses — I am quite ashamed of myself — but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs. Bates — I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.—They are always so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they , sir ? ”; “ Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago . ”; “ How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy — except when it has been quite an influenza . ”; “ That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . ”; “ No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except — “; ” This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said — much praise and many comments — undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;—but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin . Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . Here was a dangerous opening . “; ” said Mr. Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma ’s ear expressed , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” cried Emma , “; “ I am happy you approved , ”; “ but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . ”; expressed—“I understand you well enough ; ”; “ Miss Fairfax is reserved . ”; “ You think her diffident . I do not see it . ”; “ Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained . ”; “ Mr. Elton going to be married ! ”; “ He will have every body ’s wishes for his happiness . ”; “ Who shall answer that question ? ”; “ My father would say ‘ yes , ’ Mr. Knightley ‘ no ; ’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . ”; “ As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , ”; “ nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . ”; “ You are silent , Miss Fairfax — but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ’s account — we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . ”; “ Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole ’s ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly — I would not have you out in a shower!—We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _ boiled _ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very!—I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!—Good morning to you . ”; “ This is too bad , ”; “ And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so disappointed . ”; “ We had better move on , Mr. Weston , ”; “ we are detaining the girls . ”; “ Well , well , I am ready;”—and; “ but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:”—though; “ Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”—was; “ My dear , dear anxious friend,”—said; “ always overcareful for every body ’s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . ”; “ ’ Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon . ”; “ You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , ”; “ were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Do n’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . ”; “ I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , ”; “ she is a very elegant young woman . ”; “ Yes , ”; “ If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , ”; “ I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her — no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . ”; “ My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . ”; “ Yes , oh ! yes”—he; “ I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him — but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . ”; “ And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? ”; “ Ill , very ill — that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most deplorable want of complexion . ”; “ Well , ”; “ there is no disputing about taste.—At least you admire her except her complexion . ”; “ I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , ”; “ as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . ”; “ Ever hear her ! ”; “ Proof indeed ! ”; amused.—“Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . ”; “ Poor comfort ! ”; “ One would rather have a stranger preferred than one ’s very particular friend — with a stranger it might not recur again — but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . ”; “ all young people would have their little whims . ”; “ I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.—It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.—No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . ”; “ This is coming as you should do , ”; “ like a gentleman.—I am quite glad to see you . ”; “ The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . ”; “ Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . ”; “ He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naïveté . ”; “ Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . ”; “ What is the matter ? ”; “ Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! ”; “ Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?—Mr . Knightley!—Mr . Knightley must not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh ! no , no , Henry must have Donwell . I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley ’s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . ”; “ Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . ”; “ I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax — and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!—Oh ! no , no;—every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing . ”; “ My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax — ”; “ If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! ’ And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ’s old petticoat . ‘ Not that it was such a very old petticoat either — for still it would last a great while — and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ’ ”; “ For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he takes in her — his anxiety about her health — his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me — this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody — though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ? I can not help suspecting him . I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . ”; “ I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . ”; “ Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . ”; “ There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner . ”; “ You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment — I believe nothing of the pianoforte — and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . ”; “ I often feel concern , ”; “ that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose . ”; she—“this pianoforte is very kindly given . ”; “ For my companion tells me , ”; “ that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now . ”; “ Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps — I may be equally in the way here . Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ? ”; “ I am here on no business of my own , ”; “ I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument . ”; “ Well — if you advise it.—But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone — what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . ”; “ I do not believe any such thing , ”; Emma.—“I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax ’s opinion last night . ”; “ Very well , I am much obliged to you . My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night . How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad to hear such a good account . Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh ! then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her — and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.—‘Aye , pray do , ’ said Mr. Frank Churchill , ‘ Miss Woodhouse ’s opinion of the instrument will be worth having . ’—But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh , ’ said he , ‘ wait half a minute , till I have finished my job;’—For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ’s spectacles.—The rivet came out , you know , this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had no use of her spectacles — could not put them on . And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress ’s spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always — I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present — and she really eats nothing — makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats — so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before — I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us . ”; “ very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , ”; “ What was I talking of ? ”; “ It is not fair , ”; “ mine was a random guess . Do not distress her . ”; “ Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? ”; “ No , no , ”; “ you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd — and a crowd in a little room ! ”; “ Oh ! ”; “ there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable . ”; “ Emma , ”; “ this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined . ”; “ You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , ”; “ She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . ”; “ Very well . If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh ! yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins ’s week ’s account ; much rather , I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not I , indeed — I never look at it — I do not know who does.—Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . ”; “ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment it would be ! I do look forward to it , I own , with _ very _ great pleasure . ”; “ But you will come again , ”; “ This will not be your only visit to Randalls . ”; “ Ah ! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ? ”; “ If I can come again , we are still to have our ball . My father depends on it . Do not forget your engagement . ”; “ As you do us such ample justice now , ”; “ And you must be off this very morning ? ”; “ Yes — I _ have _ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better . It was a right thing to do . I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ’s being absent . She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _ must _ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . It was better to pay my visit , then ”; “ I certainly must , ”; “ This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ’s being dull and insipid about the house ! — I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not — for a few weeks at least . Well ! evil to some is always good to others . I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will be happy . He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes . ”; words—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse ’s beautiful little friend . Pray make my excuses and adieus to her . ”; “ Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton ’s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ . You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.—Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you — and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . ”; “ I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important — and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due — or rather what would be kind by me . ”; “ You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life — Want gratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for you!—Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! ”; “ There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , ”; “ There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved — which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not — but I know how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet!—I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a hundred such — And for a wife — a sensible man ’s wife — it is invaluable . I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! ”; “ elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . ”; “ And the staircase — You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) . A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . ”; “ We can not suppose , ”; “ that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive . ”; “ But you , who are so extremely fond of it — there can be no danger , surely ? ”; “ But every thing of that kind , ”; “ will soon be in so regular a train — ”; “ Mrs. Weston ’s manners , ”; “ were always particularly good . Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . ”; “ And who do you think came in while we were there ? ”; “ Insufferable woman ! ”; “ Worse than I had supposed . Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley!—I could not have believed it . Knightley!—never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her _ caro _ _ sposo _ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs. Weston!—Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse . I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ? How angry and how diverted he would be ! Ah ! there I am — thinking of him directly . Always the first person to be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind ! ”; “ My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . ”; “ She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , ”; “ She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.—She is _ not _ to be with the _ Dixons _ . The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle . ”; “ Such attentions as Mrs. Elton ’s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton ’s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . ”; “ I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , ”; “ And yet , ”; on—“And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . ”; “ Well , ”; “ and you soon silenced Mr. Cole , I suppose ? ”; “ In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles — what she calls them ! How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? She calls you , Knightley — what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax ’s mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton ’s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau . ”; Knightley—“I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong — and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - control ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be — And I love an open temper . No — till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always — but with no thought beyond . ”; “ Well , Mrs. Weston , ”; “ what do you say now to Mr. Knightley ’s marrying Jane Fairfax ? ”; “ Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me . ”; “ I see how it is , ”; “ I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . ”; “ She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . ”; “ This is very true , ”; “ at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant — and it is very shameful.—Of the same age — and always knowing her — I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never like me now . I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . ”; again—“Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ’s hands I ever saw . ”; “ If we were in the other room , ”; “ if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . I have a note of his.—Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? ”; “ I rather hope to satisfy you both , ”; “ for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . ”; “ I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father — or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . ”; “ Difference ! No indeed I am not . ”; “ Upon my word , ”; “ you amuse me ! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing engagements of mine — what have they been ? Dining once with the Coles — and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I can not imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one — and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . ”; “ He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed — he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word — but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . ”; “ So unreasonably early ! ”; “ How do you like Mrs. Elton ? ”; “ Not at all . ”; “ Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good - natured , I declare . ”; “ I did , ”; “ And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without . An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl — infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton . I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . ”; “ I am ready , ”; “ whenever I am wanted . ”; “ With you , if you will ask me . ”; “ Brother and sister ! no , indeed . ”; “ Yes , ”; “ I hope I do . ”; “ My dearest Harriet ! ”; “ you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic — I knew nothing of that till this moment — but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!—Oh ! my sins , my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on — what else ? ”; “ And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . ”; “ And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! ”; “ Lord bless me ! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this . ”; “ This was really his , ”; Harriet.—“Do not you remember one morning?—no , I dare say you do not . But one morning — I forget exactly the day — but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _ that _ _ evening _ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . ”; “ I do remember it , ”; “ I perfectly remember it.—Talking about spruce - beer.—Oh ! yes — Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton ’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it.—Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ? I have an idea he was standing just here . ”; “ Ah ! I do not know . I can not recollect.—It is very odd , but I can not recollect.—Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now . ”; “ Well , go on . ”; “ Oh ! that ’s all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say — except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . ”; “ My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? ”; “ Yes , simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was — but had not resolution enough to part with them . ”; “ But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?—I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful . ”; “ And when , ”; “ will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? ”; “ Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so”—and; “ It is one that I shall never change , however . ”; “ I hope it does not proceed from — I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? ”; “ Nonsense ! for shame ! ”; “ No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . ”; “ Oh ! ”; “ it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . ”; “ Never , never ! ”; “ That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . I must order the carriage . The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already . ”; answered—“I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue — quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . ”; “ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!”—seemed; “ Such a home , indeed ! such an aunt ! ”; “ You will soon be cooler , if you sit still , ”; “ As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared — but such a point had been made of my coming ! You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . I met _ one _ as I came — Madness in such weather!—absolute madness ! ”; “ No — he should not eat . He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter . ”; “ I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet ’s sweet easy temper will not mind it . ”; “ Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . I was a kinder friend than you deserved . But you were humble . You begged hard to be commanded to come . ”; “ Not to my feelings . I am perfectly comfortable to - day . ”; “ Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command . You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again — and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . ”; “ Three o’clock yesterday ! That is your date . I thought I had seen you first in February . ”; “ Oh ! no , no”—cried; “ No , no , ”; “ it will not reckon low . A conundrum of Mr. Weston ’s shall clear him and his next neighbour . Come , sir , pray let me hear it . ”; “ What two letters!—express perfection ! I am sure I do not know . ”; ” Emma ’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr. Knightley.—It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from hers , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured . — He looked at her with a glow of regard . She was warmly gratified — and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.—He took her hand;—whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say — she might , perhaps , have rather offered it — but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips — when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.—Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive.—He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped.—The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . It spoke such perfect amity.—He left them immediately afterwards — gone in a moment . He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance . Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed — but it might have happened at a better time — and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.—They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found . It was a pity that she had not come back earlier ! In the hope of diverting her father ’s thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley ’s going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check,—interested , without disturbing him . He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ’s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr. Knightley ’s going to London had been an unexpected blow . “; ” “; ” cried Emma , standing still with terror.—“Good; ” — “; ” returned Mrs. Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover — “; ”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ’s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend ’s happiness on most insufficient grounds . Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.—“But; ” she added , “; ” She was extremely angry with herself . If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.—Her days of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . This discovery laid many smaller matters open . No doubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane ’s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison . She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet ’s mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.—She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston ’s parting words . “; “ Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . ”; “ Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! ”; “ Poor girl ! ”; “ She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? ”; “ Poor girl ! ”; “ She loves him then excessively , I suppose . It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . ”; “ I am afraid , ”; “ that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . ”; “ On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , ”; “ was that of making her _ unreasonable _ . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been — that had been — hard for him to bear . ‘ I did not make the allowances , ’ said she , ‘ which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits — his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ’ She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you — I could not thank you too much — for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . ”; “ If I did not know her to be happy now , ”; “ which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;—for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!—Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good — I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . ”; “ How is it possible ? ”; “ _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it — but—(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . ”; “ Mr. Knightley , ”; confused—“I am in a very extraordinary situation . I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I never have . ”; “ I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story , probably — a common case — and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding . Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr. Weston — he was continually here — I always found him very pleasant — and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last — my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions . Latterly , however — for some time , indeed — I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself — except that I was _ not _ blinded — that it was my good fortune — that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . ”; “ I have no doubt of their being happy together , ”; “ You speak as if you envied him . ”; “ And I do envy him , Emma . In one respect he is the object of my envy . ”; “ Oh ! then , do n’t speak it , do n’t speak it , ”; ” “; ” “; ” Now I say , my dear , in _ our _ case , for _ lady _ , read —— mum ! a word to the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits , an’t I ? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—_My _ representation , you see , has quite appeased her . ”; “ I mentioned no _ names _ , you will observe.—Oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . I managed it extremely well . ”; “ Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?—(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane . ) Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!”—And; “ Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.—It is impossible to say — Yes , indeed , I quite understand — dearest Jane ’s prospects — that is , I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little circle as you find us here.—Yes , indeed.—Charming young man!—that is — so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!”—And; “ Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk . ”; “ Have not you mistaken the day ? ”; “ I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.—Mr . Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday . ”; side.—“I do believe , ”; “ this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove . ”; “ But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children . ”; “ No , no , that ’s to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill - usage , ) which made it so much the worse . And then not to find him at home ! I assure you I am not at all pleased . And no apology left , no message for me . The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone . Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.—Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it ? ”; “ It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent . ”; composure—“there would have been no danger . The danger would have been of my wearying you . You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest—. Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to — I have not time for half that I could wish to say . I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . I feel it so very due . But , unfortunately — in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend — ”; “ Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , ”; “ You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even — ”; “ You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know that I must have disgusted you . ”; “ Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side . Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there . I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ? ”; “ Very . ”; “ And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you — just as I begin to know you . ”; “ Oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . ”; “ Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , ”; smiling—“but , excuse me , it must be thought of . ”; “ Thank you , thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh ! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!—Good - bye , good - bye . ”; “ She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , ”; “ Poor child ! ”; “ at that rate , what will become of her ? ”; “ Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . I , who am owing all my happiness to _ you _ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ? ”; “ But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . ”; “ Do you?—I have no doubt . Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor gave you principles . You must have done well . My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . I do not believe I did you any good . The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . ”; “ I am sure you were of use to me , ”; “ I was very often influenced rightly by you — oftener than I would own at the time . I am very sure you did me good . And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . ”; “ How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks—‘Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ’s leave’—something which , you knew , I did not approve . In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . ”; “ What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . ”; “ ‘ Mr. Knightley . ’—You always called me , ‘ Mr. Knightley ; ’ and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal . I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what . ”; “ I remember once calling you ‘ George , ’ in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again . ”; “ And can not you call me ‘ George ’ now ? ”; “ He writes like a sensible man , ”; “ I honour his sincerity . It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . ”; “ Good or bad ? ”; “ I do not know which it ought to be called . ”; “ No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . ”; “ You are prepared for the worst , I see — and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . ”; “ No , this is impossible ! ”; “ You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . ”; “ You mistake me , you quite mistake me , ”; “ It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it . It seems an impossibility!—You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again — yet . You only mean , that he intends it . ”; “ Good God ! ”; ” He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad . Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , “; ” He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly — she did — cheerfully answering , “; ” replied Mr. Knightley ; “\n",

      "” “; ” CHAPTER II Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied . Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune — though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate — was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum . It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness . Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best . She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ’s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe . Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ’ marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved . The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ’s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease . Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . A complete change of life became desirable . He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought just employment enough . He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . He had , by that time , realised an easy competence — enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for — enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition . It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished . He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it . He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ’s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age . It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ’s assistance . His father had no apprehension of it . The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston ’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear . He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too . He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved . Now , upon his father ’s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place . There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates , or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit . Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion . For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received . “; ” Emma allowed her father to talk — but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions . Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last ! CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith ’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing . Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . In that respect Mrs. Weston ’s loss had been important . Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs. Weston ’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined . She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs . Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ’s being exactly the young friend she wanted — exactly the something which her home required . Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question . Two such could never be granted . Two such she did not want . It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing . Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell . She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain . Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked — but she could never believe that in the same situation _ she _ should not have discovered the truth . Harriet had no penetration . She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . Mrs. Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation — and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole . But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . Emma encouraged her talkativeness — amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin ’s having “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; book”—was all Harriet ’s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time . Her next beginning was , “; ” “; ” “; ” replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , “; ” he soon added , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” he replied . “; ” “; ” “; ” said Mrs. Weston gently , “; ” Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston ’s on the subject , as much as possible . There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma ’s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to “; ” “; ” “; ” said the gallant Mr. Elton — “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ’s picture . “; ” said she : “; ” Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naïveté , “; ” No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , “; ” “; ” cried Mr. Elton ; “; ” “; last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length—“my; ” The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December . But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was always on the alert . “; ” “; world,”—brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . “; ” thought Emma . “; ” cried Harriet . “; ” Emma was not sorry to be pressed . She read , and was surprized . The style of the letter was much above her expectation . There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a “; ” and was at last forced to add , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Harriet , looking down . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Harriet , contemplating the letter . For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , “; ” “; ” said Emma , smiling graciously , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; “; ” Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . The business was finished , and Harriet safe . She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton . “; ” was said in rather a sorrowful tone . “; ” Some time afterwards it was , “; ” Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin . “; ” “; ” “; ” Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger . CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night . For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard ’s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose . Mr. Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before . “; ” said he ; “; ” “; ” “; ” said he , “; ” “; ” “; ” Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing . He presently added , with a smile , “; ” Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton ’s having dropt a hint . Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him . “; ” he replied , “; ” said she , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Mr. Knightley presently , “; ” “; ” said he . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . “; ” said she , presently — her cheeks in a glow—“to; ” “; ” “; ” — — “; ” Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . “; ” said she . “; ” Harriet looked grave . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say . He looked rather doubtingly — rather confused ; said something about “; ” “; ” replied Mr. Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; “; ”—Harriet ’s was — “; ” said Emma , as they proceeded , “; ” Harriet , she found , had never in her life been inside the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr. Elton ’s seeing ready wit in her . “; ” said she ; “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again . “; ” stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within . “; ” said her companion . They walked on . The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr. Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther , “; ” Harriet could just answer , “; ” before the gentleman joined them . The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting . He had been going to call on them . His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them . “; ” thought Emma ; “; ” Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road . But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ’s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her . This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ’s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . Mr. Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them . Mr. Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ’s party at his friend Cole ’s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the celery , the beet - root , and all the dessert . “; ” was her consoling reflection ; “; ” They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more . She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort . “; ” said she , “; ” Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls . “; ” said John Knightley pleasantly , “; ” “; ” cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part . — “; ” “; ” “; ” she replied—“and; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and “; ” “; ” “; ” cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , “; ” “; ” cried Mr. John Knightley , hearing his own name . “; Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray; ” “; ” cried Emma , “; ” “; ” And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with , “; ” “; ” Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her ’s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “; ” Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard ’s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with — “; ” “; ” “; ” Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the “; ” which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips . They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr. Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly . Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her . She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , “; ” “; ” said she presently , “; ” His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . “; ” Emma smiled and answered—“My; ” “; ” said John Knightley , “; ” “; ” observed Mr. Elton . “; ” Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , “; ” CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston ’s drawing - room;—Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill - humour . Mr. Elton must smile less , and Mr. John Knightley more , to fit them for the place.—Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was . To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons . Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ’s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each . This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day ’s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton ’s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost . The misfortune of Harriet ’s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ’s coming , and of Emma ’s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma . Emma ’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of “; ” “; ” replied Emma ; “; ” “; ” Emma listened , and then coolly said , “; ” Emma saw Mrs. Weston ’s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : “; ” Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer . Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . “; ” Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away . As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage . Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tête - à - tête drive . It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . But now , she would rather it had not happened . She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston ’s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense . To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up — her hand seized — her attention demanded , and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping — fearing — adoring — ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . It really was so . Without scruple — without apology — without much apparent diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _ her _ lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all . Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , “; ” “; ” He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane — turning a corner which he could never bear to think of — and in strange hands — a mere common coachman — no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem — if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel — perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of all . Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken — more in error — more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself . “; ” said she , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” replied Mr. Knightley , rather displeased ; “; ” “; ” “; ” said Mr. Knightley warmly , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; “; ” “; ” Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . “; ”—She was stopped by a cough . Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . “; ” said he , gravely . She recovered her voice . “; ” He made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Emma was in no danger of forgetting . It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . Would not Harriet be the very creature described ? Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it . “; ” They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley . Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man ’s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _ her _ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again . While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr. Knightley by her side . He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , “; ” Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . “; ” said he , “; ” Miss Bates should never again — no , never ! If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . But it should be so no more . In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse . She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . She had no objection . She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not . “; ” She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule . There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking . She heard Miss Bates ’s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , “; ” Poor old Mrs. Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . “; ” Emma was most sincerely interested . Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude — sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax ’s advantage and comfort as possible . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going — her father began his inquiries . “; no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t; ” “; ” “; ” said he very seriously , “; ” Emma ’s courage returned , and she walked on . “; ” he continued , “; ”—And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room,—“I; ” ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up . ) “; ” Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , “; ” she continued , “; ” “; ” replied Mrs. Weston . “; ” “; ” “; ” At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , “; ” “; ” cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished . “; ” “; ” replied Emma , smiling ; “; ” “; ” “; ” She paused a few moments . Emma could not speak . “; ” replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully—“I; ” said he ; “; ” But that would not do . Mr. Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him . “; ” he replied ; “; ” He began — stopping , however , almost directly to say , “; ” he added shortly afterwards , “; ” When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud — all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus — “; sir,”—was then his remark . “; ” replied Mr. Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . “; ” “; ” “; ” The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma ’s answer was ready at the first word . “; “ For when a lady ’s in the case , “; ” “; ” “; ” Emma could not help laughing as she answered , “; ” cried Mr. Knightley . “; ” “; ” “; ” he replied , speaking very distinctly , “; ” replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , “; ” “; ” “; ” In half a minute they were in the room . Emma was extremely glad to see him — but there was a degree of confusion — a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure . When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation — or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , “; ” He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . “; ” he answered , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Emma . “; ” resumed he , “; ” Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , “; ” then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment—“I; ” He paused.—She coloured and laughed.—“I; ” “; ” replied Emma , archly ; “; ” “; ” But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying , “; ” “; ” He bowed . “; ” she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , “; ” The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ’s appearing not quite well . She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry . Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . “; ” he cried . “; ” Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , “\n",

      "“ My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean _ you _ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _ you _ . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know — in a joke — it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another . ”; “ Emma knows I never flatter her , ”; “ but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer . ”; pass—“you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day . ”; “ It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion , ”; “ We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ’s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ’s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . ”; “ Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches . ”; ” “; ” said Mr. Knightley , laughing , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said he , smiling . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” cried he ; “; ” said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , “; ” “; ” succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing — and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong . The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness . While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . “; ” said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children—“How; ” turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband . “; ” “; “ A very pleasant evening , ”; away;—“particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma . You left nothing undone . I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ’s , it must have been a real indulgence . ”; “ No , ”; “ you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore . ”; “ My dear Emma , ”; “ you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . ”; “ I am disappointed , ”; “ She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one ’s eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . ”; “ Emma , ”; “ I have a piece of news for you . You like news — and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . ”; “ News ! Oh ! yes , I always like news . What is it?—why do you smile so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls ? ”; “ No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , ”; “ Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse — I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . ”; “ There is my news:—I thought it would interest you , ”; “ How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . ”; “ Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . _ Now _ you have nothing to try for . You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than any body else . _ Now _ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . ”; “ Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , ”; replied;—“but you must often wish it , I am sure . ”; “ This present from the Campbells , ”; “ Yes , ”; embarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her notice of it . Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell . ”; “ That will do , ”; aloud—“you have sung quite enough for one evening — now be quiet . ”; “ One more;—they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more . ”; “ That fellow , ”; “ thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . This must not be . ”; “ How d ’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here . ”; “ How is your niece , Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold last night . How is she to - day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . ”; “ I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ? ”; “ Oh ! dear , Kingston — are you?—Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . ”; “ Mrs. Cole has servants to send . Can I do any thing for _ you _ ? ”; “ No , I thank you . But do come in . Who do you think is here?—Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in . ”; “ Well , ”; “ for five minutes , perhaps . ”; “ And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful ; so many friends ! ”; “ No , not now , I thank you . I could not stay two minutes . I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can . ”; “ Oh ! do come in . They will be so very happy to see you . ”; “ No , no ; your room is full enough . I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . ”; “ Well , I am so sorry!—Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . ”; “ Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England . Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it . ”; “ Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence — so shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples ! ”; “ What is the matter now ? ”; “ To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked ! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins mentioned it here . You should not have done it , indeed you should not . Ah ! he is off . He never can bear to be thanked . But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .... Well , ( returning to the room , ) I have not been able to succeed . Mr. Knightley can not stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing .... ”; “ Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ‘ Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ’ said he ; so I just mentioned .... Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?—You seem but just come — so very obliging of you . ”; “ You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! ”; “ You are right , Mrs. Weston , ”; “ Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . ”; “ Oh ! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand . Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . ”; “ That will never be , however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her — and I am very sure I shall never ask her . ”; “ You are not vain , Mr. Knightley . I will say that for you . ”; “ So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? ”; “ No indeed I have not . You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . ”; “ No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . ”; “ Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman — but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . ”; “ Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . ”; “ I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time . I hope you turned directly . ”; “ Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . ”; “ That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . ”; “ I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . ”; “ Indifferent ! Oh ! no — I never conceived you could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . ”; “ You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . ”; “ Ah ! you are not serious now . I know Mr. John Knightley too well — I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . ”; “ When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , ”; “ I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other . Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle — but that is not the change I had in view for you . As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . ”; “ thank you ”; “ The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . If you want any farther explanation , ”; “ they are paid for it . That is the key to a great deal of capacity . The public pays and must be served well . ”; “ I have heard it asserted , ”; “ that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike . I have not always known their writing apart . ”; “ I do not admire it , ”; “ It is too small — wants strength . It is like a woman ’s writing . ”; “ Oh ! when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , ”; “ writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best . ”; “ I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . ”; “ Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ’s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her ’s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . ”; “ And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again . ”; “ That is very likely . You think so , do not you ? ”; “ Increase ! ”; “ Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life . ”; “ There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!—When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr. Cole ’s , or balls at the Crown . The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great . ”; “ Very well — and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way . And if they are , I only beg you to send them home . ”; “ No , ”; “ that need not be the consequence . Let them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be at leisure . ”; “ They aimed at wounding more than Harriet , ”; “ Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? ”; “ _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.—To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet . ”; “ and they can not forgive me . ”; “ I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections . ”; “ Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ? ”; “ Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . ”; “ I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It was through a series of strange blunders ! ”; “ Whom are you going to dance with ? ”; “ Will you ? ”; “ Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . ”; “ Myself creating what I saw , ”; “ I did not know that proper names were allowed , ”; “ Pray , Emma , ”; “ may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . ”; “ The joke , ”; “ seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . ”; “ My dear Emma , ”; “ do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? ”; “ You had better explore to Donwell , ”; “ That may be done without horses . Come , and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast . ”; “ Oh ! I should like it of all things , ”; “ I can not name a day , ”; “ I hope you will bring Elton , ”; “ but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations . ”; “ These are my own concerns . I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin . ”—She; “ Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ? ”; could—“Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now . Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . ”; “ This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon . ”; ” “; ” “; “ He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . ”—She; “ Have I ? ”; “ of what nature ? ”; “ Oh ! the best nature in the world — a wedding . ”; “ If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . ”; “ I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . ”; “ Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent sense — your exertions for your father ’s sake — I know you will not allow yourself—. ”; “ The feelings of the warmest friendship — Indignation — Abominable scoundrel!”—And; “ He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for _ her _ . She deserves a better fate . ”; “ You are very kind — but you are mistaken — and I must set you right . — I am not in want of that sort of compassion . My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier . ”; “ Emma ! ”; “ are you , indeed?”—but; himself—“No , no , I understand you — forgive me — I am pleased that you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!—I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt — I could only be certain that there was a preference — and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?—Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . ”; “ He is a most fortunate man ! ”; “ So early in life — at three - and - twenty — a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman — the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ’s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,—equality of situation — I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one — and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment — and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used every body ill — and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a fortunate man indeed ! ”; “ You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.—You are wise — but _ I _ can not be wise . Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment . ”; “ Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself . ”; “ Thank you , ”; “ You are going in , I suppose ? ”; “ No,”—replied; spoke—“I should like to take another turn . Mr. Perry is not gone . ”; added—“I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation — as a friend , indeed , you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like . I will tell you exactly what I think . ”; continued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ’ Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . ”; “ That is , ”; “ she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . It will be the only difference . ”; “ John does not even mention your friend , ”; “ Here is his answer , if you like to see it . ”; “ John enters like a brother into my happiness , ”; “ but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . ”; “ My Emma , he means no such thing . He only means — ”; “ Emma , my dear Emma — ”; “ I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . ”; “ Oh ! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile . ”; “ I am afraid , ”; “ I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . ”; “ Indeed ! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too . ”; “ There is one subject , ”; “ I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . ”; “ Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet Smith . ”; “ Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? ”; “ You have , I believe , and know the whole . ”; “ It is so , indeed , ”; “ I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . ”; “ I mean that he has done it , ”; “ and been accepted . ”; cried.—“Well!”—Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , “\n",

      "” “; ” Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn . She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . She played and sang;—and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of . She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . There was merit in every drawing — in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . They were both in ecstasies . A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ’s performances must be capital . “; ” said Emma . “; ” Mr. Elton was only too happy . Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ’s sketch to wish to go on . There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both — a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton ’s very promising attachment was likely to add . Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . “; ” “; ” “; ” said Mr. Woodhouse . “; ” “; ” “; ” replied Emma rather slowly—“so; ” “; ” said the still waiting Harriet;—“well; ” Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : “; ” “; ” The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said — “; ” Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . “; ” she cried , looking aghast . “; ” “; ” “; ” Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; Woodhouse”—he stopt a moment—“or; ” The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . “; ” Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness . She could not speak . But she was not wanted to speak . It was enough for her to feel . Emma spoke for her . “; ” Mr. Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; mean!”—And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , “; ” How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet — never ! She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion . She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it . His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled . The picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the charade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet . To be sure , the charade , with its “; eyes”—in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth . Who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ? Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ’s friend . To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility . There was no denying that those brothers had penetration . She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr. Elton ’s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service . She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes . He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . There had been no real affection either in his language or manners . Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . She need not trouble herself to pity him . He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten . But — that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ) , to marry him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking . Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind . The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family — and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _ he _ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers . The first error and the worst lay at her door . It was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple . She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . “; “ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! ”; “ It might be distressing , for the moment , ”; “ but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over — and may never — can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . ”; “ very true , ”; “ would not think about it ; ”; “ of course it must be declined , ”; “ They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . ”; “ Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! ”; “ Do n’t class us together , Harriet . My playing is no more like her ’s , than a lamp is like sunshine . ”; “ Oh ! dear — I think you play the best of the two . I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . ”; “ Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax ’s is much beyond it . ”; “ Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . ”; “ Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . ”; “ Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it . And I hate Italian singing.—There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ? ”; “ Just as they always do — very vulgar . ”; “ They told me something , ”; “ but it is nothing of any consequence . ”; “ Oh ! ”; “ He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner . ”; “ They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox . I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer . ”; “ She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . ”; “ Very likely.—I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . ”; “ Aye , that will be much best , ”; “ I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard ’s . ”; “ I must not dwell upon it , ”; she.—“I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure . ”; “ it was very true — it was just as Miss Woodhouse described — it was not worth while to think about them — and she would not think about them any longer ”; “ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ”; “ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?—Is not she very charming ? ”; “ Oh ! yes — very — a very pleasing young woman . ”; “ I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . ”; “ Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . ”; “ I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . ”; “ Oh ! no — there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . ”; “ I dare say , ”; “ I dare say she was very much attached to him . ”; “ Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ’s fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . ”; “ Yes , ”; “ and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again . He is just as superior as ever;—but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ‘ Augusta . ’ How delightful ! ”; “ Miss Woodhouse — if you are at leisure — I have something that I should like to tell you — a sort of confession to make — and then , you know , it will be over . ”; “ It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , ”; “ to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary — I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . ”; “ How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! ... ”; “ Now , ”; “ you _ must _ recollect . ”; “ No , indeed I do not . ”; “ Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat — just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came — I think the very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?—But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it — so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . ”; “ Here , ”; “ here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . ”; “ I shall be happier to burn it , ”; “ It has a disagreeable look to me . I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . ”; “ I shall never marry . ”; “ Never marry!—This is a new resolution . ”; “ Mr. Elton indeed ! ”; indignantly.—“Oh ! no”—and; “ so superior to Mr. Elton ! ”; “ Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ? ”; “ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose — Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance — and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially . ”; “ I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet . The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . ”; “ Service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time — when I saw him coming — his noble look — and my wretchedness before . Such a change ! In one moment such a change ! From perfect misery to perfect happiness ! ”; “ It is very natural . It is natural , and it is honourable.—Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise . I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet . I do not by any means engage for its being returned . Consider what you are about . Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him . Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject . I am determined against all interference . Henceforward I know nothing of the matter . Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . But take care of yourself . I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _ him _ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value . ”; ” A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done . CHAPTER XI “; ” turning away distressed . “; ” cried Emma , after a moment ’s pause—“What; ” She could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer . Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma ’s . “; ” she began , “; ” “; ” cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely—“Let; ” “; “ Mr. Martin ! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it . ”; “ I never should have presumed to think of it at first , ”; “ but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine — and so I have . But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . ”; “ How d’ye do ’s ”; “ You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . ”; ” “; ” cried Emma , shaking her head.—“Ah; ” She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . She was not sorry . She wanted to be alone . Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational . Her father ’s business was to announce James ’s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing . The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet ’s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.—What had she to wish for ? Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . She must laugh at such a close ! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart — such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure in her returning — Every thing would be a pleasure . It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over . The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed . They arrived.—Mrs . Weston was alone in the drawing - room:—but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window . “\n",

      "” and “; ” Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete . “; ” continued Mr. Weston , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Mr. Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry . To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . VOLUME II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma ’s opinion , had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet ’s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—“Mr; “ But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . ”; “ Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? ”; “ You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly . ”; “ I have made a most wretched discovery , ”; “ I have been here a week to - morrow — half my time . I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!—I hate the recollection . ”; “ Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut . ”; “ No , ”; “ that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . ”; “ Thank you for rousing me , ”; “ I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way — so very odd a way — that I can not keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I?—Yes , I will — I declare I will — and you shall see how she takes it;—whether she colours . ”; “ I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . The strength of the song falls on the second . ”; “ Perhaps it is as well , ”; “ I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after yours . ”; “ And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , ”; “ to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield — if you are going home . ”; “ Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , ”; “ the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ’s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not you think so ? ”; “ We were too magnificent , ”; “ We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well . ”; “ It would be a crowd — a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? ”; “ Very true , ”; “ it was very bad . ”; “ I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . ”; “ There is no denying it , ”; “ I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room — Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite!—Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father — and altogether — I do not know that — I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . ”; “ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ”; “ your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father ’s little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a thought of my father ’s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? ”; “ The Crown ! ”; “ Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange?—You consent — I hope you consent ? ”; “ No ; he thought it very far from an improvement — a very bad plan — much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life — did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh ! no — a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . ”; “ I was going to observe , sir , ”; “ that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ’s catching cold — so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . ”; “ From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all — not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . ”; “ Open the windows!—but surely , Mr. Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent ! I never heard of such a thing . Dancing with open windows!—I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . ”; “ But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited — ”; “ So they will , my dear . That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired — but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight . ”; “ I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston ’s care . Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . ”; “ There , papa!—Now you must be satisfied — Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ‘ If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . ’ How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! ”; “ Aye , very true . Mr. Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ’s great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort — which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella ’s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . ”; “ My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , ”; “ examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . ”; “ Yes , very true , ”; “ very true . You want your neighbours ’ opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them — the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ? She is still nearer.—And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ? ”; “ I think she must be here soon , ”; “ I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her . It can not be long , I think , before she comes . ”; rain.—“I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , ”; “ Miss Bates must not be forgotten : ”; “ Jane!”—repeated; displeasure.—“That is easy — but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . ”; “ You are ungrateful . ”; “ Ungrateful!—What do you mean ? ”; smile—“No , do not tell me — I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is my father?—When are we to begin dancing ? ”; “ By the bye , ”; “ Miss Woodhouse , ”; “ have your nephews taken away their alphabets — their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ? This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again . ”; “ poor little boys , ”; “ I will give it to her — shall I?”—and; “ As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad , ”; “ I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places . You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at — or my tour to read — or my poem . I shall do something to expose myself . ”; “ You are sick of prosperity and indulgence . Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? ”; “ We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;—you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ? ”; “ No — It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross . ”; “ These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . I shall press you no more . ”; “ Well;—if _ you _ wish me to stay and join the party , I will . ”; “ How much I am obliged to you , ”; “ for telling me to come to - day!—If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . I had quite determined to go away again . ”; “ Do n’t say I was cross . I was fatigued . The heat overcame me . ”; “ It is hotter to - day . ”; “ You are comfortable because you are under command . ”; “ Your command?—Yes . ”; “ It comes to the same thing . I can have no self - command without a motive . You order me , whether you speak or not . And you can be always with me . You are always with me . ”; “ Dating from three o’clock yesterday . My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before . ”; “ Your gallantry is really unanswerable . But ( lowering her voice)—nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . ”; “ It will not do , ”; “ they are most of them affronted . I will attack them with more address . Ladies and gentlemen — I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated — or two things moderately clever — or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . ”; ”—Even Mr. Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , “; ” and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma . The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband — her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion — and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill ’s death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ’s side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ’s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness — and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . “; ” “; ” “; ” For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , “; ” They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well; ” “; ” She stopped to breathe . Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Emma , “\n",

      "“ My brother Mr. Suckling ’s seat;”—a; “ Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the likeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ’s favourite room . ”—Mr; to.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . ”; “ So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is not merely the house — the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way — just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . ”; “ When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties . ”; “ Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that . It is the garden of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England . ”; “ Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry . ”; “ No , I fancy not , ”; “ I never heard any county but Surry called so . ”; “ My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , ”; “ and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _ our _ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King’s - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ? ”; “ No ; not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . ”; “ Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ‘ I really can not get this girl to move from the house . I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . ’ Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father ’s state of health must be a great drawback . Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he should . Let me recommend Bath to you . I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . ”; “ My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . ”; “ Ah ! that ’s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse ’s spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . ”; “ but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . ”; “ I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady ’s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . ”; “ Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea . A superior performer!—very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music — passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely can not do without music . It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too — knowing what I had been accustomed to — of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ I could give up — parties , balls , plays — for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _ me _ . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ‘ But , ’ said I , ‘ to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . ’ ”; “ No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head . I am delighted to find myself in such a circle . I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ? If _ we _ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies . Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know — there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music . ”; “ I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music — never touches the instrument — though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys — Clara Partridge , that was — and of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate . Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . ”; “ Well , ”; “ we shall see . ”; “ We have been calling at Randalls , ”; “ and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . I like them extremely . Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature — quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you . And _ she _ appears so truly good — there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . She was your governess , I think ? ”; “ Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman . ”; “ Knightley ! ”; “ Knightley himself!—Was not it lucky?—for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. ’s , I had a great curiosity . ‘ My friend Knightley ’ had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much . Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man . ”; “ Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.—A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike — and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth — but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward . Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ‘ Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ‘ And waste its fragrance on the desert air . ’ We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax . ”; answer—“and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ’s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . ”; “ Oh ! but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end ! And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me . I am a great advocate for timidity — and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . ”; “ You appear to feel a great deal — but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax ’s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than ”; “ My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . You and I need not be afraid . If _ we _ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _ We _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it . I have no idea of that sort of thing . It is not likely that I _ should _ , considering what I have been used to . My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be — for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.—However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.—I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties . ”; “ Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought; Emma.—“You have not deserved this . You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax . ’ Heavens ! Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!—But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ’s tongue ! ”; “ dear Miss Woodhouse . ”; “ Oh ! she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again , ”; “ We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”—and; “ Something that would do ! ”; “ Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . ”; “ I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;—that is — I do not know — if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;—yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;—and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest . ”; “ And I am quite serious too , I assure you , ”; “ in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . ”; “ Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!—Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he is;—I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . Oh ! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it?—Selina ’s choice — handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed — quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ? ”; “ No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice — You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women — and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill ’s making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says it is quite horror to her — and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? ”; “ Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for ”; “ Oh ! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me . Selina is no fine lady , I assure you . Do not run away with such an idea . ”; “ Is not she ? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . ”; “ If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr. Weston?—To Bath , or to Clifton ? ”; “ She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her . The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . It is a retired place . A fine place , but very retired . ”; “ Frank was here in February for a fortnight . ”; “ So I remember to have heard . He will find an _ addition _ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world . ”; “ A very fine young man indeed , Mr. Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.—You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve — so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies — quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . ”; “ I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a pleasure it is to send one ’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of _ them _ . ”; “ So very obliging of you!—No rain at all . Nothing to signify . I do not care for myself . Quite thick shoes . And Jane declares — Well!—(as soon as she was within the door ) Well ! This is brilliant indeed!—This is admirable!—Excellently contrived , upon my word . Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane , Jane , look!—did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ’s lamp . Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ‘ Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ’ said I — but I had not time for more . ”; “ How do you like my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my hair?”—with; “ Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do — but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ’s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons — who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour — I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.—We shall see if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill . I like him very well . ”; “ Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?—I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . ”; “ Is not this most vexatious , Knightley ? ”; cried.—“And such weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious . What are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston . ”; “ You may depend upon me , ”; “ I certainly will come . Name your day , and I will come . You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? ”; “ till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you . ”; “ Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give me a carte - blanche.—I am Lady Patroness , you know . It is my party . I will bring friends with me . ”; “ Oh ! now you are looking very sly . But consider — you need not be afraid of delegating power to _ me _ . I am no young lady on her preferment . Married women , you know , may be safely authorised . It is my party . Leave it all to me . I will invite your guests . ”; “ No,”—he; replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is — ”; “ — Mrs. Weston , I suppose , ”; “ No — Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . ”; “ Ah ! you are an odd creature ! ”; herself.—“You are a humourist , and may say what you like . Quite a humourist . Well , I shall bring Jane with me — Jane and her aunt.—The rest I leave to you . I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family . Do n’t scruple . I know you are attached to them . ”; “ You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . ”; “ That ’s quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:—but as you like . It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade — a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;—and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors — a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ? ”; “ Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors . When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . ”; “ Well — as you please ; only do n’t have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything — ”; “ I have not the least wish for it , I thank you . ”; “ Well — but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . ”; “ I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ’s assistance . ”; “ I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me — and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;—and very long walks , you know — in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . ”; “ You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs. Cole ’s . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . ”; “ That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend . Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.—Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . ”; “ It is a sort of thing , ”; “ which _ I _ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the _ Chaperon _ of the party—_I _ never was in any circle — exploring parties — young ladies — married women — ”; “ Oh ! for myself , I protest I must be excused , ”; “ _ I _ really can not attempt — I am not at all fond of the sort of thing . I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with . I knew who it came from . An abominable puppy!—You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) . These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . Miss Woodhouse must excuse me . I am not one of those who have witty things at every body ’s service . I do not pretend to be a wit . I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . Pass us , if you please , Mr. Churchill . Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself . We have nothing clever to say — not one of us . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; “ Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you . ”; “ What ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will be a favour indeed ! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton ’s time is so engaged . ”; “ Upon my word it is , Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to night.—There is no end of people ’s coming to him , on some pretence or other.—The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion . They seem not able to do any thing without him.—‘Upon my word , Mr. E. , ’ I often say , ‘ rather you than I.—I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . ’—Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.—However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . ”; “ I can not imagine , ”; “ I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it . ”\n",

CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ’s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton ’s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ’s side , as there could be any occasion for . She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton ’s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . She had no scruple with regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ’s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” said Emma . “; “ How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father — glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow — I had a letter this morning — we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty — he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . ”; “ I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , ”; “ Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three , ”; “ I told you yesterday , ”; “ I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ’s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . ”; move.—“He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford ’s , but he need not hurry any body else . ”; “ As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name — I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ? ”; “ Mrs. Bates — we passed her house — I saw Miss Bates at the window . True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is . Call upon her , by all means . ”; “ Well , sir , ”; “ as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . ”; “ But , my dear sir , ”; “ if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . ”; “ You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs . ”; “ Aye , do , Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both . Invite them both . ”; “ Both sir ! Can the old lady ? ”; “ The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . ”; “ Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both . ”; “ He has asked her , my dear . That ’s right . I knew he would ! ”; “ Read it , read it , ”; “ it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines — will not take you long ; read it to Emma . ”; “ Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it?—I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?—Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?—In town next week , you see — at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . ”; “ I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , ”; “ You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , ”; continued—“and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . ”; “ Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . ”; “ You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure . — He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ’s hand , presumed to open it — though it was not directed to me — it was to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter . ”; “ And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston—(laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.—A most dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! ”; “ Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.—This letter tells us — it is a short letter — written in a hurry , merely to give us notice — it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill ’s account — she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her — so they are all to move southward without loss of time . ”; “ Indeed!—from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? ”; “ Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London , a considerable journey . ”; “ Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me — but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses . ”; “ The evil of the distance from Enscombe , ”; “ is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank ’s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ’s ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness — but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . You must grant me that . ”; “ Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect — but this is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _ that _ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . I would not say so to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill ’s illness . ”; “ Aye — like Maple Grove , I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from every thing — in the most complete retirement.—And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . I always say a woman can not have too many resources — and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . ”; “ My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston ’s letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton . ”; “ When Frank left us , ”; “ it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ’s news doubly welcome . It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up — but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ‘ How could he contrive to come ? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ’ and so forth — I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . I have observed , Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . ”; “ You were mentioning May . May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe — in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring — precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time . This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . I think it is so . I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . Mrs. Weston ’s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . She thinks nobody equal to him . ”; “ And I assure you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer . ”; “ I hope , ”; “ I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill . If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish . You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . She was the instigator . Frank ’s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ’s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart . ”; “ But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! ”; “ We thought you were to bring them . ”; “ And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? ”; “ She will think Frank ought to ask her . ”; “ Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?—Come Emma , set your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep ! ”; “ What is this?—What is this ? ”; “ about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I am glad he can afford it . You had it from himself , had you ? ”; “ I am glad you approve of what I have done , ”; “ But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party . A large party secures its own amusement . And she is a good - natured woman after all . One could not leave her out . ”; “ I like your plan , ”; “ Agreed , agreed . I will do my best . I am making a conundrum . How will a conundrum reckon ? ”; “ Low , I am afraid , sir , very low , ”; son;—“but we shall be indulgent — especially to any one who leads the way . ”; “ I doubt its being very clever myself , ”; “ It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ? ”; “ Ah ! you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em - ma.—Do you understand ? ”; Now,”—said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now; ” “; ” “; ” — “; ” said she . “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Emma began to listen better . “; ” continued Mrs. Weston . “; ” “; ” replied Emma dryly , “; ” “; ” thought Emma , “; ” “; ” “; you?”—said Emma , still perplexed . “; ” It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet ’s behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared absolutely changed . She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak . “; “ such things , ”; “ always got about . ”; ” Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ’s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . “; ” said she . He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , “; ” And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ’s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , “; “ It is to be a secret , I conclude , ”; “ These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . ”\n",

      "” said Mr. Knightley , “; ” Yes , good man!—thought Emma — but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? You know nothing of drawing . Do n’t pretend to be in raptures about mine . Keep your raptures for Harriet ’s face . “; side”—after all this , came poor dear Isabella ’s cold approbation of—“Yes; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton ’s only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing ; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . “; ” said she to herself , “; ” “; ” “; “ Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o’clock , ”; Highbury.—“He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . ”—Highbury; “ You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , ”; “ remember that I am here.—Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax ’s situation in life . I will move a little farther off . ”; “ all young people would have their little whims . ”; “ I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , ”; “ I am not fond of dinner - visiting , ”; he—“I never was . No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us — take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . ”; reproach—“Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . ”; “ my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . ”; “ This is the luxury of a large party , ”; she:—“one can get near every body , and say every thing . My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you . I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh . Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ? ”; “ How?—They were invited , were not they ? ”; “ Oh ! yes — but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their coming ? ”; “ They walked , I conclude . How else could they come ? ”; “ Very true.—Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . Poor girl ! I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage . You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ‘ Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!’—but with many , many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr. Knightley ’s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again . ’ I was quite surprized;—very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention — and so thoughtful an attention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of . And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . ”; “ Very likely , ”; Emma—“nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing — to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ’s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to - day — for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . ”; “ Well , ”; “ you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax . See the consequence of keeping you company!—What do you say to it ? ”; “ My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match — I do not want to injure dear little Henry — but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ’s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? ”; “ Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr . Knightley marry!—No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women ! ”; “ But the imprudence of such a match ! ”; “ I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . ”; “ Imprudent , if you please — but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . ”; “ But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry?—He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother ’s children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . ”; “ Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but — ”; “ Well , ”; “ perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home . ”; “ Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously . ”; “ I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased . ”; “ Do come with me , ”; “ if it be not very disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long . We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to call with me . It will be felt so great an attention ! and I always thought you meant it . ”; “ What ! ”; “ have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . ”; “ I do not think it _ is _ so very small . We shall not be many , you know . ”; “ I wish , ”; “ one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object — if one could but tell what that would be . ”; “ Well — if you please , ”; “ if you think she will be of any use . ”; “ But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know . ”; “ that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . ”; “ We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma — but it is better than being always at home . Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . ”; “ I should not wonder , ”; “ if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ’s eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton ’s civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . ”; “ My advice , ”; “ I certainly do feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.—Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again . ”; “ Now , how am I going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend — your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.—No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.—Now for it . ”; “ Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? ”; “ Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me . ”; “ Me!—oh ! no — I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer . ”; “ Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing — Miss Smith . ”; “ Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging — and if I were not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command — but my dancing days are over . ”; “ what became of Mr. Perry ’s plan of setting up his carriage ? ”; “ I did not know that he ever had any such plan . ”; “ Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago . ”; “ Me ! impossible ! ”; “ Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to _ her _ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . You must remember it now ? ”; “ Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . ”; “ Never ! really , never!—Bless me ! how could it be?—Then I must have dreamt it — but I was completely persuaded — Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . ”; of.—“The best fruit in England — every body ’s favourite — always wholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather for one ’s self — the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly the best time — never tired — every sort good — hautboy infinitely superior — no comparison — the others hardly eatable — hautboys very scarce — Chili preferred — white wood finest flavour of all — price of strawberries in London — abundance about Bristol — Maple Grove — cultivation — beds when to be renewed — gardeners thinking exactly different — no general rule — gardeners never to be put out of their way — delicious fruit — only too rich to be eaten much of — inferior to cherries — currants more refreshing — only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping — glaring sun — tired to death — could bear it no longer — must go and sit in the shade . ”; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do . “; “ On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , ”; “ she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ‘ I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart . ”; “ Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ‘ The consequence , ’ said she , ‘ has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . ’ ‘ Do not imagine , madam , ’ she continued , ‘ that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . ’ ”; “ Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . ”; “ We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , ”; “ Are you well , my Emma ? ”; “ Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . ”; ” said he , turning his eyes towards Jane . “; ” But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.—Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . “; ” she cried , “; ” “\n",

      "” They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded . Emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse . She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will . In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away , “; ” Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , “; ” “; ” At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ’s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr. Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , “; ” “; ” “; ” “; “ When I have seen Mr. Elton , ”; “ I dare say I shall be interested — but I believe it requires _ that _ with me . And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . ”; “ Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . ”; “ Handsome ! Oh ! no — far from it — certainly plain . I told you he was plain . ”; “ My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself — ”; “ it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;—let me live them over again . You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds — all the worlds one ever has to give — for another half - hour . ”; “ What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _ has _ made one happy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth . ”; “ Yes , ”; “ we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . ”; “ She is a riddle , quite a riddle ! ”; she.—“To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton ’s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection . ”; “ I went only to the post - office , ”; “ and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . A walk before breakfast does me good . ”; “ No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . ”; “ My dear Jane , what is this I hear?—Going to the post - office in the rain!—This must not be , I assure you.—You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you . ”; “ Oh ! do not tell _ me _ . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.—To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority . ”; significantly—“there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _ us _ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . ”; “ You are extremely kind , ”; “ but I can not give up my early walk . I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . ”; “ My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . ”; “ Excuse me , ”; “ I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ’s . ”; “ Oh ! my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to employ our men . ”; “ The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! ”; she.—“The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! ”; “ It is certainly very well regulated . ”; “ So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong — and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder . ”; “ Here is April come ! ”; “ I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here . ”; “ But have you really heard of nothing ? ”; “ I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet . ”; “ I not aware ! ”; “ dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ? ”; “ Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , ”; “ I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself . But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . ”; “ But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ’s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . ”; “ I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , ”; “ governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . ”; “ You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , ”; “ they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am . ”; “ Will you be so kind , ”; “ when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent — but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any body . It would only be giving trouble and distress . Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ? ”; “ Yes — what should hurt me?—I walk fast . I shall be at home in twenty minutes . ”; “ But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . Let my father ’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage . It can be round in five minutes . ”; “ I am,”—she; “ I do pity you . And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . ”; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” “; ” Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill ’s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence . What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler ’s own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill — which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady . There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma ’s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind . The contrast between Mrs. Churchill ’s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ’s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing — and she sat musing on the difference of woman ’s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ’s saying , “; ” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge ’s at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged — appetite quite gone — and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it otherwise — and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her — be it only an hour or two — from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name — mentioning that she had Mr. Perry ’s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note : “; ” Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates ’s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her — but it would not do;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service — and every thing that message could do was tried — but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.—Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . “; ” “; ” said Emma , “; ” Part only of this answer , however , was admitted . The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to . He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ’s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted . But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father ’s happiness — in other words , his life — required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts . Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . She was sensible of all the affection it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with . She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself . “; ” cried Emma . “; “ Oh ! ”; “ You are very right ; it has been thought of . And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for . ”; ” said Mrs. Weston . “\n",
      "87 Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "\n",
      "“ It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . ”; “ Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire . ”; “ But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold . ”; “ Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them . ”; “ Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding . ”; “ By the bye — I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ? ”; “ Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! ’ Tis a sad business . ”; “ Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly say ‘ poor Miss Taylor . ’ I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . ”; “ I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , ”; “ I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . ”; ” It was , indeed , a highly prized letter . Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ’s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ’s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston ’s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction — her more than satisfaction — her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ‘ poor Miss Taylor , ’ when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse ’s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , “; ” Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr . Elton ’s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . She had not even a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not mentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ’s suspicion . It did , however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude . She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark . She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ’s return . She went to Mrs. Goddard ’s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding — to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred — and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame — and the sight of Harriet ’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . Harriet bore the intelligence very well — blaming nobody — and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend . Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ’s side , not her own . Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved him — and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible . Her tears fell abundantly — but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ’s eyes — and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding — really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two — and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ’s claims , was to promote Harriet ’s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts . Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ’s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton ’s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness — and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . If Mr. Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three . Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society . They must encounter each other , and make the best of it . Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard ’s ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself . CHAPTER XVIII Mr. Frank Churchill did not come . When the time proposed drew near , Mrs. Weston ’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . For the present , he could not be spared , to his “; “ I hope every body had a pleasant evening , ”; “ I had . Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way . I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed . She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . ”; “ It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished — but it is so little one can venture to do — small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon — Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate — Hartfield pork is not like any other pork — but still it is pork — and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork — I think we had better send the leg — do not you think so , my dear ? ”; “ My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter . I knew you would wish it . There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . ”; “ That ’s right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . ”; “ He is very young to settle , ”; “ He had better not be in a hurry . He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . ”; “ I think there are few places with such society as Highbury . I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.—My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork — a roast loin of pork — ”; “ You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? ”; “ then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . ”; “ He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole . ”; “ You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him . We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . ”; “ But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? ”; “ Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise . ”; “ And no great harm if it does , ”; “ The sooner every party breaks up , the better . ”; “ But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma ’s going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ’s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ’s in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years . ”; “ No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious — Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . ”; “ Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time — and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up . ”; “ Oh ! no , ”; “ it would be the extreme of imprudence . I could not bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So would poor little Harriet . So you would all . Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . Pray do not let them talk of it . That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of the draught . I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! ”; “ Sir , ”; “ you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character . Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ’s house . ”; “ Ah ! sir — but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself . ”; “ Have you indeed , sir?—Bless me ! I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over — but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One can not resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . ”; “ I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies are delicate plants . They should take care of their health and their complexion . My dear , did you change your stockings ? ”; “ Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . ”; “ My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . ”; “ Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , ”; “ and always did . And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with; “ Must I go first ? I really am ashamed of always leading the way . ”; “ Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma ’s , and Harriet ’s going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them — very kind and sensible — much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining out . ”\n"
