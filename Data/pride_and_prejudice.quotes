6084	6089	6091	6091	she	429	“ But it is , ”
6093	6110	6091	6091	she	429	“ for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . ”
6117	6129	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Do not you want to know who has taken it ? ”
6136	6154	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . ”
6158	6166	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ He came down to see the place ”
6183	6271	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ”
6272	6278	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ What is his name ? ”
6279	6282	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Bingley . ”
6283	6290	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Is he married or single ? ”
6291	6325	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Oh , single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! ”
6326	6336	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ How so ? how can it affect them ? ”
6337	6343	6345	6346	his wife	322	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ”
6348	6370	6345	6346	his wife	322	“ how can you be so tiresome ? You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . ”
6371	6380	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Is that his design in settling here ? ”
6381	6422	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Design ? Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . ”
6423	6475	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go -- or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better ; for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party . ”
6476	6527	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ My dear , you flatter me . I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown - up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . ”
6528	6544	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . ”
6545	6566	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ”
6567	6580	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ”
6581	6651	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . ”
6652	6712	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ You are over scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . ”
6713	6766	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . ”
6767	6778	6780	6780	he	433	“ They have none of them much to recommend them , ”
6782	6804	6780	6780	he	433	“ they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ”
6805	6837	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion on my poor nerves . ”
6838	6875	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . ”
6876	6887	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Ah , you do not know what I suffer . ”
6888	6915	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . ”
6916	6938	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . ”
6939	6959	6131	6132	his wife	322	“ Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . ”
7079	7087	7093	7094	George Allen	94	“ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it ”
7181	7192	7176	7176	he	130	“ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . ”
7193	7209	7211	7212	her mother	439	“ We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , ”
7216	7224	7211	7212	her mother	439	“ since we are not to visit . ”
7225	7232	7234	7234	Elizabeth	120	“ But you forget , mamma , ”
7236	7256	7234	7234	Elizabeth	120	“ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . ”
7257	7294	7211	7212	her mother	439	“ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . ”
7295	7301	7303	7304	Mr. Bennet	130	“ No more have I , ”
7306	7323	7303	7304	Mr. Bennet	130	“ and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ”
7347	7375	7387	7388	her father	442	“ Do n’t keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven ’s sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . ”
7376	7385	7387	7388	her father	442	“ Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , ”
7390	7396	7387	7388	her father	442	“ she times them ill . ”
7397	7407	7409	7409	Kitty	145	“ I do not cough for my own amusement , ”
7413	7424	7409	7409	Kitty	145	“ When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? ”
7425	7431	7387	7388	her father	442	“ To - morrow fortnight . ”
7432	7439	7441	7442	her mother	439	“ Ay , so it is , ”
7444	7477	7441	7442	her mother	439	“ and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . ”
7478	7502	7387	7388	her father	442	“ Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . ”
7503	7527	7387	7388	her father	442	“ Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ”
7528	7613	7614	7615	The girls	3305	“ I honour your circumspection . A fortnight ’s acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . ”
7626	7631	7621	7622	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Nonsense , nonsense ! ”
7632	7643	7645	7645	he	445	“ What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? ”
7647	7707	7645	7645	he	445	“ Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books , and make extracts . ”
7721	7729	7730	7730	he	445	“ While Mary is adjusting her ideas , ”
7733	7741	7730	7730	he	445	“ let us return to Mr. Bingley . ”
7742	7750	7752	7753	his wife	322	“ I am sick of Mr. Bingley , ”
7755	7815	7730	7730	he	445	“ I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did you not tell me so before ? If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ”
7861	7934	7846	7846	she	322	“ How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! And it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . ”
7935	7949	7951	7952	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ”
7973	7983	7985	7985	she	322	“ What an excellent father you have , girls , ”
7993	8078	7985	7985	she	322	“ I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . At our time of life , it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . ”
8079	8082	8084	8084	Lydia	112	“ Oh , ”
8088	8108	8084	8084	Lydia	112	“ I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I ’m the tallest . ”
8141	8146	8084	8084	Lydia	112	“ I ’m the tallest ”
8151	8157	8084	8084	Lydia	112	“ He rode a black horse ”
8325	8340	8342	8343	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , ”
8348	8365	8342	8343	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . ”
8581	8586	8577	8577	his	459	“ When the Party entered ”
9136	9141	9143	9143	he	142	“ Come , Darcy , ”
9145	9172	9143	9143	he	142	“ I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . ”
9173	9235	9249	9249	Bingley	115	“ I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . ”
9236	9247	9249	9249	Bingley	115	“ I would not be so fastidious as you are , ”
9251	9290	9249	9249	Bingley	115	“ for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ”
9291	9306	9308	9309	Mr. Darcy	142	“ _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , ”
9318	9366	9308	9309	Mr. Darcy	142	“ Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . ”
9370	9374	9308	9309	Mr. Darcy	142	“ She is tolerable ”
9386	9392	9397	9397	he	142	“ Which do you mean ? ”
9420	9477	9411	9411	he	142	“ She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . ”
9742	9750	9752	9752	she	322	“ Oh , my dear Mr. Bennet , ”
9757	9956	9752	9752	she	322	“ we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . I wish you had been there . Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . Only think of _ that _ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the _ Boulanger_---- ”
9957	9969	9971	9972	her husband	453	“ If he had had any compassion for _ me _ , ”
9975	10009	9971	9972	her husband	453	“ he would not have danced half so much ! For God ’s sake , say no more of his partners . O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! ”
10010	10016	10018	10019	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Oh , my dear , ”
10021	10065	10018	10019	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst ’s gown---- ”
10113	10120	10121	10121	she	141	“ But I can assure you , ”
10124	10217	10121	10121	she	141	“ that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . I quite detest the man . ”
10260	10273	10275	10275	she	95	“ He is just what a young - man ought to be , ”
10277	10304	10275	10275	she	95	“ sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! ”
10305	10311	10313	10313	Elizabeth	120	“ He is also handsome , ”
10315	10335	10313	10313	Elizabeth	120	“ which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . ”
10336	10360	10275	10275	she	95	“ I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . ”
10361	10462	10275	10275	she	95	“ Did not you ? _ I _ did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . ”
10463	10467	10313	10313	Elizabeth	120	“ Dear Lizzy ! ”
10468	10521	10275	10275	she	95	“ Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . ”
10522	10542	10275	10275	she	95	“ I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . ”
10543	10647	10313	10313	Elizabeth	120	“ I know you do : and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody ’s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone . And so , you like this man ’s sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . ”
10648	10698	10275	10275	she	95	“ Certainly not , at first ; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . ”
11770	11781	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , ”
11796	11807	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ _ You _ were Mr. Bingley ’s first choice . ”
11808	11820	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ”
11821	11876	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . ”
11877	11968	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson ’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ‘ Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ’ ”
11969	12003	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . ”
12004	12021	12023	12023	Charlotte	154	“ _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , ”
12025	12053	12023	12023	Charlotte	154	“ Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just _ tolerable _ . ”
12054	12117	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ I beg you will not put it into Lizzy ’s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ”
12121	12127	11783	11784	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Without once opening his lips ”
12139	12154	12156	12156	Jane	181	“ Are you quite sure , ma’am ? Is not there a little mistake ? ”
12158	12168	12156	12156	Jane	181	“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ”
12169	12203	12023	12023	Charlotte	154	“ Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . ”
12204	12210	12212	12212	Jane	181	“ Miss Bingley told me , ”
12214	12235	12212	12212	Jane	181	“ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . ”
12236	12312	12023	12023	Charlotte	154	“ I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . ”
12313	12325	12327	12328	Miss Lucas	174	“ I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , ”
12330	12340	12327	12328	Miss Lucas	174	“ but I wish he had danced with Eliza . ”
12341	12347	12349	12350	her mother	439	“ Another time , Lizzy , ”
12352	12367	12349	12350	her mother	439	“ I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . ”
12368	12387	12023	12023	Charlotte	154	“ I believe , ma’am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . ”
12388	12392	12394	12395	Miss Lucas	174	“ His pride , ”
12397	12464	12394	12395	Miss Lucas	174	“ does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . ”
12465	12471	12473	12473	Elizabeth	183	“ That is very true , ”
12475	12495	12473	12473	Elizabeth	183	“ and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . ”
12496	12499	12501	12501	Mary	138	“ Pride , ”
12513	12625	12501	12501	Mary	138	“ is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ; vanity to what we would have others think of us . ”
12626	12636	12638	12640	a young Lucas	589	“ If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , ”
12648	12675	12638	12640	a young Lucas	589	“ I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . ”
12676	12689	12691	12692	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , ”
12694	12713	12691	12692	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . ”
13006	13015	13017	13017	Charlotte	154	“ It may , perhaps , be pleasant , ”
13019	13189	13017	13017	Charlotte	154	“ to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better show _ more _ affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ”
13190	13229	12996	12996	She	181	“ But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ”
13230	13247	12996	12996	She	181	“ Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ’s disposition as you do . ”
13248	13273	13017	13017	Charlotte	154	“ But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . ”
13274	13367	12996	12996	She	181	“ Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ”
13368	13376	13378	13378	Elizabeth	120	“ Your plan is a good one , ”
13380	13503	13378	13378	Elizabeth	120	“ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane ’s feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ”
13504	13554	12996	12996	She	181	“ Not as you represent it . Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . ”
13555	13596	13378	13378	Elizabeth	120	“ Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ”
13597	13600	13602	13602	Charlotte	154	“ Well , ”
13604	13730	13602	13602	Charlotte	154	“ I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ”
13731	13763	13797	13798	Mr. Darcy	142	“ You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ”
14025	14032	14034	14034	she	120	“ What does Mr. Darcy mean , ”
14038	14048	14034	14034	she	120	“ by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? ”
14049	14061	14003	14003	His	142	“ That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . ”
14062	14111	14034	14034	she	120	“ But if he does it any more , I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . ”
14115	14120	14034	14034	she	120	“ The entreaties of several ”
14176	14208	14170	14170	she	174	“ Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? ”
14209	14226	14170	14170	she	174	“ With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ”
14227	14234	14170	14170	she	174	“ You are severe on us . ”
14235	14248	14250	14251	Miss Lucas	174	“ It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , ”
14253	14270	14170	14170	she	174	“ I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . ”
14271	14336	14345	14345	she	174	“ You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ”
14348	14361	14345	14345	she	174	“ Very well ; if it must be so , it must . ”
14369	14401	14345	14345	she	174	“ There is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and I shall keep mine to swell my song . ”
14642	14678	14638	14639	Sir William	167	“ What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing , after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . ”
14679	14708	14709	14710	Sir William	167	“ Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world : every savage can dance . ”
14714	14720	14721	14721	he	167	“ Your friend performs delightfully , ”
14735	14753	14721	14721	he	167	“ and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . ”
14754	14767	14638	14639	Sir William	167	“ You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . ”
14768	14791	14721	14721	he	167	“ Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James ’s ? ”
14792	14797	14721	14721	he	167	“ Never , sir . ”
14798	14813	14638	14639	Sir William	167	“ Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? ”
14814	14832	14721	14721	he	167	“ It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . ”
14833	14844	14845	14846	Mr. Darcy	142	“ You have a house in town , I conclude ? ”
14849	14887	14888	14888	He	142	“ I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . ”
14933	14984	14991	14991	he	142	“ My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . ”
15027	15060	15061	15062	Mr. Darcy	142	“ Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . ”
15101	15154	15088	15089	Sir William	167	“ You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . ”
15155	15162	15164	15164	Elizabeth	120	“ Mr. Darcy is all politeness , ”
15168	15201	15164	15164	Elizabeth	120	“ He is , indeed : but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? ”
15236	15246	15234	15235	Miss Bingley,--	188	“ I can guess the subject of your reverie . ”
15247	15253	15234	15235	Miss Bingley,--	188	“ I should imagine not . ”
15254	15324	15234	15235	Miss Bingley,--	188	“ You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society ; and , indeed , I am quite of your opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self - importance , of all these people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! ”
15325	15368	15369	15370	Miss Bingley	173	“ Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . ”
15402	15407	15234	15235	Miss Bingley,--	188	“ Miss Elizabeth Bennet . ”
15408	15413	15415	15416	Miss Bingley	173	“ Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! ”
15418	15443	15415	15416	Miss Bingley	173	“ I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? ”
15444	15490	15395	15396	Mr. Darcy	142	“ That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady ’s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . ”
15491	15536	15537	15537	He	627	“ Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . ”
15574	15580	15537	15537	He	627	“ A note for Miss Bennet ”
16002	16040	15998	15999	Mr. Bennet	130	“ From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . ”
16089	16097	16099	16100	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ I am astonished , my dear , ”
16102	16137	16099	16100	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody ’s children , it should not be of my own , however . ”
16138	16155	16060	16060	her	181	“ If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . ”
16156	16172	16099	16100	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . ”
16173	16220	16060	16060	her	181	“ This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . ”
16221	16340	16060	16060	her	181	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ’s in his regimentals . ”
16341	16344	16346	16346	Lydia	181	“ Mamma , ”
16348	16387	16346	16346	Lydia	181	“ my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson ’s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke ’s library . ”
16438	16474	16428	16428	she	141	“ Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . ”
16475	16482	16484	16484	Jane	181	“ It is from Miss Bingley , ”
16495	16502	16428	16428	she	141	“ My dear friend , * / “
16585	16589	16582	16582	Yours	661	“ CAROLINE BINGLEY . ”
16590	16595	16597	16597	Lydia	181	“ With the officers ! ”
16599	16613	16597	16597	Lydia	181	“ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ”
16614	16618	16620	16621	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Dining out , ”
16623	16629	16620	16621	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ that is very unlucky . ”
16630	16637	16639	16639	Jane	181	“ Can I have the carriage ? ”
16641	16669	16639	16639	Jane	181	“ No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . ”
16670	16678	16680	16680	Elizabeth	120	“ That would be a good scheme , ”
16682	16697	16680	16680	Elizabeth	120	“ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ”
16698	16724	16639	16639	Jane	181	“ Oh , but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley ’s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . ”
16725	16735	16639	16639	Jane	181	“ I had much rather go in the coach . ”
16736	16768	16639	16639	Jane	181	“ But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? ”
16775	16790	16639	16639	Jane	181	“ They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . ”
16791	16802	16804	16804	Elizabeth	120	“ But if you have got them to - day , ”
16806	16815	16804	16804	Elizabeth	120	“ my mother ’s purpose will be answered . ”
16903	16914	16916	16917	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! ”
16973	16980	16972	16972	NIND	197	“ My dearest Lizzie , * / “
17064	17069	17078	17079	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Yours , etc . ”
17070	17076	17078	17079	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Well , my dear , ”
17089	17128	17078	17079	Mr. Bennet	130	“ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . ”
17129	17185	17186	17186	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go and see her if I could have the carriage . ”
17225	17233	17220	17220	She	120	“ How can you be so silly , ”
17238	17265	17220	17220	She	120	“ as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . ”
17266	17282	17235	17236	her mother	439	“ I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . ”
17283	17293	17295	17296	her father	442	“ Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , ”
17298	17305	17295	17296	her father	442	“ to send for the horses ? ”
17306	17342	17235	17236	her mother	439	“ No , indeed . I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . ”
17343	17352	17354	17354	Mary	138	“ I admire the activity of your benevolence , ”
17356	17385	17354	17354	Mary	138	“ but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ”
17386	17397	17399	17399	Catherine	145	“ We will go as far as Meryton with you , ”
17417	17423	17425	17425	Lydia	181	“ If we make haste , ”
17432	17446	17425	17425	Lydia	181	“ perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . ”
18032	18036	18006	18007	a servant	704	“ The Apothecary came ”
18041	18045	18006	18007	a servant	704	“ covering a screen ”
18380	18413	18372	18373	Mrs. Hurst	172	“ She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . ”
18414	18461	18372	18373	Mrs. Hurst	172	“ She did indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must _ she _ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair so untidy , so blowzy ! ”
18462	18503	18372	18373	Mrs. Hurst	172	“ Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . ”
18504	18514	18516	18516	Bingley	173	“ Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , ”
18518	18552	18516	18516	Bingley	173	“ but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . ”
18553	18567	18569	18570	Miss Bingley	173	“ _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , ”
18572	18595	18569	18570	Miss Bingley	173	“ and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . ”
18596	18600	18516	18516	Bingley	173	“ Certainly not . ”
18601	18661	18569	18570	Miss Bingley	173	“ To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . ”
18662	18675	18677	18677	Bingley	173	“ It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , ”
18679	18687	18677	18677	Bingley	173	“ I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , ”
18697	18711	18689	18690	Miss Bingley	173	“ that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . ”
18712	18717	18718	18718	he	716	“ Not at all , ”
18721	18729	18718	18718	he	716	“ they were brightened by the exercise . ”
18742	18791	18738	18739	Mrs. Hurst	172	“ I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . ”
18792	18809	18689	18690	Miss Bingley	173	“ I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton ? ”
18810	18824	18738	18739	Mrs. Hurst	172	“ Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . ”
18825	18830	18832	18833	her sister	525	“ That is capital , ”
18841	18854	18856	18856	Bingley	173	“ If they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ Cheapside , ”
18858	18869	18891	18891	Darcy	142	“ it would not make them one jot less agreeable . ”
18870	18889	18891	18891	Darcy	142	“ But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , ”
19075	19083	19085	19085	he	171	“ Do you prefer reading to cards ? ”
19087	19093	19085	19085	he	171	“ that is rather singular . ”
19094	19099	19101	19102	Miss Bingley	173	“ Miss Eliza Bennet , ”
19104	19122	19101	19102	Miss Bingley	173	“ despises cards . She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . ”
19123	19133	19135	19135	Elizabeth	120	“ I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , ”
19137	19155	19135	19135	Elizabeth	120	“ I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . ”
19156	19168	19170	19170	Bingley	173	“ In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , ”
19172	19187	19170	19170	Bingley	173	“ and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . ”
19222	19261	19208	19208	He	171	“ And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow ; and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . ”
19277	19282	19284	19285	Miss Bingley	173	“ I am astonished , ”
19287	19313	19284	19285	Miss Bingley	173	“ that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! ”
19314	19321	19322	19322	he	171	“ It ought to be good , ”
19325	19335	19322	19322	he	171	“ it has been the work of many generations . ”
19336	19354	19284	19285	Miss Bingley	173	“ And then you have added so much to it yourself -- you are always buying books . ”
19355	19372	19284	19285	Miss Bingley	173	“ I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . ”
19373	19414	19322	19322	he	171	“ Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build _ your _ house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . ”
19415	19421	19284	19285	Miss Bingley	173	“ I wish it may . ”
19422	19457	19284	19285	Miss Bingley	173	“ But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . ”
19458	19476	19322	19322	he	171	“ With all my heart : I will buy Pemberley itself , if Darcy will sell it . ”
19477	19486	19284	19285	Miss Bingley	173	“ I am talking of possibilities , Charles . ”
19487	19509	19322	19322	he	171	“ Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . ”
19562	19572	19574	19575	Miss Bingley	173	“ Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? ”
19577	19587	19574	19575	Miss Bingley	173	“ will she be as tall as I am ? ”
19588	19608	19574	19575	Miss Bingley	173	“ I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ’s height , or rather taller . ”
19609	19652	19574	19575	Miss Bingley	173	“ How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners , and so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . ”
19653	19660	19662	19662	Bingley	115	“ It is amazing to me , ”
19664	19681	19662	19662	Bingley	115	“ how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . ”
19682	19697	19574	19575	Miss Bingley	173	“ All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? ”
19698	19758	19574	19575	Miss Bingley	173	“ Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . ”
19759	19769	19771	19771	Darcy	152	“ Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , ”
19773	19844	19771	19771	Darcy	152	“ has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen ; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half - a - dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished . ”
19845	19853	19855	19856	Miss Bingley	173	“ Nor I , I am sure , ”
19858	19861	19863	19863	Elizabeth	120	“ Then , ”
19865	19880	19863	19863	Elizabeth	120	“ you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . ”
19881	19893	19771	19771	Darcy	152	“ Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . ”
19894	19899	19901	19903	his faithful assistant	732	“ Oh , certainly , ”
19905	19990	19901	19903	his faithful assistant	732	“ no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and , besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . ”
19991	19998	20000	20000	Darcy	152	“ All this she must possess , ”
20002	20023	20000	20000	Darcy	152	“ and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . ”
20024	20051	19901	19903	his faithful assistant	732	“ I am no longer surprised at your knowing _ only _ six accomplished women . I rather wonder now at your knowing _ any _ . ”
20052	20070	20000	20000	Darcy	152	“ Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ”
20071	20104	19901	19903	his faithful assistant	732	“ _ I _ never saw such a woman . _ I _ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . ”
20171	20175	20177	20178	Miss Bingley	173	“ Eliza Bennet , ”
20188	20237	20177	20178	Miss Bingley	173	“ is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I daresay , it succeeds ; but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . ”
20238	20241	20243	20243	Darcy	152	“ Undoubtedly , ”
20253	20280	20243	20243	Darcy	152	“ there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . ”
20742	20749	20751	20751	her	141	“ Indeed I have , sir , ”
20754	20787	20751	20751	her	141	“ She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . ”
20788	20791	20793	20793	Bingley	173	“ Removed ! ”
20795	20817	20793	20793	Bingley	173	“ It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . ”
20818	20827	20829	20830	Miss Bingley	173	“ You may depend upon it , madam , ”
20836	20851	20829	20830	Miss Bingley	173	“ that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . ”
20860	20865	20866	20866	she	141	“ I am sure , ”
20869	21004	20866	20866	she	141	“ if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . ”
21005	21015	21017	21017	he	761	“ Whatever I do is done in a hurry , ”
21019	21052	21017	21017	he	761	“ and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . ”
21053	21065	21067	21067	Elizabeth	120	“ That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , ”
21069	21079	21081	21081	he	761	“ You begin to comprehend me , do you ? ”
21087	21096	21081	21081	he	761	“ Oh yes -- I understand you perfectly . ”
21097	21123	21017	21017	he	761	“ I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through , I am afraid , is pitiful . ”
21124	21154	21160	21161	her mother	439	“ That is as it happens . It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . ”
21155	21158	21160	21161	her mother	439	“ Lizzy , ”
21163	21187	21160	21161	her mother	439	“ remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ”
21188	21195	21197	21197	Bingley	115	“ I did not know before , ”
21201	21217	21197	21197	Bingley	115	“ that you were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . ”
21218	21238	21160	21161	her mother	439	“ Yes ; but intricate characters are the _ most _ amusing . They have at least that advantage . ”
21239	21243	21245	21245	Darcy	152	“ The country , ”
21247	21274	21245	21245	Darcy	152	“ can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . ”
21275	21296	21160	21161	her mother	439	“ But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . ”
21297	21302	21304	21305	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Yes , indeed , ”
21317	21339	21160	21161	her mother	439	“ I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . ”
21376	21417	21374	21374	her	141	“ I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr. Bingley ? ”
21418	21426	21427	21427	he	115	“ When I am in the country , ”
21430	21467	21427	21427	he	115	“ I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town , it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . ”
21468	21484	21374	21374	her	141	“ Ay , that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , ”
21489	21500	21487	21487	Darcy	152	“ seemed to think the country was nothing at all . ”
21501	21510	21512	21512	Elizabeth	120	“ Indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , ”
21519	21557	21512	21512	Elizabeth	120	“ You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ”
21558	21601	21516	21517	her mother	439	“ Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . I know we dine with four - and - twenty families . ”
21667	21742	21654	21655	Charlotte Lucas	154	“ Yes , she called yesterday with her father . What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley -- is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to everybody . _ That _ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter . ”
21743	21750	21623	21623	her	766	“ Did Charlotte dine with you ? ”
21751	21852	21654	21655	Charlotte Lucas	154	“ No , she would go home . I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies . For my part , Mr. Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently . But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you . It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain ; but then she is our particular friend . ”
21853	21862	21864	21864	Bingley	115	“ She seems a very pleasant young woman , ”
21866	22010	21864	21864	Bingley	115	“ Oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ’s beauty . I do not like to boast of my own child ; but to be sure , Jane -- one does not often see anybody better looking . It is what everybody says . I do not trust my own partiality . When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ’s in town so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . But , however , he did not . Perhaps he thought her too young . However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . ”
22011	22018	22020	22020	Elizabeth	120	“ And so ended his affection , ”
22024	22055	22020	22020	Elizabeth	120	“ There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! ”
22056	22072	22074	22074	Darcy	142	“ I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , ”
22076	22121	22074	22074	Darcy	142	“ Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . ”
22437	22488	22489	22489	Lydia	181	“ I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? ”
22494	22536	22537	22537	she	181	“ Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given _ your _ ball , ”
22540	22566	22537	22537	she	181	“ I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . ”
22834	22847	22848	22848	He	142	“ How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! ”
22853	22859	22848	22848	He	142	“ You write uncommonly fast . ”
22860	22870	22829	22829	her	791	“ You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . ”
22871	22901	22829	22829	her	791	“ How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year ! Letters of business , too ! How odious I should think them ! ”
22902	22920	22848	22848	He	142	“ It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . ”
22921	22933	22829	22829	her	791	“ Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . ”
22934	22947	22829	22829	her	791	“ I have already told her so once , by your desire . ”
22948	22972	22829	22829	her	791	“ I am afraid you do not like your pen . Let me mend it for you . I mend pens remarkably well . ”
22973	22984	22848	22848	He	142	“ Thank you -- but I always mend my own . ”
22985	22995	22996	22996	He	792	“ How can you contrive to write so even ? ”
23000	23047	22996	22996	He	792	“ Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley ’s . ”
23048	23074	22848	22848	He	142	“ Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . ”
23075	23106	22848	22848	He	142	“ Oh , it is of no consequence . I shall see her in January . But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr. Darcy ? ”
23107	23126	22996	22996	He	792	“ They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . ”
23127	23151	22848	22848	He	142	“ It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write ill . ”
23152	23165	23167	23168	her brother	3404	“ That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , ”
23170	23197	22848	22848	He	142	“ because he does _ not _ write with ease . He studies too much for words of four syllables . Do not you , Darcy ? ”
23198	23209	22848	22848	He	142	“ My style of writing is very different from yours . ”
23210	23213	23215	23216	Miss Bingley	173	“ Oh , ”
23218	23240	23215	23216	Miss Bingley	173	“ Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . ”
23241	23271	22848	22848	He	142	“ My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them ; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . ”
23272	23279	23281	23281	Elizabeth	120	“ Your humility , Mr. Bingley , ”
23283	23288	23281	23281	Elizabeth	120	“ must disarm reproof . ”
23289	23295	23297	23297	Darcy	142	“ Nothing is more deceitful , ”
23299	23320	23297	23297	Darcy	142	“ than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . ”
23321	23339	22848	22848	He	142	“ And which of the two do you call _ my _ little recent piece of modesty ? ”
23340	23483	22848	22848	He	142	“ The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself ; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? ”
23484	23487	23489	23489	Bingley	115	“ Nay , ”
23491	23560	23489	23489	Bingley	115	“ this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . ”
23561	23652	22848	22848	He	142	“ I daresay you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ‘ Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ’ you would probably do it -- you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . ”
23653	23661	23663	23663	Elizabeth	120	“ You have only proved by this , ”
23665	23691	23663	23663	Elizabeth	120	“ that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . ”
23692	23698	23700	23700	Bingley	115	“ I am exceedingly gratified , ”
23702	23772	23700	23700	Bingley	115	“ by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . ”
23773	23796	22848	22848	He	142	“ Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? ”
23797	23816	22848	22848	He	142	“ Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter -- Darcy must speak for himself . ”
23817	23897	23700	23700	Bingley	115	“ You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . ”
23898	23919	22848	22848	He	142	“ To yield readily -- easily -- to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit with you . ”
23920	23934	22848	22848	He	142	“ To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . ”
23935	24072	23700	23700	Bingley	115	“ You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases , between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? ”
24073	24117	22848	22848	He	142	“ Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? ”
24118	24123	24125	24125	Bingley	115	“ By all means , ”
24127	24232	24125	24125	Bingley	115	“ let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size , for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . ”
24276	24284	24286	24287	his friend	323	“ I see your design , Bingley , ”
24289	24301	24286	24287	his friend	323	“ You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . ”
24302	24347	24379	24379	her	120	“ Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . ”
24348	24353	24355	24355	Elizabeth	120	“ What you ask , ”
24357	24375	24355	24355	Elizabeth	120	“ is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . ”
24613	24635	24603	24604	Mr. Darcy	142	“ Do you not feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? ”
24656	24659	24661	24661	she	120	“ Oh , ”
24663	24757	24661	24661	she	120	“ I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ‘ Yes , ’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all ; and now despise me if you dare . ”
24758	24765	24766	24766	Elizabeth	120	“ Indeed I do not dare . ”
24904	24908	24910	24910	she	120	“ I hope , ”
24924	25001	24910	24910	she	120	“ you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ”
25005	25014	24910	24910	she	120	“ No , no ; stay where you are ”
25026	25038	24910	24910	she	120	“ Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? ”
25039	25114	24910	24910	she	120	“ Oh yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great - uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth ’s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? ”
25115	25147	24910	24910	she	120	“ It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression ; but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . ”
25164	25175	25177	25178	Miss Bingley	173	“ I did not know that you intended to walk , ”
25190	25197	25199	25200	Mrs. Hurst	172	“ You used us abominably ill , ”
25202	25214	25199	25200	Mrs. Hurst	172	“ running away without telling us that you were coming out . ”
25247	25266	25238	25239	Mr. Darcy	142	“ This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . ”
25283	25318	25319	25319	She	120	“ No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good - bye . ”
25369	25374	25380	25381	George Allen	94	“ Piling up the fire ”
25549	25553	25547	25547	he	142	“ very glad ; ”
25885	25944	25877	25877	she	173	“ How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . ”
25993	26054	25986	25986	she	173	“ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ”
26055	26061	26063	26064	her brother	3404	“ If you mean Darcy , ”
26066	26111	25986	25986	she	173	“ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . ”
26112	26120	26121	26121	she	173	“ I should like balls infinitely better , ”
26124	26169	26121	26121	she	173	“ if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . ”
26170	26195	26196	26197	Miss Bingley	173	“ Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball . ”
26259	26296	26245	26245	she	173	“ Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ”
26422	26427	26415	26415	she	120	“ Not at all , ”
26432	26462	26415	26415	she	120	“ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . ”
26491	26502	26504	26504	he	142	“ I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , ”
26515	26587	26504	26504	he	142	“ You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ’s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ”
26588	26593	26595	26596	Miss Bingley	173	“ Oh , shocking ! ”
26598	26616	26595	26596	Miss Bingley	173	“ I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? ”
26617	26629	26631	26631	Elizabeth	120	“ Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ”
26633	26665	26631	26631	Elizabeth	120	“ We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him -- laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . ”
26666	26743	26595	26596	Miss Bingley	173	“ But upon my honour I do _ not _ . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no ; I feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . ”
26744	26754	26756	26756	Elizabeth	120	“ Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! ”
26758	26796	26756	26756	Elizabeth	120	“ That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance . I dearly love a laugh . ”
26797	26801	26803	26803	he	833	“ Miss Bingley , ”
26805	26845	26803	26803	he	833	“ has given me credit for more than can be . The wisest and best of men,--nay , the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . ”
26846	26849	26851	26851	Elizabeth	120	“ Certainly , ”
26853	26921	26851	26851	Elizabeth	120	“ there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . ”
26922	26953	26756	26756	Elizabeth	120	“ Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . ”
26954	26961	26803	26803	he	833	“ Such as vanity and pride . ”
26962	26991	26992	26992	Elizabeth	120	“ Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind -- pride will be always under good regulation . ”
27000	27012	27014	27015	Miss Bingley	173	“ Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , ”
27017	27025	27014	27015	Miss Bingley	173	“ and pray what is the result ? ”
27026	27047	26803	26803	he	833	“ I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . ”
27048	27051	27053	27053	Darcy	142	“ No , ”
27055	27160	27053	27053	Darcy	142	“ I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . ”
27161	27171	27173	27173	Elizabeth	120	“ _ That _ is a failing , indeed ! ”
27175	27211	27173	27173	Elizabeth	120	“ Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not _ laugh _ at it . You are safe from me . ”
27212	27242	27053	27053	Darcy	142	“ There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . ”
27243	27256	27173	27173	Elizabeth	120	“ And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . ”
27257	27261	27262	27262	he	834	“ And yours , ”
27269	27276	27262	27262	he	834	“ is wilfully to misunderstand them . ”
27277	27286	27288	27289	Miss Bingley	173	“ Do let us have a little music , ”
27302	27314	27297	27297	she	173	“ Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . ”
28143	28150	28152	28153	Mr. Bennet	130	“ I hope , my dear , ”
28167	28192	28152	28153	Mr. Bennet	130	“ that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . ”
28193	28247	28152	28153	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . ”
28248	28262	28263	28264	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger . ”
28269	28355	28263	28264	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure . Why , Jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . But -- good Lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell . I must speak to Hill this moment . ”
28356	28365	28367	28368	her husband	453	“ It is _ not _ Mr. Bingley , ”
28370	28387	28367	28368	her husband	453	“ it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . ”
28423	28486	28421	28421	he	453	explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it ; for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . ”
28487	28493	28495	28496	his wife	322	“ Oh , my dear , ”
28498	28566	28495	28496	his wife	322	“ I can not bear to hear that mentioned . Pray do not talk of that odious man . I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . ”
28636	28645	28647	28648	Mr. Bennet	130	“ It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ”
28650	28689	28647	28648	Mr. Bennet	130	“ and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ”
28690	28744	28605	28605	she	141	“ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? ”
28745	28768	28647	28648	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . ”
28772	28787	28605	28605	she	141	“ Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , _ 15th October _ . * / “
28791	28874	28876	28877	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ; and , since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach : but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . ”--‘There
28879	29214	29215	29216	WILLIAM COLLINS	206	’--“My mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o’clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , “

29369	29400	29366	29366	his	875	” Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required . “

29552	29818	29819	29819	You	881	” To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . As for their mother , Mr. Collins ’s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters . Mr. Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . Mr. Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . He was a tall , heavy - looking young man of five - and - twenty . His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- “
29856	29857	29858	29858	You	881	” “
29870	29871	29858	29858	You	881	” “

30004	30522	30545	30545	she	892	” He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins ’s admiration . The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet ’s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . The dinner , too , in its turn , was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing . But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him , with some asperity , that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen . He begged pardon for having displeased her . In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XIV [ Illustration ] During dinner , Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . Lady Catherine de Bourgh ’s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better . Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise . The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner ; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people , he knew , but _ he _ had never seen anything but affability in her . She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations . She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs . “
30535	30540	30545	30545	she	892	” said Mrs. Bennet , “
30575	30576	30568	30568	she	892	” “
30600	30601	30602	30602	I	0	” “
30618	30619	30620	30620	She	892	” “
30637	30638	30622	30624	one only daughter	904	” “
30641	30650	30622	30624	one only daughter	904	” cried Mrs. Bennet , shaking her head , “
30673	30674	30670	30670	she	892	” “
30794	30795	30773	30773	she	892	” “
30813	30814	30815	30815	Her	892	” “
30951	30952	30953	30953	You	917	” “
30958	30963	30953	30953	You	917	” said Mr. Bennet ; “
31003	31004	30981	30981	I	0	” “
31051	31151	31154	31154	he	0	” Mr. Bennet ’s expectations were fully answered . His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped ; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and , except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . By tea - time , however , the dose had been enough , and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him [ Illustration : “
31158	31233	31234	31234	Fordyce	207	” H.T Feb 94 ] to read aloud to the ladies . Mr. Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it ( for everything announced it to be from a circulating library ) he started back , and , begging pardon , protested that he never read novels . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose “
31238	31265	31234	31234	Fordyce	207	” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume ; and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with,-- “
31327	31355	31320	31321	Mr. Denny	209	” Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr. Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said,-- “
31410	31952	31401	31401	I	0	” Then , turning to Mr. Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia ’s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XV . [ Illustration ] Mr. Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance . The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . This was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father ’s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ’s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _ she _ was his settled choice . The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ’s _ tête - à - tête _ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . “
32012	33212	31995	31995	she	929	” Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire . Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces . Lydia ’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten : every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford . Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly . In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _ him _ . Their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet , indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recall them . But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentlemanlike appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . All were struck with the stranger ’s air , all wondered who he could be ; and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement , when the two gentlemen , turning back , had reached the same spot . Mr. Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr. Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and , he was happy to say , had accepted a commission in their corps . This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . His appearance was greatly in his favour : he had all the best parts of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street . On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object . He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger ; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return . What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . In another minute Mr. Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips ’s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ’s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs. Philips ’s throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation . Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome ; and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones ’s shopboy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield , because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane ’s introduction of him . She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologizing for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr. Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant ’s commission in the ----shire . She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “
33218	33972	33213	33218	stupid , disagreeable fellows . ”	3850	” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . This was agreed to ; and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured , with unwearying civility , that they were perfectly needless . As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips ’s manners and politeness . He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . Something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XVI . [ Illustration ] As no objection was made to the young people ’s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr. Collins ’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle ’s invitation , and was then in the house . When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ’s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ’s room . In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . It was over at last , however . The gentlemen did approach : and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable , gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr , Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _ they _ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . [ Illustration : “
33978	34158	33213	33218	stupid , disagreeable fellows . ”	3850	” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her , in return , by sitting down to whist . “
34168	34172	34159	34159	I	0	” said he , “
34188	34394	34416	34416	he	932	” Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . Mr. Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . At first there seemed danger of Lydia ’s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for anyone in particular . Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy . She dared not even mention that gentleman . Her curiosity , however , was unexpectedly relieved . Mr. Wickham began the subject himself . He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there . “
34399	34415	34416	34416	he	932	” said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , “
34430	34431	34416	34416	he	932	” “
34434	34438	34416	34416	he	932	” replied Wickham ; “
34493	34501	34502	34502	You	935	” Elizabeth could not but look surprised . “
34541	34542	34538	34539	Mr. Darcy	142	” “
34552	34558	34538	34539	Mr. Darcy	142	” cried Elizabeth , warmly . “

34591	34595	34587	34587	my	0	” said Wickham , “

34737	34746	34729	34729	I	0	” said Wickham , after a short interruption , “
34804	34805	34806	34806	I	0	” “
34827	34834	34835	34835	I	0	” Wickham only shook his head . “
34838	34849	34835	34835	I	0	” said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , “
34862	34863	34864	34864	I	0	” “
34907	34908	34887	34887	I	0	” “
35085	35155	35063	35063	I	0	” Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry . Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter , especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . “
35168	35172	35063	35063	I	0	” he added , “
35323	35324	35314	35315	the gentleman	482	” “

35667	35686	35657	35657	I	0	” Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . “
35690	35698	35702	35702	his	142	” said she , after a pause , “
35715	35716	35702	35702	his	142	” “
35802	35803	35804	35804	I	0	” “
35866	35879	35880	35880	I	0	” After a few minutes ’ reflection , however , she continued , “
35913	35914	35907	35907	His	142	” “
35924	35928	35930	35930	I	0	” replied Wickham ; “
35939	35953	35930	35930	I	0	” Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , “
35972	35978	35979	35981	A young man	3389	” She could have added , “
36000	36005	35979	35981	A young man	3389	” But she contented herself with--“And
36034	36035	36026	36026	you	981	” “
36210	36211	36189	36189	he	142	” “
36215	36219	36189	36189	he	142	” cried Elizabeth . “
36264	36265	36259	36259	I	0	” “
36272	36276	36259	36259	I	0	” replied Wickham ; “

36345	36346	36310	36310	we	996	” “
36479	36480	36466	36466	him	142	” “
36490	36496	36487	36488	Miss Darcy	152	” He shook his head . “
36605	36629	36594	36595	a lady	3450	” After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying,-- “
36683	36684	36678	36678	you	0	” “
36689	36690	36678	36678	you	0	” “
36712	36713	36708	36709	Mr. Darcy	142	” “
36807	36912	36913	36913	I	0	” The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her , with much earnest gravity , that it was not of the least importance ; that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . “
36920	36924	36918	36918	madam	3571	” said he , “
36991	37030	36974	36977	Lady Catherine de Bourgh	145	” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “
37036	37040	37031	37034	Lady Catherine de Bourgh	145	” she replied , “
37071	37072	37063	37063	he	116	” “
37100	37101	37095	37098	the present Mr. Darcy	142	” “
37133	37134	37135	37135	Her	145	” “
37164	37211	37212	37213	Mr. Collins	116	” This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another . “
37215	37219	37212	37213	Mr. Collins	116	” said she , “
37269	37270	37261	37261	she	145	” “
37282	37286	37273	37273	her	145	” replied Wickham ; “
37375	37602	37356	37357	her nephew	1034	” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham ’s attentions . There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips ’s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully . Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent . Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr. Collins , in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .

Jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley ’s regard ; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained . “

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet ’s civilities . The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy ’s look and behaviour . The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball . And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . “
38438	38442	38048	38048	your	0	” said she , “
38486	38585	38468	38468	I	0	” Elizabeth ’s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley ’s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance . “
38598	38602	38594	38594	I	0	” said he , “
38703	39295	39296	39296	I	0	” Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed . There was no help for it , however . Mr. Wickham ’s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins ’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ . Elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . Mr. Collins might never make the offer , and , till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time ; for , from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe - roses for Netherfield were got by proxy . Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XVIII . [ Illustration ] Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield , and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted , for Mr. Darcy ’s pleasure , in the Bingleys ’ invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile,-- “
39322	39706	39707	39707	I	0	” This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth ; and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ’s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham . She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill - humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and , having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress : they were dances of mortification . Mr. Collins , awkward and solemn , apologizing instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . The moment of her release from him was ecstasy . She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . When those dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind : Charlotte tried to console her . “
39717	39718	39710	39710	you	0	” “
39753	39943	39947	39947	your	1066	” When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her , in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence . Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it . They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and , at first , was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . He replied , and was again silent . After a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time , with-- “
39990	40008	39968	39968	you	1066	” He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . “
40050	40051	40053	40053	you	1066	” “
40065	40066	40053	40053	you	1066	” “
40123	40124	40126	40126	you	1066	” “
40146	40147	40138	40138	you	1066	” “
40150	40155	40138	40138	you	1066	” replied Elizabeth archly ; “
40214	40215	40254	40254	You	0	” “
40231	40235	40227	40227	I	0	” said he . “
40264	40265	40254	40254	You	0	” “
40275	40327	40329	40329	you	0	” He made no answer ; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . She answered in the affirmative ; and , unable to resist the temptation , added , “
40346	40397	40329	40329	you	0	” The effect was immediate . A deeper shade of _ hauteur _ overspread his features , but he said not a word ; and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said,-- “
40431	40432	40433	40433	He	113	” “
40444	40451	40433	40433	He	113	” replied Elizabeth , with emphasis , “
40467	40533	40534	40534	I	0	” Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but , on perceiving Mr. Darcy , he stopped , with a bow of superior courtesy , to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . “
40664	40668	40652	40654	that young lady	1081	” [ Illustration : “
40678	40753	40754	40755	Sir William	167	” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed , with a very serious expression , towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said,-- “
40768	40769	40770	40770	I	0	” “
40824	40825	40819	40819	I	0	” “
40832	40838	40828	40828	you	0	” said he , smiling . “

40932	40942	40884	40884	We	1082	” said he , with a look of doubt . “
40947	40976	40884	40884	We	1082	” she replied , without knowing what she said ; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , “
41017	41018	41019	41019	I	0	” “
41022	41031	41019	41019	I	0	” said he , with a firm voice . “

41094	41105	41106	41106	I	0	” said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . “

41122	41128	41129	41129	I	0	” She shook her head . “

41156	41162	41151	41151	I	0	” answered he , gravely , “
41210	41211	41182	41182	you	120	” “
41229	41230	41231	41231	I	0	” “
41242	41328	41231	41231	I	0	” he coldly replied . She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree ; for in Darcy ’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her,-- “
41585	41586	41587	41587	His	142	” “
41603	41609	41595	41595	your	0	” said Elizabeth , angrily ; “
41647	41648	41642	41642	he	142	” “
41654	41665	41651	41651	your	0	” replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer . “
41675	41676	41677	41678	Insolent girl	1100	” “
41680	41686	41677	41678	Insolent girl	1100	” said Elizabeth to herself . “
41722	41817	41719	41720	Mr. Darcy	142	” She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings ; and , at that moment , solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of Jane ’s being in the fairest way for happiness . “
41823	41838	41818	41818	I	0	” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ’s , “
41873	41874	41865	41865	you	0	” “
41877	41881	41865	41865	you	0	” replied Jane , “
42008	42009	42010	42011	Mr. Bingley	115	” “
42019	42020	42017	42017	himself	113	” “
42034	42035	42023	42023	he	115	” “
42062	42063	42056	42056	he	115	” “
42098	42099	42085	42085	he	115	” “
42111	42116	42100	42100	I	0	” said Elizabeth warmly , “
42182	42297	42298	42298	I	0	” She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ’s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . “
42303	42307	42333	42333	himself	0	” said he , “
42444	42445	42446	42446	You	0	” “
42457	42458	42460	42460	I	0	” “
42505	42605	42606	42606	My	0	” Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus,-- “
42785	42858	42783	42783	yourself	120	” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words “
42861	42862	42863	42863	Hunsford	9	” “
42865	42867	42863	42863	Hunsford	9	” and “
42873	42969	42970	42970	I	0	” It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder ; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . Mr. Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr. Darcy ’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech ; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way : Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth . “
42979	42983	42970	42970	I	0	” said he , “
43059	43538	43052	43052	I	0	” As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ’s two sisters . Her mother ’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley . It was an animating subject , and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and , lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ’s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them . Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . “
43582	43583	43556	43556	I	0	” “
43618	44034	43606	43606	You	3571	” Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . At length , however , Mrs. Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . Elizabeth now began to revive . But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . Elizabeth ’s eyes were fixed on her , with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . Mary ’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in agonies . She looked at Jane to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued , however , impenetrably grave . She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . He took the hint , and , when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud,-- “
44060	44106	44051	44054	the other young ladies	1132	” Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father ’s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . Others of the party were now applied to . “
44110	44115	44051	44054	the other young ladies	1132	” said Mr. Collins , “
44342	44994	44333	44333	his	1135	” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared -- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed , in a half - whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side ; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room . He assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . There was no arguing upon such a project . She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged Mr. Collins ’s conversation to herself . She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy ’s further notice : though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham , and rejoiced in it . The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation , and , by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins , who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . Darcy said nothing at all . Mr. Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “
45002	45228	44333	44333	his	1135	” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months . Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield .

45237	45352	44333	44333	his	1135	” ] CHAPTER XIX . [ Illustration ] The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . Mr. Collins made his declaration in form . Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words,-- “
45387	45404	45412	45412	I	0	” Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,-- “
45439	45455	45432	45432	Kitty	145	” And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out,-- “
45496	45497	45494	45494	myself	0	” “
45515	45536	45537	45537	Lizzy	120	” And upon Elizabeth ’s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , “
45551	45628	45539	45539	I	0	” Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction ; and a moment ’s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal , by incessant employment , the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- “
45792	45839	45840	45840	My	0	” The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued,-- “
46412	46422	46423	46423	You	3515	” It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . “
46430	46434	46423	46423	You	3515	” she cried . “
46489	46490	46491	46491	I	0	” “
46498	46511	46491	46491	I	0	” replied Mr. Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , “
46584	46585	46587	46587	my	0	” “
46592	46596	46587	46587	my	0	” cried Elizabeth , “
46713	46714	46700	46700	she	145	” “
46725	46731	46719	46720	Lady Catherine	145	” said Mr. Collins , very gravely--“but
46779	46780	46761	46761	I	0	” “
46891	46913	46923	46923	you	3457	” And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,-- “
47006	47007	46982	46982	you	3457	” “
47013	47021	47022	47022	you	116	” cried Elizabeth , with some warmth , “
47064	47065	47066	47066	You	3457	” “
47255	47256	47257	47257	I	0	” “
47359	47360	47356	47356	her	1192	” “
47366	47377	47361	47361	You	0	” cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; “
47405	47675	47681	47682	Mr. Collins	116	” To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XX . [ Illustration ] Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs. Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . This information , however , startled Mrs. Bennet : she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so . “
47684	47688	47681	47682	Mr. Collins	116	” she added , “
47734	47735	47725	47725	I	0	” “
47744	47749	47725	47725	I	0	” cried Mr. Collins ; “
47831	47832	47833	47833	Sir	3457	” “
47840	47847	47835	47835	you	3457	” said Mrs. Bennet , alarmed . “
47895	47920	47891	47891	I	0	” She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out , as she entered the library,-- “
47976	48011	48012	48012	I	0	” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . “
48021	48032	48012	48012	I	0	” said he , when she had finished her speech . “
48039	48040	48036	48036	you	130	” “
48069	48070	48063	48063	he	116	” “
48087	48088	48094	48094	yourself	0	” “
48106	48107	48099	48099	you	0	” “
48120	48136	48114	48114	She	120	” Mrs. Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . “
48142	48150	48140	48140	child	1130	” cried her father as she appeared . “
48179	48186	48165	48166	Mr. Collins	116	” Elizabeth replied that it was . “
48199	48200	48201	48201	I	0	” “
48206	48207	48201	48201	I	0	” “
48234	48235	48231	48232	Mrs. Bennet	141	” “
48246	48247	48231	48232	Mrs. Bennet	141	” “
48301	48338	48341	48341	you	0	” Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs. Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . “
48365	48366	48353	48353	You	0	” “
48370	48375	48353	48353	You	0	” replied her husband , “
48426	48623	48624	48624	I	0	” Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs. Bennet give up the point . She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane , with all possible mildness , declined interfering ; and Elizabeth , sometimes with real earnestness , and sometimes with playful gaiety , replied to her attacks . Though her manner varied , however , her determination never did . Mr. Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , “
48663	48667	48668	48668	they	1212	” [ Illustration : “
48673	48746	48668	48668	they	1212	” ] Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs. Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family . “
48755	48764	48752	48753	Miss Lucas	174	” she added , in a melancholy tone ; “
48790	48804	48808	48808	she	1218	” Charlotte ’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . “
48811	48816	48808	48808	she	1218	” continued Mrs. Bennet , “
49021	49087	49090	49090	I	0	” Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation . She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls,-- “
49119	49201	49109	49110	Mr. Collins	116	” Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation:-- “
49207	49208	49109	49110	Mr. Collins	116	” “
49213	49217	49109	49110	Mr. Collins	116	” replied he , “
49234	49247	49232	49232	me	0	” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “
49484	49770	49771	49771	I	0	” [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XXI . [ Illustration ] The discussion of Mr. Collins ’s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . As for the gentleman himself , _ his _ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . He scarcely ever spoke to her ; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend . The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet ’s ill humour or ill health . Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton , to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . He joined them on their entering the town , and attended them to their aunt ’s , where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _ had _ been self - imposed . “
49774	49778	49771	49771	I	0	” said he , “
49830	49921	49925	49925	them	1241	” She highly approved his forbearance ; and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her . His accompanying them was a double advantage : she felt all the compliment it offered to herself ; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . [ Illustration : “
49926	50092	50140	50140	she	195	” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot - pressed paper , well covered with a lady ’s fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ’s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . Jane recollected herself soon ; and putting the letter away , tried to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs . When they had gained their own room , Jane , taking out her letter , said , “
50143	50193	50140	50140	she	195	” She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street , where Mr. Hurst had a house . The next was in these words:--“‘I
50262	50342	50254	50254	I	0	” To these high - flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley ’s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . “
50347	50356	50254	50254	I	0	” said she , after a short pause , “
50431	50432	50433	50433	Caroline	195	” “
50455	50624	50448	50448	I	0	“ ‘ When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . ’ “
50631	50635	50448	50448	I	0	” added Jane , “
50645	50646	50448	50448	I	0	” “
50662	50663	50652	50653	Miss Bingley	173	” “
50942	50951	50931	50931	you	1255	” said Jane , as she finished it . “
51022	51023	50998	50998	she	195	” “
51040	51041	51036	51036	you	1255	” “
51045	51046	51036	51036	you	1255	” “
51101	51107	51110	51110	Jane	181	” Jane shook her head . “
51328	51329	51331	51331	we	1279	” “
51338	51342	51343	51343	your	173	” replied Jane , “
51387	51388	51385	51385	herself	195	” “
51437	51438	51422	51422	You	173	” “
51471	51472	51473	51473	You	173	” “
51479	51483	51473	51473	You	173	” said Elizabeth ; “
51525	51526	51513	51513	I	0	” “
51533	51540	51541	51541	you	173	” said Jane , faintly smiling ; “
51562	51563	51557	51557	I	0	” “
51587	51588	51577	51577	I	0	” “
51614	51918	51932	51932	I	0	” The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline ’s interested wishes ; and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone . She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane ’s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart . They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ’s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together . After lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again , and soon dining at Longbourn ; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XXII . [ Illustration ] The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases ; and again , during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins . Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . “
51926	51930	51932	51932	I	0	” said she , “
51943	52425	51932	51932	I	0	” Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . This was very amiable ; but Charlotte ’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins ’s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . Such was Miss Lucas ’s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character ; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet . He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that , if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for , though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday . His reception , however , was of the most flattering kind . Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . In as short a time as Mr. Collins ’s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . Mr. Collins ’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . Lady Lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever [ Illustration : “
52431	52925	52926	52926	My	0	” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] excited before , how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James ’s . The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . The younger girls formed hopes of _ coming out _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ’s dying an old maid . Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . Her reflections were in general satisfactory . Mr. Collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable : his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object : it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and , however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation . She resolved to give her the information herself ; and therefore charged Mr. Collins , when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs. Bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . “
52930	52934	52926	52926	My	0	” he replied , “
52970	52994	52959	52959	I	0	” They were all astonished ; and Mr. Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said,-- “
53026	53027	53028	53028	My	0	” “
53032	53037	53028	53028	My	0	” replied Mr. Collins , “
53067	53068	53069	53069	You	1289	” “
53126	53127	53129	53129	me	0	” “
53217	53438	53215	53215	Elizabeth	120	” With proper civilities , the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others : there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her ; and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that , if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion . But on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away . Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . The possibility of Mr. Collins ’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two : but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself ; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out,-- “
53450	53497	53446	53446	Charlotte	154	” The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied,-- “
53539	53587	53509	53509	you	154	” But Elizabeth had now recollected herself ; and , making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her , with tolerable firmness , that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . “
53595	53599	53588	53588	I	0	” replied Charlotte ; “
53702	53706	53692	53693	most people	1301	” Elizabeth quietly answered “
53709	53889	53890	53890	Protested	161	” and , after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . Charlotte did not stay much longer ; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . The strangeness of Mr. Collins ’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . She had always felt that Charlotte ’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own ; but she could not have supposed it possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage . Charlotte , the wife of Mr. Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself , and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . [ Illustration : “
53897	54022	53891	53891	he	1302	” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] CHAPTER XXIII . [ Illustration ] Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed,-- “
54049	55384	54042	54043	Mr. Collins	116	” Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment : but Sir William ’s good - breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy . Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . Mrs. Bennet was , in fact , too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off . Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . Nothing could console and nothing appease her . Nor did that day wear out her resentment . A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her : a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude ; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . Mr. Bennet ’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match : but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet ’s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again . Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve - month ’s abode in the family might have prompted . After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . Mr. Collins ’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet . On the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley ’s continued absence . Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane ’s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters , and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . As for Jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ’s : but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ; and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used . It needed all Jane ’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and , luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . [ Illustration : “
55394	55532	55387	55387	she	1303	” ] Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill - humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . Whenever Charlotte came to see them , she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead . She complained bitterly of all this to her husband . “
55538	55542	55535	55536	Mr. Bennet	130	” said she , “
55586	55587	55588	55589	My dear	3261	” “
55620	55646	55647	55647	I	0	” This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet ; and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before . “
55675	55676	55669	55669	I	0	” “
55683	55684	55685	55685	I	0	” “

55781	56293	55777	55777	yourself	130	” said Mr. Bennet . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XXIV . [ Illustration ] Miss Bingley ’s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ’s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . Miss Darcy ’s praise occupied the chief of it . Her many attractions were again dwelt on ; and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ’s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy ’s house , and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . Her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others . To Caroline ’s assertion of her brother ’s being partial to Miss Darcy , she paid no credit . That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best ; but her sister ’s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . She could think of nothing else ; and yet , whether Bingley ’s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ’ interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ’s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ’s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last , on Mrs. Bennet ’s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying,-- “
56350	56364	56365	56365	You	1318	” Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . “
56369	56376	56379	56379	you	1318	” cried Jane , slightly colouring ; “
56443	56452	56453	56453	I	0	” With a stronger voice she soon added , “
56486	56487	56488	56488	My	0	” “
56492	56496	56488	56488	My	0	” exclaimed Elizabeth , “
56538	56559	56524	56524	I	0	” Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ’s warm affection . “
56562	56566	56573	56573	You	181	” said Elizabeth , “
56736	56737	56738	56738	My	0	” “
56830	56831	56834	56834	you	120	” “

57008	57012	56999	56999	your	181	” replied Jane ; “
57133	57134	57124	57124	Women	292	” “
57143	57144	57136	57136	men	291	” “
57176	57177	57178	57178	I	0	” “
57193	57197	57178	57178	I	0	” said Elizabeth ; “
57243	57244	57247	57247	you	0	” “
57255	57256	57247	57247	you	0	” “

57399	57400	57404	57404	they	479	” “
57413	57417	57410	57411	Miss Darcy	152	” replied Jane ; “
57597	57752	57579	57579	me	0	” Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr. Bingley ’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more ; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . Mrs. Bennet ’s best comfort was , that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer . Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently . “
57757	57764	57755	57755	Lizzy	120	” said he , one day , “
57873	57874	57861	57861	He	113	” “
57899	57900	57894	57894	Jane	181	” “
57903	57908	57894	57894	Jane	181	” said Mr. Bennet ; “
57940	58459	58460	58460	I	0	” Mr. Wickham ’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter . Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . [ Illustration ] CHAPTER XXV . [ Illustration ] After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . On the following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . Mr. Gardiner was a sensible , gentlemanlike man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well - bred and agreeable . Mrs. Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces . Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . They had frequently been staying with her in town . The first part of Mrs. Gardiner ’s business , on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . When this was done , she had a less active part to play . It became her turn to listen . Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister . Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . “
58466	58470	58460	58460	I	0	” she continued , “
58655	58715	58648	58648	you	1357	” Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ’s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation . When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . “
58728	58732	58733	58733	I	0	” said she . “
58793	58797	58799	58803	two or three young ladies	1384	” [ Illustration : “

58824	58828	58799	58803	two or three young ladies	1384	” said Elizabeth ; “
58884	58885	58858	58863	a young man of independent fortune	1387	” “
58950	58951	58952	58952	I	0	” “
59033	59034	59045	59045	I	0	” “
59134	59153	59154	59154	I	0	” Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ’s ready acquiescence . “
59157	59162	59154	59154	I	0	” added Mrs. Gardiner , “
59225	59226	59236	59236	he	1394	” “
59331	59332	59324	59325	Mr. Bingley	115	” “
59367	59368	59369	59369	She	95	” “
59376	59929	59369	59369	She	95	” But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane ’s attractions . Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ’s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped , by Caroline ’s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth ’s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . To Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged . They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ’s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well . Here , consequently , was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy ’s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ’s reputed disposition , when quite a lad , which might agree with it ; and was confident , at last , that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy . [ Illustration : “
59937	59979	59931	59931	you	1404	” ] CHAPTER XXVI . [ Illustration ] Mrs. Gardiner ’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone : after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on:-- “
60140	60141	60142	60142	My	0	” “
60152	60153	60142	60144	My dear aunt	1400	” “

60209	60210	60211	60211	Elizabeth	120	” “
60219	60220	60213	60213	you	1400	” “
60479	60480	60473	60473	I	0	” “
60511	60512	60499	60499	you	1400	” “
60520	60529	60514	60514	I	0	” said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; “
60618	60731	60612	60612	I	0	” Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth , having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented . Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but , as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet . His marriage was now fast approaching ; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say , in an ill - natured tone , that she “
60740	60802	60612	60612	I	0	” Thursday was to be the wedding - day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said,-- “
60815	60816	60813	60813	Eliza	120	” “
60824	60825	60813	60813	Eliza	120	” “
60841	60842	60835	60835	you	0	” “
60854	60855	60856	60856	I	0	” “
60877	60892	60893	60893	My	0	” Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit . “
60905	60909	60911	60911	I	0	” added Charlotte , “
60938	61288	60924	60924	Eliza	120	” The wedding took place : the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . Elizabeth soon heard from her friend , and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been : that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over ; and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was . Charlotte ’s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness : there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ’s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . It was Mr. Collins ’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . Jane had already written a few lines to her sister , to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost . “
61292	61296	60924	60924	Eliza	120	” she continued , “
61321	61338	61339	61339	I	0	” She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . “
61347	61352	61339	61339	I	0	” were her words , “
61459	61593	61449	61449	I	0	” Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister ’s being in town . Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ’s inattention . After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “
62160	62165	62150	62150	I	0	“ Yours , etc . ”
62504	62705	62501	62501	she	201	on:--“I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . ”
62709	62713	62501	62501	she	201	“ On the Stairs ”
63538	63545	63546	63546	she	201	“ But , my dear Elizabeth , ”
63549	63568	63546	63546	she	201	“ what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ”
63569	63644	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ”
63645	63667	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ”
63668	63688	63546	63546	she	201	“ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . ”
63689	63710	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather ’s death made her mistress of this fortune ? ”
63711	63762	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ No -- why should he ? If it were not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? ”
63763	63780	63546	63546	she	201	“ But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . ”
63781	63817	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If _ she _ does not object to it , why should _ we _ ? ”
63818	63845	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ . It only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . ”
63846	63849	63851	63851	Elizabeth	120	“ Well , ”
63853	63875	63851	63851	Elizabeth	120	“ have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . ”
63876	63914	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ No , Lizzy , that is what I do _ not _ choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . ”
63915	64001	63851	63851	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . ”
64002	64015	63518	63519	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . ”
64054	64067	64069	64070	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , ”
64072	64080	64069	64070	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ but perhaps , to the Lakes . ”
64103	64110	64111	64111	she	120	“ My dear , dear aunt , ”
64115	64254	64111	64111	she	120	“ what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are men to rocks and mountains ? Oh , what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We _ will _ know where we have gone -- we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . Let _ our _ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . ”
64258	64262	64111	64111	she	120	“ At the door ”
65157	65302	65151	65152	Mr. Collins	116	“ Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her Ladyship ’s carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship ’s carriages , for she has several . ”
65303	65316	65318	65318	Charlotte	154	“ Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , ”
65320	65327	65318	65318	Charlotte	154	“ and a most attentive neighbour . ”
65328	65358	65151	65152	Mr. Collins	116	“ Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . ”
65554	65560	65536	65536	Maria	176	“ In Conversation with the ladies ”
65570	65616	65617	65617	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . ”
65665	65671	65673	65673	Elizabeth	120	“ And is this all ? ”
65675	65700	65673	65673	Elizabeth	120	“ I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! ”
65701	65707	65709	65709	Maria	176	“ La ! my dear , ”
65717	65767	65709	65709	Maria	176	“ it is not Lady Catherine . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them . The other is Miss De Bourgh . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! ”
65768	65791	65673	65673	Elizabeth	120	“ She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? ”
65792	65815	65709	65709	Maria	176	“ Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . ”
65816	65822	65824	65824	Elizabeth	120	“ I like her appearance , ”
65831	65857	65824	65824	Elizabeth	120	“ She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . ”
66087	66091	66093	66093	he	167	“ I confess , ”
66095	66180	66093	66093	he	167	“ that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? ”
66181	66192	66194	66195	Sir William	167	“ I am the less surprised at what has happened , ”
66197	66235	66194	66195	Sir William	167	“ from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . ”
66302	66385	66298	66298	he	116	“ Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . ”
67613	67631	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ Your father ’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ? For your sake , ”
67636	67679	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ’s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? ”
67680	67684	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ A little . ”
67685	67726	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? ”
67727	67733	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ One of them does . ”
67734	67771	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? ”
67772	67779	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ No , not at all . ”
67780	67787	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ What , none of you ? ”
67788	67792	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ Not one . ”
67793	67823	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . ”
67824	67838	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . ”
67839	67846	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ Has your governess left you ? ”
67847	67854	67609	67610	Lady Catherine	145	“ We never had any governess . ”
67855	67894	67902	67902	she	120	“ No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . ”
67912	67933	67902	67902	she	120	“ Then who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . ”
67934	67983	67902	67902	she	120	“ Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle certainly might . ”
67984	68170	67902	67902	she	120	“ Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . ‘ Lady Catherine , ’ said she , ‘ you have given me a treasure . ’ Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? ”
68171	68178	67902	67902	she	120	“ Yes , ma’am , all . ”
68179	68217	67902	67902	she	120	“ All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? ”
68218	68327	67902	67902	she	120	“ Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company . But really , ma’am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . And to be kept back on _ such _ a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . ”
68328	68333	68335	68336	her Ladyship	899	“ Upon my word , ”
68338	68358	68335	68336	her Ladyship	899	“ you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? ”
68359	68367	68369	68369	Elizabeth	120	“ With three younger sisters grown up , ”
68373	68384	68369	68369	Elizabeth	120	“ your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . ”
68418	68437	68400	68400	herself	120	“ You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . ”
68438	68448	68450	68451	the gentlemen	3277	“ I am not one - and - twenty . ”
69383	69390	69357	69357	she	120	“ he never failed to inform them ”
69778	69784	69790	69791	George Allen	94	“ The gentlemen accompanied him . ”
69921	69948	69949	69949	Elizabeth	120	“ I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . ”
70154	70175	70137	70137	She	120	“ My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? ”
70248	70251	70207	70207	she	120	“ At Church ”
70634	70666	70627	70627	she	899	“ What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . ”
70667	70676	70678	70678	he	142	“ We were talking of music , madam , ”
70689	70794	70795	70796	Mr. Darcy	142	“ Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? ”
70807	70821	70823	70824	Lady Catherine	145	“ I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , ”
70826	70851	70823	70824	Lady Catherine	145	“ and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . ”
70852	70859	70860	70860	he	142	“ I assure you , madam , ”
70863	70877	70860	70860	he	142	“ that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . ”
70878	71008	71009	71010	Mr. Darcy	142	“ So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson ’s room . She would be in nobody ’s way , you know , in that part of the house . ”
71138	71205	71115	71115	Elizabeth	120	“ You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ”
71206	71216	71217	71217	he	142	“ I shall not say that you are mistaken , ”
71220	71269	71217	71217	he	142	“ because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . ”
71285	71404	71270	71270	Elizabeth	120	“ Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . ”
71405	71413	71415	71415	he	1702	“ I am not afraid of you , ”
71419	71432	71434	71435	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , ”
71437	71449	71434	71435	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . ”
71450	71556	71270	71270	Elizabeth	120	“ You shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances ! I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . ”
71557	71578	71434	71435	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . ”
71579	71611	71270	71270	Elizabeth	120	“ True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . ”
71612	71615	71617	71617	Darcy	142	“ Perhaps , ”
71619	71643	71617	71617	Darcy	142	“ I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ”
71644	71655	71657	71657	Elizabeth	120	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ”
71664	71695	71661	71662	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? ”
71696	71703	71705	71705	Fitzwilliam	238	“ I can answer your question , ”
71707	71724	71705	71705	Fitzwilliam	238	“ without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . ”
71725	71737	71739	71739	Darcy	142	“ I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , ”
71741	71775	71739	71739	Darcy	142	“ of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . ”
71776	71780	71782	71782	Elizabeth	120	“ My fingers , ”
71784	71867	71782	71782	Elizabeth	120	“ do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women ’s do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman ’s of superior execution . ”
71873	71909	71868	71868	Darcy	142	“ You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . ”
71951	72010	71935	71936	Lady Catherine	145	“ Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne ’s . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ”
72353	72416	72351	72351	she	120	“ How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London ? ”
72417	72425	72426	72426	She	120	“ Perfectly so , I thank you . ”
72445	72465	72426	72426	She	120	“ I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? ”
72466	72513	72351	72351	she	120	“ I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ”
72514	72591	72426	72426	She	120	“ If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ”
72592	72599	72601	72601	Darcy	142	“ I should not be surprised , ”
72603	72619	72601	72601	Darcy	142	“ if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ”
72666	72694	72657	72657	He	1717	“ This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . ”
72695	72718	72601	72601	Darcy	142	“ I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ”
72719	72732	72601	72601	Darcy	142	“ Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ”
72733	72821	72657	72657	He	1717	“ Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however ; and , in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ”
72822	72845	72601	72601	Darcy	142	“ It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ”
72846	72861	72601	72601	Darcy	142	“ An easy distance do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . ”
72862	72891	72657	72657	He	1717	“ And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day ’s journey . Yes , I call it a very easy distance . ”
72892	72911	72913	72913	Elizabeth	120	“ I should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , ”
72915	72931	72913	72913	Elizabeth	120	“ I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _ near _ her family . ”
72932	72959	72961	72961	he	1719	“ It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . ”
72995	73103	73104	73105	Mr. Darcy	142	“ I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case _ here _ . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ the present distance . ”
73117	73144	73107	73107	his	142	“ _ You _ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . _ You _ can not have been always at Longbourn . ”
73182	73189	73157	73157	he	482	“ Are you pleased with Kent ? ”
73275	73280	73286	73287	George Allen	94	“ Accompanied by their aunt ”
73292	73301	73303	73303	Charlotte	154	“ What can be the meaning of this ? ”
73312	73338	73303	73303	Charlotte	154	“ My dear Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ”
73946	73950	73973	73974	Mr. Darcy	142	“ On looking up ”
74326	74339	74324	74324	she	120	“ I did not know before that you ever walked this way . ”
74340	74351	74352	74352	he	142	“ I have been making the tour of the park , ”
74355	74381	74352	74352	he	142	“ as I generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? ”
74382	74393	74324	74324	she	120	“ No , I should have turned in a moment . ”
74408	74417	74419	74419	she	120	“ Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? ”
74421	74449	74419	74419	she	120	“ Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . ”
74450	74495	74324	74324	she	120	“ And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . ”
74496	74507	74509	74510	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ He likes to have his own way very well , ”
74512	74566	74509	74510	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . ”
74567	74624	74324	74324	she	120	“ In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? ”
74625	74672	74324	74324	she	120	“ These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . ”
74673	74690	74509	74510	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . ”
74691	74722	74324	74324	she	120	“ Our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ”
74723	74727	74729	74729	Elizabeth	120	“ Is this , ”
74731	74736	74738	74738	she	120	“ meant for me ? ”
74755	74790	74747	74747	herself	120	“ And pray , what is the usual price of an earl ’s younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ”
74824	74893	74820	74820	she	120	“ I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ”
74894	74897	74899	74900	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ No , ”
74902	74926	74899	74900	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . ”
74927	74983	74990	74990	him	238	“ Are you , indeed ? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make ? Does your charge give you much trouble ? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ”
75034	75096	75031	75031	She	1751	“ You need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley . I think I have heard you say that you know them . ”
75097	75122	75031	75031	She	1751	“ I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy ’s . ”
75123	75127	75129	75129	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh yes , ”
75130	75150	75031	75031	She	1751	drily--“Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ”
75151	75228	75031	75031	She	1751	“ Care of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . It was all conjecture . ”
75229	75236	75031	75031	She	1751	“ What is it you mean ? ”
75237	75273	75031	75031	She	1751	“ It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ’s family it would be an unpleasant thing . ”
75274	75284	75031	75031	She	1751	“ You may depend upon my not mentioning it . ”
75285	75376	75031	75031	She	1751	“ And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ”
75377	75389	75031	75031	She	1751	“ Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ”
75390	75404	75031	75031	She	1751	“ I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ”
75405	75416	75031	75031	She	1751	“ And what arts did he use to separate them ? ”
75417	75429	75431	75431	Fitzwilliam	142	“ He did not talk to me of his own arts , ”
75435	75447	75431	75431	Fitzwilliam	142	“ He only told me what I have now told you . ”
75478	75490	75492	75492	she	120	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ”
75494	75513	75492	75492	she	120	“ Your cousin ’s conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? ”
75514	75525	75469	75469	Fitzwilliam	142	“ You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ”
75526	75574	75575	75575	she	120	“ I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ’s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . But , ”
75581	75613	75575	75575	she	120	“ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ”
75614	75622	75624	75624	Fitzwilliam	142	“ That is not an unnatural surmise , ”
75626	75641	75624	75624	Fitzwilliam	142	“ but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ’s triumph very sadly . ”
75871	75882	75884	75885	Colonel Fitzwilliam	238	“ There were some very strong objections against the lady , ”
75915	75920	75921	75921	she	120	“ To Jane herself , ”
75924	75987	75921	75921	she	120	“ there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is ! Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ”
76639	76673	76627	76627	he	142	“ In vain have I struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . ”
76978	77110	76976	76976	she	120	“ In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ”
77206	77255	77204	77204	he	142	“ And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . ”
77256	77263	77265	77265	she	120	“ I might as well inquire , ”
77267	77384	77265	77265	she	120	“ why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ”
77413	77503	77504	77504	She	120	“ I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there _ . You dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ”
77543	77553	77554	77554	she	120	“ Can you deny that you have done it ? ”
77564	77606	77560	77560	he	142	“ I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards _ him _ I have been kinder than towards myself . ”
77632	77641	77642	77642	she	120	“ But it is not merely this affair , ”
77645	77718	77642	77642	she	120	“ on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? ”
77719	77731	77733	77733	Darcy	142	“ You take an eager interest in that gentleman ’s concerns , ”
77747	77764	77733	77733	Darcy	142	“ Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him ? ”
77765	77769	77771	77771	Darcy	142	“ His misfortunes ! ”
77773	77782	77771	77771	Darcy	142	contemptuously,--“yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ”
77783	77789	77791	77791	Elizabeth	120	“ And of your infliction , ”
77796	77870	77791	77791	Elizabeth	120	“ You have reduced him to his present state of poverty -- comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ”
77871	77875	77877	77877	Darcy	142	“ And this , ”
77889	77931	77933	77933	he	142	“ is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But , perhaps , ”
77945	78075	77933	77933	he	142	“ these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ”
78098	78146	78096	78096	she	120	“ You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ”
78162	78187	78160	78160	she	120	“ You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ”
78211	78309	78208	78208	She	120	“ From the very beginning , from the first moment , I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . ”
78310	78362	78367	78367	he	1781	“ You have said quite enough , madam . I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ”
78635	78639	78607	78608	Lady Catherine	145	“ Hearing herself called ”
78971	79000	78958	78958	she	120	“ I have been walking in the grove some time , in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ”
79102	79240	79080	79080	she	120	“ Be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . “
82058	82062	82049	82049	I	0	“ FITZWILLIAM DARCY . ”
82403	82419	82393	82393	She	120	“ This must be false ! This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and
82892	82897	82887	82887	he	142	“ Meeting accidentally in Town ”
83733	83740	83741	83741	she	120	“ How despicably have I acted ! ”
83744	83874	83741	83741	she	120	“ I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind . But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away where either were concerned . Till this moment , I never knew myself . ”
84384	84388	84373	84373	She	120	“ His parting obeisance ”
84561	84574	84580	84580	she	120	“ What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? ”
84596	84606	84608	84609	Lady Catherine	145	“ I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , ”
84611	84697	84608	84609	Lady Catherine	145	“ I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are . The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . ”
84760	84798	84758	84758	she	145	“ But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ”
84799	84812	84814	84814	Elizabeth	120	“ I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , ”
84816	84836	84814	84814	Elizabeth	120	“ but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . ”
84837	84891	84758	84758	she	145	“ Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . ”
84892	84908	84758	84758	she	145	“ But my father can not . He wrote last week to hurry my return . ”
84912	84914	84758	84758	she	145	“ Dawson ”
84926	85048	84758	84758	she	145	“ Oh , your father , of course , may spare you , if your mother can . Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ”
85049	85068	85069	85070	Lady Catherine	145	“ You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . ”
85074	85252	85069	85070	Lady Catherine	145	“ Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . ”
85253	85264	85069	85070	Lady Catherine	145	“ My uncle is to send a servant for us . ”
85265	85322	85069	85070	Lady Catherine	145	“ Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man - servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . Where shall you change horses ? Oh , Bromley , of course . If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . ”
86032	86039	86024	86024	her	153	“ The elevation of his feelings . ”
86081	86089	86091	86091	he	116	“ I know not , Miss Elizabeth , ”
86093	86220	86091	86091	he	116	“ whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . ”
86278	86437	86266	86267	Mr. Collins	116	“ It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ’s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth , I must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . ”
86472	86620	86459	86459	Elizabeth	120	“ You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself , at least , that you will be able to do so . Lady Catherine ’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . ”
86888	86896	86861	86861	he	116	“ They had forgotten to leave any message ”
86898	86901	86902	86902	he	116	“ But , ”
86905	86935	86902	86902	he	116	“ you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . ”
86956	86960	86962	86962	Maria	176	“ Good gracious ! ”
86971	86992	86962	86962	Maria	176	“ it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! ”
86993	86999	87001	87002	her companion	1971	“ A great many indeed , ”
87008	87031	87032	87032	Elizabeth	120	“ We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! ”
87036	87046	87032	87032	Elizabeth	120	“ And how much I shall have to conceal ! ”
87265	87272	87234	87234	her	120	“ How nicely we are crammed in ”
87411	87424	87391	87391	they	681	“ Is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? ”
87425	87434	87436	87436	Lydia	181	“ And we mean to treat you all , ”
87438	87459	87436	87436	Lydia	181	“ but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . ”
87463	87517	87527	87527	she	181	purchases,--“Look here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . ”
87534	87601	87527	87527	she	181	“ Oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . ”
87602	87608	87610	87610	Elizabeth	120	“ Are they , indeed ? ”
87617	87684	87610	87610	Elizabeth	120	“ They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . Mamma would like to go , too , of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! ”
87685	87688	87690	87690	Elizabeth	120	“ Yes , ”
87692	87745	87690	87690	Elizabeth	120	“ _ that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton ! ”
87746	87756	87758	87758	Lydia	181	“ Now I have got some news for you , ”
87767	87791	87758	87758	Lydia	181	“ What do you think ? It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . ”
87816	87940	87811	87811	Lydia	181	“ Ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? There is no danger of Wickham ’s marrying Mary King -- there ’s for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay . Wickham is safe . ”
87941	87948	87950	87950	Elizabeth	120	“ And Mary King is safe ! ”
87952	87962	87950	87950	Elizabeth	120	“ safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . ”
87963	87978	87811	87811	Lydia	181	“ She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . ”
87979	87992	87994	87994	Jane	181	“ But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , ”
87996	88034	87994	87994	Jane	181	“ I am sure there is not on _ his _ . I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . Who _ could _ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? ”
88129	88137	88139	88139	Lydia	181	“ How nicely we are crammed in ! ”
88141	88570	88139	88139	Lydia	181	“ I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three - and - twenty ! Lord ! how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you ca n’t think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ! and then I would _ chaperon _ you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ’s ! Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come : but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman ’s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And _ that _ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . ”
88656	88667	88668	88668	Their	1998	“ I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . ”
88791	88796	88798	88798	she	141	“ Oh , Mary , ”
88800	88957	88798	88798	she	141	“ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! ”
88966	89014	88961	88961	Mary	105	“ Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ . I should infinitely prefer a book . ”
89394	89404	89406	89406	she	120	“ His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , ”
89408	89427	89406	89406	she	120	“ and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . ”
89428	89431	89433	89433	Elizabeth	120	“ Indeed , ”
89435	89471	89433	89433	Elizabeth	120	“ I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ”
89472	89480	89406	89406	she	120	“ Blame you ! Oh , no . ”
89481	89494	89406	89406	she	120	“ But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? ”
89495	89512	89433	89433	Elizabeth	120	“ No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . ”
89513	89534	89535	89535	She	120	“ But you _ will _ know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . ”
89637	89643	89645	89645	Elizabeth	120	“ This will not do , ”
89647	89730	89645	89645	Elizabeth	120	“ you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy ’s , but you shall do as you choose . ”
89747	89759	89761	89761	she	120	“ I do not know when I have been more shocked , ”
89763	89831	89761	89761	she	120	“ Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing , I am sure you must feel it so . ”
89832	89898	89617	89617	she	120	“ Oh no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . ”
89899	89923	89617	89617	she	120	“ Poor Wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner . ”
89924	89956	89761	89761	she	120	“ There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . ”
89957	89978	89617	89617	she	120	“ I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to do . ”
89979	90054	89617	89617	she	120	“ And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one ’s genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ”
90055	90079	89761	89761	she	120	“ Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ”
90080	90150	89617	89617	she	120	“ Indeed , I could not . I was uncomfortable enough , I was very uncomfortable -- I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me , and say that I had not been so very weak , and vain , and nonsensical , as I knew I had ! Oh , how I wanted you ! ”
90151	90181	89617	89617	she	120	“ How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly undeserved . ”
90182	90240	89761	89761	she	120	“ Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ’s character . ”
90251	90270	90241	90242	Miss Bennet	120	“ Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your own opinion ? ”
90271	90430	89617	89617	she	120	“ That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . Some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . ”
90431	90478	89761	89761	she	120	“ You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . ”
90608	90612	90614	90614	she	120	“ And then , ”
90616	90662	90614	90614	she	120	“ if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ”
90791	90796	90798	90799	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Well , Lizzy , ”
90804	90920	90798	90799	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane ’s ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Philips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . ”

90952	91028	90922	90922	Illustration	214	“ Oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come ; though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and , if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ”
91045	91050	91040	91040	she	120	“ Well , Lizzy , ”
91058	91129	91052	91053	her mother	439	“ and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? Well , well , I only hope it will last . And what sort of table do they keep ? Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say . If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . There is nothing extravagant in _ their _ housekeeping , I dare say . ”
91130	91137	90922	90922	Illustration	214	“ No , nothing at all . ”
91138	91220	91052	91053	her mother	439	“ A great deal of good management , depend upon it . Yes , yes . _ They _ will take care not to outrun their income . _ They _ will never be distressed for money . Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . ”
91221	91234	91052	91053	her mother	439	“ It was a subject which they could not mention before me . ”
91235	91298	90922	90922	Illustration	214	“ No ; it would have been strange if they had . But I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . _ I _ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . ”

91871	91906	91869	91869	she	145	“ though I am _ not _ her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . ”
92059	92101	92051	92051	He	442	“ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ”

92112	92157	92110	92110	Elizabeth	120	“ of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ’s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ”
92158	92162	92164	92165	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Already arisen ! ”
92167	92231	92164	92165	Mr. Bennet	130	“ What ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ’s folly . ”
92232	92488	92489	92490	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Indeed , you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ’s character . Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? ”
92512	92686	92489	92490	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go , then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ”

93380	93387	93356	93356	he	113	“ And you saw him frequently ? ”
93388	93395	93356	93356	he	113	“ Yes , almost every day . ”

93408	93423	93451	93451	he	113	“ Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . ”
93424	93427	93429	93429	Wickham	113	“ Indeed ! ”
93440	93446	93451	93451	he	113	“ And pray may I ask-- ”
93459	93487	93488	93488	he	113	“ Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ? for I dare not hope , ”
93499	93507	93488	93488	he	113	“ that he is improved in essentials . ”
93508	93513	93515	93515	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , no ! ”
93517	93533	93515	93515	Elizabeth	120	“ In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . ”
93577	93618	93575	93575	she	120	“ When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . ”
93660	93822	93647	93647	he	113	“ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . ”
94712	94718	94720	94720	she	120	“ But it is fortunate , ”
94722	94803	94720	94720	she	120	“ that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ’s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . ”
95396	95400	95402	95402	she	120	“ But surely , ”
95404	95427	95402	95402	she	120	“ I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars , without his perceiving me . ”
95783	95803	95805	95806	her aunt	4249	“ My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? ”
95808	95834	95805	95806	her aunt	4249	“ A place , too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . ”

97065	97091	97055	97056	Mrs. Reynolds	252	“ is my master -- and very like him . It was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . ”

97191	97197	97165	97165	Elizabeth	120	“ Yes , very handsome . ”
97198	97257	97165	97165	Elizabeth	120	“ I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master ’s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . ”
97291	97302	97304	97305	Mr. Gardiner	226	“ And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? ”
97307	97362	97304	97305	Mr. Gardiner	226	“ Oh , yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master : she comes here to - morrow with him . ”
97404	97418	97382	97383	Mrs. Reynolds	252	“ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ”
97419	97453	97363	97364	Mr. Gardiner	226	“ Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . ”

97484	97512	97513	97513	Mr.	2215	“ Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . ”
97525	97544	97519	97519	Elizabeth	120	“ It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . ”
97545	97563	97565	97566	the other	3653	“ I say no more than the truth , and what everybody will say that knows him , ”
97587	97614	97583	97584	the housekeeper	3875	“ I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . ”
97665	97688	97661	97662	her uncle	780	“ There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . ”
97689	97758	97759	97759	Elizabeth	120	“ Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . ”
97765	97772	97774	97774	she	120	“ Can this be Mr. Darcy ? ”
97776	97784	97786	97787	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ His father was an excellent man , ”
97789	97815	97786	97787	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ Yes , ma’am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . ”
97911	97923	97925	97925	she	120	“ He is the best landlord , and the best master , ”
97927	98004	97925	97925	she	120	“ that ever lived . Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . ”
98005	98016	98018	98018	Elizabeth	120	“ In what an amiable light does this place him ! ”
98020	98027	98029	98030	her aunt	4249	“ This fine account of him , ”
98035	98048	98029	98030	her aunt	4249	“ is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . ”
98049	98056	98029	98030	her aunt	4249	“ Perhaps we might be deceived . ”
98057	98070	98029	98030	her aunt	4249	“ That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . ”
98132	98140	98142	98142	Elizabeth	120	“ He is certainly a good brother , ”
98168	98178	98179	98179	she	252	“ And this is always the way with him , ”
98182	98210	98179	98179	she	252	“ Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . There is nothing he would not do for her . ”
100063	100066	100042	100042	she	120	“ delightful , ”
100068	100071	100042	100042	she	120	“ charming , ”
100179	100186	100188	100188	she	120	“ What will be his surprise , ”
100190	100207	100188	100188	she	120	“ when he knows who they are ! He takes them now for people of fashion . ”
100486	100547	100483	100483	she	120	“ Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for _ me _ , it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . ”
100687	100691	100692	100692	she	791	unexpected--“for your housekeeper , ”
100695	100731	100692	100692	she	791	“ informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and , indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ”
100768	100778	100779	100779	he	453	“ They will join me early to - morrow , ”
100782	100801	100779	100779	he	453	“ and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr . Bingley and his sisters . ”
100850	100861	100862	100862	he	453	“ There is also one other person in the party , ”
100868	100904	100862	100862	he	453	“ who more particularly wishes to be known to you . Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? ”
101249	101262	101264	101265	her uncle	780	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ”
101267	101283	101264	101265	her uncle	780	“ There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ”
101288	101328	101264	101265	her uncle	780	“ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _ I _ have seen nothing of it . ”
101329	101370	101380	101381	her aunt	4249	“ I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . ”
101371	101378	101380	101381	her aunt	4249	“ To be sure , Lizzy , ”
101383	101421	101380	101381	her aunt	4249	“ he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ’s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ”
101459	101472	101474	101475	her uncle	780	“ But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , ”
101477	101513	101474	101475	her uncle	780	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ”
101528	101537	101539	101540	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ From what we have seen of him , ”
101542	101671	101539	101540	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . ”
102822	102829	102835	102836	George Allen	94	“ To make herself agreeable to all ”
103052	103068	103076	103076	he	115	“ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ”
103079	103105	103076	103076	he	115	“ It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . ”
104661	104666	104680	104681	Miss Bingley	173	“ Engaged by the river ”
105590	105617	105622	105622	she	120	“ Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . ”
106123	106136	106137	106137	she	173	“ How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , ”
106140	106180	106137	106137	she	173	“ I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ”
106218	106224	106225	106225	she	173	“ For my own part , ”
106228	106347	106225	106225	she	173	“ I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ”
106413	106495	106411	106411	she	173	“ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ”
106496	106499	106501	106501	Darcy	142	“ Yes , ”
106510	106543	106501	106501	Darcy	142	“ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ”
106875	107202	107214	107214	she	2512	“ Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . ”
107255	108034	108047	108047	Elizabeth	120	“ By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia ’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. , intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney - coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success,--no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. ; but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ’s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage : he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such an exigence my uncle ’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . ”
108035	108045	108047	108047	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? ”
108131	108166	108114	108114	she	120	“ I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . ”
108167	108176	108178	108178	he	2513	“ Good God ! what is the matter ? ”
108190	108227	108188	108188	himself	2513	“ I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . ”
108330	108365	108418	108418	she	120	“ Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . ”
108366	108373	108374	108374	she	120	“ No , I thank you , ”
108382	108412	108418	108418	she	120	“ There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . ”
108450	108458	108434	108434	Darcy	142	“ I have not an instant to lose ”
108475	108563	108471	108471	she	120	“ I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . _ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . ”
108570	108575	108576	108576	she	120	“ When I consider , ”
108586	108649	108576	108576	she	120	“ that _ I _ might have prevented it ! _ I _ who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all , all too late now . ”
108650	108657	108659	108659	Darcy	142	“ I am grieved , indeed , ”
108661	108674	108576	108576	she	120	“ grieved -- shocked . But is it certain , absolutely certain ? ”
108675	108707	108576	108576	she	120	“ Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond : they are certainly not gone to Scotland . ”
108708	108724	108576	108576	she	120	“ And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? ”
108725	108806	108807	108807	Darcy	142	“ My father has gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ’s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! ”
108815	108861	108809	108809	his	142	“ When _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character , oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! ”
109091	109189	109071	109072	her companion	1971	“ I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress ! But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . ”
109190	109235	109236	109236	He	2525	“ Oh , yes ! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it can not be long . ”
110013	110023	110025	110026	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ But what is to be done about Pemberley ? ”
110028	110044	110025	110026	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? ”
110045	110069	110078	110079	the other	3653	“ Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _ That _ is all settled . ”
110070	110076	110078	110079	the other	3653	“ What is all settled ? ”
110090	110115	110082	110082	she	3653	“ And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? Oh , that I knew how it was ! ”
110280	110288	110589	110590	Mr. Gardiner	226	“ The first pleasing earnest of their welcome ”
110296	110307	110313	110313	they	2551	“ I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , ”
110319	110434	110313	110313	they	2551	“ and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his Colonel ’s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk . ”
110435	110442	110444	110444	Elizabeth	120	“ Do you really think so ? ”
110452	110457	110459	110460	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ Upon my word , ”
110462	110527	110459	110460	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ I begin to be of your uncle ’s opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ”
110528	110580	110313	110313	they	2551	“ Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? ”
110581	110587	110589	110590	Mr. Gardiner	226	“ In the first place , ”
110592	110606	110589	110590	Mr. Gardiner	226	“ there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . ”
110607	110642	110313	110313	they	2551	“ Oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . ”
110643	110709	110589	110590	Mr. Gardiner	226	“ Well , then,--supposing them to be in London -- they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . ”
110710	110939	110313	110313	they	2551	“ But why all this secrecy ? Why any fear of detection ? Why must their marriage be private ? Oh , no , no -- this is not likely . His most particular friend , you see by Jane ’s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . He can not afford it . And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ’s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ”
110940	110971	110313	110313	they	2551	“ But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ”
110972	110985	110987	110987	Elizabeth	120	“ It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ”
110995	111182	110987	110987	Elizabeth	120	“ that a sister ’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . ”
111183	111190	111192	111193	her aunt	4249	“ But you see that Jane , ”
111195	111213	111192	111193	her aunt	4249	“ does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . ”
111214	111302	110987	110987	Elizabeth	120	“ Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . ”
111303	111312	111314	111315	Mrs. Gardiner	201	“ And do you really know all this ? ”
111330	111336	111338	111338	Elizabeth	120	“ I do , indeed , ”
111342	111465	111338	111338	Elizabeth	120	“ I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . ”
111466	111490	110987	110987	Elizabeth	120	“ But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ”
111491	111674	110987	110987	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ’s time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . ”
111675	111701	111338	111338	Elizabeth	120	“ When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? ”
111702	111836	110987	110987	Elizabeth	120	“ Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . ”
112096	112100	112102	112102	Jane	181	“ Not yet , ”
112104	112121	112102	112102	Jane	181	“ But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . ”
112122	112129	112068	112068	she	120	“ Is my father in town ? ”
112130	112144	112068	112068	she	120	“ Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . ”
112145	112154	112102	112102	Jane	181	“ And have you heard from him often ? ”
112155	112215	112068	112068	she	120	“ We have heard only once . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . ”
112216	112230	112068	112068	she	120	“ And my mother -- how is she ? How are you all ? ”
112231	112283	112068	112068	she	120	“ My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . ”
112284	112292	112294	112294	Elizabeth	120	“ But you -- how are you ? ”
112296	112309	112294	112294	Elizabeth	120	“ You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! ”
112548	112555	112557	112557	she	141	“ If I had been able , ”
112559	112746	112557	112557	she	141	“ to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . Poor , dear child ! And now here ’s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ”
112798	112807	112809	112809	he	226	“ Do not give way to useless alarm , ”
112811	112927	112809	112809	he	226	“ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more , we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ”
112928	112935	112937	112938	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Oh , my dear brother , ”
112940	113139	112937	112938	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . ”
113420	113460	113470	113470	she	105	“ This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ”
113473	113542	113470	113470	she	105	“ Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ”
113661	113709	113653	113654	the former	375	“ But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . What did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . ”
113710	113796	113653	113654	the former	375	“ Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ’s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him . His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . ”
113797	113825	113653	113654	the former	375	“ And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? ”
113826	113883	113653	113654	the former	375	“ Yes ; but when questioned by _ him _ , Denny denied knowing anything of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from _ that _ I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before . ”
113884	113909	113653	113654	the former	375	“ And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? ”
113910	114027	113653	113654	the former	375	“ How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister ’s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks . ”
114028	114037	113653	113654	the former	375	“ But not before they went to Brighton ? ”
114038	114045	113653	113654	the former	375	“ No , I believe not . ”
114046	114066	113653	113654	the former	375	“ And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? ”
114067	114122	113653	113654	the former	375	“ I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . ”
114123	114149	113653	113654	the former	375	“ Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! ”
114150	114158	114160	114161	her sister	525	“ Perhaps it would have been better , ”
114163	114185	114160	114161	her sister	525	“ But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . ”
114186	114194	113653	113654	the former	375	“ We acted with the best intentions . ”
114195	114210	113653	113654	the former	375	“ Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ’s note to his wife ? ”
114211	114222	114160	114161	her sister	525	“ He brought it with him for us to see . ”

[ Illustration ] The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . His family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion . They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of _ that _ they would have been glad to be certain . Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on ; and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ’s not being killed in a duel . Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces . She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom . Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up -- though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham ’s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them . All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ’s family . Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ’s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when , if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him : it told them , that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street . That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure ; but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . He added , that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . There was also a postscript to this effect:-- “
115951	116201	115935	115935	Lizzy	120	” Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved . She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ’s impatience . Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated ; and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr. Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . It was as follows:-- / * “
116208	116388	116204	116204	Sir	3457	“ I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent ’s mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your [ Illustration : “
116396	116633	116634	116634	I	0	” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . “
116640	116867	116634	116634	I	0	” etc . , etc . Mr. Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . There was no one , therefore , who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him . And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ’s relations ; for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount . Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton . He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . “
116871	116875	116868	116869	A gamester	2656	” she cried . “
116889	116997	116881	116881	I	0	” Mr. Gardiner added , in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . Rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law ’s entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . When Mrs. Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . “
117010	117014	117025	117025	them	2659	” she cried . “
117044	117367	117395	117395	You	0	” As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it . The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _ that_,--though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ’s infamy somewhat better . It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two . When Mr. Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away ; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , “
117393	117394	117387	117387	I	0	” “

[ Illustration ] Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “

118033	118095	118018	118018	He	2676	” Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast - room ; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said,-- “
118114	118194	118106	118106	he	2676	” Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out,-- “

118949	118956	118958	118958	Jane	181	“ Let me write for you , ”
118960	118968	118958	118958	Jane	181	“ if you dislike the trouble yourself . ”

119004	119011	119013	119013	Elizabeth	120	“ And -- may I ask ? ”
119015	119028	119013	119013	Elizabeth	120	“ but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . ”
119029	119043	118958	118958	Jane	181	“ Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . ”
119044	119061	119013	119013	Elizabeth	120	“ And they _ must _ marry ! Yet he is _ such _ a man . ”
119062	119118	119013	119013	Elizabeth	120	“ Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . ”
119119	119125	119127	119127	Jane	181	“ Money ! my uncle ! ”
119129	119137	119127	119127	Jane	181	“ what do you mean , sir ? ”
119138	119172	119013	119013	Elizabeth	120	“ I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . ”
119173	119179	119181	119181	Elizabeth	120	“ That is very true , ”
119183	119237	119181	119181	Elizabeth	120	“ though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh , it must be my uncle ’s doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . ”
119238	119241	119243	119244	her father	442	“ No , ”
119246	119283	119243	119244	her father	442	“ Wickham ’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . ”
119284	119302	119303	119304	Mr. Bennet	130	“ Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? ”
119346	119355	119357	119357	Elizabeth	120	“ And they are really to be married ! ”
119367	119414	119357	119357	Elizabeth	120	“ How strange this is ! and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! ”
119415	119422	119424	119424	Jane	181	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ”
119426	119495	119424	119424	Jane	181	“ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? ”
119496	119511	119513	119513	Elizabeth	120	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ”
119515	119631	119513	119513	Elizabeth	120	“ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! ”
119632	119646	119648	119648	Jane	181	“ We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , ”
119650	119720	119648	119648	Jane	181	“ I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . ”
119721	119728	119730	119730	Elizabeth	120	“ Their conduct has been such , ”
119732	119755	119730	119730	Elizabeth	120	“ as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . ”

119835	119845	119846	119846	Elizabeth	120	“ Take whatever you like , and get away . ”
119984	119991	119992	119992	she	181	“ My dear , dear Lydia ! ”
119995	120137	119992	119992	she	181	“ this is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! ”
120170	120179	120180	120180	she	2711	“ For we must attribute this happy conclusion , ”
120183	120207	120180	120180	she	2711	“ in a great measure to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . ”
120208	120211	120213	120214	her mother	439	“ Well , ”
120216	120360	120213	120214	her mother	439	“ it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy . In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds ! And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n’t write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . ”
120448	120455	120457	120457	she	181	“ I will go to Meryton , ”
120459	120571	120457	120457	she	181	“ as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! here comes Hill . My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . ”

121606	121612	121614	121614	she	141	“ Haye Park might do , ”
121616	121669	121614	121614	she	141	“ if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off . I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . ”
121695	121753	121690	121690	he	453	“ Mrs. Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the imprudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . ”
122530	122542	122543	122543	he	226	“ It was greatly my wish that he should do so , ”
122546	122844	122543	122543	he	226	“ as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ’s . It is Mr. Wickham ’s intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- ’s regiment , now quartered in the north . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours , etc . “
122848	122957	122543	122543	he	226	” Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ’s removal from the ----shire , as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do . But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it . Lydia ’s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites . “
122966	122970	122958	122958	She	2786	” said she , “
123010	123238	122998	122999	The officers	651	” His daughter ’s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ’s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that , as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme ; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .

123243	123803	122998	122999	The officers	651	” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] CHAPTER LI . [ Illustration ] Their sister ’s wedding - day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . The carriage was sent to meet them at---- , and they were to return in it by dinnertime . Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets -- and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . They came . The family were assembled in the breakfast - room to receive them . Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . Lydia ’s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness . Their reception from Mr. Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . His countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips . The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . Lydia was Lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself ; but his manners were always so pleasing , that , had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . _ She _ blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour . There was no want of discourse . The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good - humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . “
123812	123816	122998	122999	The officers	651	” she cried , “
123881	123918	123921	123921	mamma	3328	” Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- “
124005	124073	123998	123998	I	0	” Elizabeth could bear it no longer . She got up and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour . She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ’s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- “
124097	124150	124093	124095	a married woman	2794	” It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first . Her ease and good spirits increased . She longed to see Mrs. Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called “
124153	124184	124151	124152	Mrs. Wickham	269	” by each of them ; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids . “
124189	124204	124187	124187	mamma	3328	” said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast - room , “
124271	124272	124263	124263	mamma	3328	” “
124309	124310	124313	124313	Lord	2802	” “
124378	124379	124366	124366	I	0	” “
124387	124392	124380	124380	I	0	” said her mother . “
124428	124429	124413	124413	I	0	” “
124440	124444	124430	124430	I	0	” said Elizabeth ; “
124457	124755	124756	124756	Lizzy	120	” Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not . Wickham ’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ’s for him . She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . He did everything best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country . One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth,-- “
124802	124803	124793	124793	you	120	” “
124808	124812	124793	124793	you	120	” replied Elizabeth ; “
124826	124827	124813	124813	I	0	” “
124902	125009	124892	124893	the others	712	“ Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . “
125108	125248	125255	125255	Elizabeth	120	“ Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ’ time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . ”
125249	125253	125255	125255	Elizabeth	120	“ Mr. Darcy ! ”
125261	125316	125255	125255	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But , gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! ”
125317	125326	125328	125328	Jane	181	“ If it was to be a secret , ”
125330	125348	125328	125328	Jane	181	“ say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . ”
125349	125354	125356	125356	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , certainly , ”
125363	125371	125356	125356	Elizabeth	120	“ we will ask you no questions . ”
125372	125376	125378	125378	Lydia	181	“ Thank you , ”
125380	125401	125378	125378	Lydia	181	“ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ”
125570	125576	125577	125577	she	120	“ You may readily comprehend , ”
125580	125660	125577	125577	she	120	“ what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ”
125661	125671	125672	125672	she	120	“ Not that I _ shall _ , though , ”
125683	125715	125678	125678	she	120	“ and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ”
125764	125773	125758	125759	a confidante	2827	“ I am sure she did not listen . ”
125858	125869	125870	125870	My	0	“ Gracechurch Street , _ Sept. 6 _ . * / “
125874	127946	127947	127947	Yours	2830	“ I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you . I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _ you _ . Do n’t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . Your uncle is as much surprised as I am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . Mr. Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been . He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both -- Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . She then took a large house in Edward Street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . Wickham , indeed , had gone to her on their first arrival in London ; and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . They were in ---- Street . He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance as far as it would go . But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham . She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design . He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia ’s flight on her own folly alone . He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . Wickham , of course , wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . Everything being settled between _ them _ , Mr. Darcy ’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home . But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen ; and Mr. Darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . He did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . On Saturday he came again . Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . They met again on Sunday , and then _ I _ saw him too . It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . But our visitor was very obstinate . I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _ this _ is the true one . Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . But , Lizzy , this must go no further than yourself , or Jane at most . You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased . The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . It was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ’s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . Perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though I doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody ’s _ reserve can be answerable for the event . But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . I believe I have now told you everything . It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . Lydia came to us , and Wickham had constant admission to the house . _ He _ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she stayed with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ’s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain . I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . I was sometimes quite provoked ; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and , as Lydia imformed you , attended the wedding . He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him ? His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . But slyness seems the fashion . Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . A low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing . But I must write no more . The children have been wanting me this half hour . “
127952	127956	127947	127947	Yours	2830	“ M. GARDINER . ”
128523	128537	128539	128539	he	113	“ I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ”
128546	128551	128552	128552	she	120	“ You certainly do , ”
128558	128571	128552	128552	she	120	“ but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . ”
128572	128598	128542	128542	he	113	“ I should be sorry , indeed , if it were . _ We _ were always good friends , and now we are better . ”
128599	128608	128552	128552	she	120	“ True . Are the others coming out ? ”
128609	128650	128651	128651	She	120	“ I do not know . Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . ”
128657	128722	128651	128651	She	120	“ I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . But of course she did not mention my name to you . ”
128723	128729	128789	128789	she	120	“ Yes , she did . ”
128730	128737	128789	128789	she	120	“ And what did she say ? ”
128738	128775	128651	128651	She	120	“ That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . At such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . ”
128776	128779	128784	128784	his	2844	“ Certainly , ”
128799	128827	128795	128795	he	2844	“ I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . We passed each other several times . I wonder what he can be doing there . ”
128828	128839	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , ”
128843	128859	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ It must be something particular to take him there at this time of year . ”
128860	128884	128795	128795	he	2844	“ Undoubtedly . Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . ”
128885	128895	128789	128789	she	120	“ Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . ”
128896	128903	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ And do you like her ? ”
128904	128908	128795	128795	he	2844	“ Very much . ”
128909	128955	128789	128789	she	120	“ I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . When I last saw her , she was not very promising . I am very glad you liked her . I hope she will turn out well . ”
128956	128972	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . ”
128973	128983	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ Did you go by the village of Kympton ? ”
128984	128993	128789	128789	she	120	“ I do not recollect that we did . ”
128994	129029	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had . A most delightful place ! Excellent parsonage - house ! It would have suited me in every respect . ”
129030	129039	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ How should you have liked making sermons ? ”
129040	129126	128789	128789	she	120	“ Exceedingly well . I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be . Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance when you were in Kent ? ”
129127	129161	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ I _ have _ heard from authority , which I thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . ”
129162	129188	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ You have ! Yes , there was something in _ that _ ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . ”
129189	129241	128789	128789	she	120	“ I _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . ”
129242	129272	128841	128841	Elizabeth	120	“ You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . ”
129320	129357	129358	129358	She	2847	“ Come , Mr. Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . Do not let us quarrel about the past . In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . ”
129388	129394	129364	129364	he	2848	“ Mr. Darcy with him . ”
129499	129506	129507	129507	she	141	“ Oh , my dear Lydia , ”
129510	129517	129507	129507	she	141	“ when shall we meet again ? ”
129518	129537	129595	129595	his	113	“ Oh , Lord ! I do n’t know . Not these two or three years , perhaps . ”
129538	129548	129507	129507	she	141	“ Write to me very often , my dear . ”
129549	129585	129507	129507	she	141	“ As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to _ me _ . They will have nothing else to do . ”
129611	129619	129621	129622	Mr. Bennet	130	“ He is as fine a fellow , ”
129634	129678	129621	129622	Mr. Bennet	130	“ as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law . ”
129693	129698	129700	129700	she	322	“ I often think , ”
129702	129723	129700	129700	she	322	“ that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ’s friends . One seems so forlorn without them . ”
129724	129740	129742	129742	Elizabeth	120	“ This is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , ”
129744	129758	129742	129742	Elizabeth	120	“ It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . ”
129759	129804	129700	129700	she	322	“ It is no such thing . Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ’s regiment happens to be so far off . If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . ”
129900	129915	129894	129894	her	141	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ”
129927	130027	129894	129894	her	141	“ Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what _ may _ happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , it is quite certain he is coming ? ”
130028	130035	130037	130038	the other	3653	“ You may depend on it , ”
130040	130130	130037	130038	the other	3653	“ for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night : I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certainly true . He comes down on Thursday , at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . She was going to the butcher ’s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . ”
130172	130289	130170	130170	she	120	“ I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n’t imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people ’s remarks . ”
130364	130370	130371	130371	she	120	“ Yet it is hard , ”
130375	130408	130371	130371	she	120	“ that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I _ will _ leave him to himself . ”
130482	130494	130496	130497	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , ”
130499	130509	130496	130497	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ you will wait on him , of course . ”
130510	130561	130562	130562	His	2870	“ No , no . You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ’s errand again . ”
130587	130597	130599	130599	he	2870	“ ’ Tis an _ etiquette _ I despise , ”
130601	130642	130599	130599	he	2870	“ If he wants our society , let him seek it . He knows where we live . I will not spend _ my _ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . ”
130643	130712	130718	130718	she	2873	“ Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . But , however , that sha n’t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon . That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . ”
130765	130777	130779	130779	Jane	181	“ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ”
130784	130848	130779	130779	Jane	181	“ It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! ”
130849	130860	130862	130862	Elizabeth	120	“ I wish I could say anything to comfort you , ”
130864	130900	130862	130862	Elizabeth	120	“ but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . ”
131041	131051	131053	131053	Kitty	145	“ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ”
131055	131061	131053	131053	Kitty	145	“ who can it be ? ”
131062	131082	131026	131026	she	120	“ Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . ”
131083	131086	131088	131088	Kitty	145	“ La ! ”
131090	131117	131088	131088	Kitty	145	“ it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what ’s his name -- that tall , proud man . ”
131118	131163	131164	131164	Jane	181	“ Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does , I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley ’s will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . ”
131472	131481	131483	131483	she	181	“ Let me first see how he behaves , ”
131485	131495	131483	131483	she	181	“ it will then be early enough for expectation . ”
131938	131947	131949	131949	she	120	“ Could I expect it to be otherwise ? ”
131951	131958	131949	131949	she	120	“ Yet why did he come ? ”
131993	132008	132010	132011	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ”
132019	132205	132209	132209	he	115	“ I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in the ‘ Times ’ and the ‘ Courier , ’ I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , ‘ Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , ’ without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . It was my brother Gardiner ’s drawing up , too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? ”
132237	132255	132257	132258	her mother	439	“ It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , ”
132260	132357	132257	132258	her mother	439	“ but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me . They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the Regulars . Thank heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though , perhaps , not so many as he deserves . ”
132429	132442	132444	132445	her mother	439	“ When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , ”
132447	132491	132444	132445	her mother	439	“ I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet ’s manor . I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . ”
132561	132569	132571	132571	she	120	“ The first wish of my heart , ”
132575	132614	132571	132571	she	120	“ is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! ”
132787	132800	132801	132801	she	120	“ You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , ”
132804	132857	132801	132801	she	120	“ for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . ”
132955	132961	132963	132964	CHAPTER LIV	282	“ Jane happened to look round ”
133012	133028	133030	133030	she	120	“ Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , ”
133032	133039	133030	133030	she	120	“ did he come at all ? ”
133052	133112	133113	133113	Her	120	“ He could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teasing , teasing man ! I will think no more about him . ”
133147	133150	133152	133152	she	120	“ Now , ”
133154	133213	133152	133152	she	120	“ that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . ”
133214	133222	133224	133224	Elizabeth	120	“ Yes , very indifferent , indeed , ”
133228	133236	133224	133224	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , Jane ! take care . ”
133237	133256	133152	133152	she	120	“ My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now . ”
133257	133278	133279	133279	They	2924	“ I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . ”
133820	133833	133835	133835	she	120	“ If he does not come to me , _ then _ , ”
133837	133846	133835	133835	she	120	“ I shall give him up for ever . ”
133937	133960	133920	133923	one of the girls	2946	“ The men sha n’t come and part us , I am determined . We want none of them ; do we ? ”
134007	134064	134001	134001	herself	120	“ A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . ”
134090	134098	134084	134084	she	120	“ Is your sister at Pemberley still ? ”
134099	134109	134084	134084	she	120	“ Yes ; she will remain there till Christmas . ”
134110	134122	134084	134084	she	120	“ And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? ”
134123	134142	134143	134143	She	120	“ Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks . ”
134352	134357	134359	134359	she	120	“ Well , girls , ”
134370	134560	134359	134359	she	120	“ what say you to the day ? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ’ last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ‘ Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last ! ’ She did , indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . ”
134564	134573	134359	134359	she	120	“ M^{rs } . Long and her nieces . ”
134649	134658	134660	134661	Miss Bennet	120	“ It has been a very agreeable day , ”
134665	134688	134689	134689	Elizabeth	120	“ The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . ”
134692	134786	134689	134689	Elizabeth	120	“ Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . ”
134787	134793	134795	134796	her sister	525	“ You are very cruel , ”
134798	134815	134795	134796	her sister	525	“ you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . ”
134816	134850	134689	134689	Elizabeth	120	“ How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! And how impossible in others ! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? ”
134851	134900	134795	134796	her sister	525	“ That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _ me _ your confidante . ”
134904	134917	134795	134796	her sister	525	“ Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak to you . ”
134999	135005	135007	135007	she	141	“ Next time you call , ”
135009	135018	135007	135007	she	141	“ I hope we shall be more lucky . ”
135052	135060	135075	135075	her	141	“ Can you come to - morrow ? ”
135126	135183	135112	135112	her	141	“ My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come . He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy ’s hair . ”
135184	135195	135197	135197	Jane	181	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ”
135199	135221	135197	135197	Jane	181	“ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . ”
135222	135252	135255	135255	her	181	“ Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come , be quick , be quick ! where is your sash , my dear ? ”
135362	135385	135357	135357	she	145	“ What is the matter , mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? ”
135386	135400	135357	135357	she	145	“ Nothing , child , nothing . I did not wink at you . ”
135427	135441	135418	135418	she	120	“ Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , ”
135492	135505	135483	135484	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . ”
135512	135525	135527	135528	her mother	439	“ We may as well leave them by themselves , you know , ”
135538	135553	135527	135528	her mother	439	“ Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . ”
136118	136124	136125	136125	she	181	“ ’ Tis too much ! ”
136128	136149	136125	136125	she	181	“ by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh , why is not everybody as happy ? ”
136210	136219	136220	136220	she	181	“ I must go instantly to my mother , ”
136223	136285	136220	136220	she	181	“ I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude , or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh , Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ? ”
136347	136351	136353	136353	she	120	“ And this , ”
136355	136386	136353	136353	she	120	“ is the end of all his friend ’s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ’s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , and most reasonable end ! ”
136410	136416	136418	136418	he	115	“ Where is your sister ? ”
136427	136445	136446	136446	He	115	“ With my mother upstairs . She will be down in a moment , I dare say . ”
136717	136732	136710	136710	he	130	“ Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . ”
136749	136756	136757	136757	he	130	“ You are a good girl , ”
136760	136833	136757	136757	he	130	“ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ”
136834	136854	136867	136868	his wife	322	“ I hope not so . Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _ me _ . ”
136855	136865	136867	136868	his wife	322	“ Exceed their income ! My dear Mr. Bennet , ”
136870	136893	136867	136868	his wife	322	“ what are you talking of ? Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . ”
136899	137002	136867	136868	his wife	322	“ Oh , my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha n’t get a wink of sleep all night . I knew how it would be . I always said it must be so , at last . I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . Oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! ”
137215	137223	137225	137225	she	181	“ He has made me so happy , ”
137230	137254	137225	137225	she	181	“ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . ”
137255	137261	137263	137263	Elizabeth	120	“ I suspected as much , ”
137265	137274	137263	137263	Elizabeth	120	“ But how did he account for it ? ”
137275	137364	137225	137225	she	181	“ It must have been his sisters ’ doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ”
137365	137373	137375	137375	Elizabeth	120	“ That is the most unforgiving speech , ”
137377	137408	137375	137375	Elizabeth	120	“ that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ’s pretended regard . ”
137409	137449	137225	137225	she	181	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ”
137450	137471	137375	137375	Elizabeth	120	“ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ”
137539	137551	137553	137553	Jane	181	“ I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! ”
137555	137594	137553	137553	Jane	181	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! If there were but such another man for you ! ”
137595	137661	137677	137678	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . ”
138083	138103	138109	138109	she	141	“ I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady , I suppose , is your mother ? ”
138112	138127	138075	138075	she	141	“ And _ that _ , I suppose , is one of your sisters ? ”
138128	138133	138135	138136	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Yes , madam , ”
138146	138192	138135	138136	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the ground , walking with a young man , who , I believe , will soon become a part of the family . ”
138193	138202	138204	138205	Lady Catherine	145	“ You have a very small park here , ”
138212	138244	138204	138205	Lady Catherine	145	“ It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my Lady , I dare say ; but , I assure you , it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ’s . ”
138245	138267	138268	138269	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ This must be a most inconvenient sitting - room for the evening in summer : the windows are full west . ”
138283	138302	138268	138269	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well ? ”
138303	138317	138268	138269	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . ”
138393	138435	138392	138392	Elizabeth,--	232	“ Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . ”
138436	138442	138444	138445	her mother	439	“ Go , my dear , ”
138447	138467	138468	138468	Elizabeth	120	“ and show her Ladyship about the different walks . I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . ”
138587	138592	138598	138599	George Allen	94	“ After a short survey ”
138604	138615	138617	138617	she	120	“ How could I ever think her like her nephew ? ”
138641	138676	138677	138677	Elizabeth	120	“ You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . ”
138683	138709	138677	138677	Elizabeth	120	“ Indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . ”
138710	138714	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Miss Bennet , ”
138724	138897	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness ; and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _ you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew -- my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . ”
138898	138908	138910	138910	Elizabeth	120	“ If you believed it impossible to be true , ”
138918	138938	138910	138910	Elizabeth	120	“ I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your Ladyship propose by it ? ”
138939	138952	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . ”
138953	138966	138968	138968	Elizabeth	120	“ Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , ”
138971	138991	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ will be rather a confirmation of it -- if , indeed , such a report is in existence . ”
138992	139026	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ If ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? ”
139027	139035	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ I never heard that it was . ”
139036	139053	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ And can you likewise declare , that there is no _ foundation _ for it ? ”
139054	139083	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship . _ You _ may ask questions which _ I _ shall not choose to answer . ”
139084	139115	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? ”
139116	139126	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible . ”
139127	139185	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But _ your _ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . ”
139186	139201	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . ”
139202	139246	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . ”
139247	139272	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . ”
139273	139319	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to _ my daughter _ . Now , what have you to say ? ”
139320	139343	139344	139345	Lady Catherine	145	“ Only this,--that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . ”
139354	139498	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers . While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? ”
139499	139607	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Yes ; and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh . You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? ”
139608	139688	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Because honour , decorum , prudence -- nay , interest -- forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ”
139689	139695	139697	139697	Elizabeth	120	“ These are heavy misfortunes , ”
139699	139733	139697	139697	Elizabeth	120	“ But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . ”
139734	139825	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person ’s whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . ”
139826	139852	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ _ That _ will make your Ladyship ’s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . ”
139853	139996	139697	139697	Elizabeth	120	“ I will not be interrupted ! Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ’s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled , families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune ! Is this to be endured ? But it must not , shall not be ! If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ”
139997	140031	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ’s daughter ; so far we are equal . ”
140032	140066	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ True . You _ are _ a gentleman ’s daughter . But what was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . ”
140067	140074	140076	140076	Elizabeth	120	“ Whatever my connections may be , ”
140078	140097	140076	140076	Elizabeth	120	“ if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . ”
140098	140112	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ”
140143	140148	140149	140150	Lady Catherine	145	“ I am not . ”
140154	140168	140149	140150	Lady Catherine	145	“ And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? ”
140169	140179	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ I will make no promise of the kind . ”
140180	140229	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Miss Bennet , I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . ”
140230	140409	140149	140150	Lady Catherine	145	“ And I certainly _ never _ shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . ”
140410	140538	138716	138717	her Ladyship	899	“ Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ’s infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man ’s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle . And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew ’s sister ? Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father ’s steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? ”
140539	140551	140552	140552	she	3075	“ You can _ now _ have nothing further to say , ”
140556	140576	140552	140552	she	3075	“ You have insulted me , in every possible method . I must beg to return to the house . ”
140600	140640	140594	140595	Her Ladyship	899	“ You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? ”
140641	140657	140552	140552	she	3075	“ Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say . You know my sentiments . ”
140658	140667	140594	140595	Her Ladyship	899	“ You are then resolved to have him ? ”
140668	140715	140594	140595	Her Ladyship	899	“ I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ”
140716	140767	140552	140552	she	3075	“ It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ”
140768	140778	140780	140780	Elizabeth	120	“ Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , ”
140782	140864	140780	140780	Elizabeth	120	“ has any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ”
140865	140928	140952	140952	she	145	“ And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . ”
140954	140985	140952	140952	she	145	“ I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . ”
141049	141056	141058	141059	her daughter	660	“ She did not choose it , ”
141061	141066	141058	141059	her daughter	660	“ she would go . ”
141067	141141	141142	141142	Elizabeth	120	“ She is a very fine - looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . She is on her road somewhere , I dare say ; and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? ”
141168	141174	141058	141059	her daughter	660	“ But now it comes out ”
141667	141689	141690	141690	she	120	“ If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , ”
141693	141745	141690	141690	she	120	“ I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . ”
141828	141831	141833	141833	he	442	“ Lizzy , ”
141835	141849	141833	141833	he	442	“ I was going to look for you : come into my room . ”
141923	141978	141920	141920	He	442	“ I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . I did not know before that I had _ two _ daughters on the brink of matrimony . Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . ”
142037	142079	142034	142035	her father	442	“ You look conscious . Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even _ your _ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer . This letter is from Mr. Collins . ”
142080	142095	142034	142035	her father	442	“ From Mr. Collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? ”
142096	142491	142492	142492	Elizabeth	120	“ Something very much to the purpose , of course . He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point . What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been advertised by the same authority . Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ’ Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? ‘ This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ’s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ’ Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? But now it comes out . ‘ My motive for cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ’ _ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you . Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life ! It is admirable ! ”
142526	142532	142513	142513	his	442	“ Are you not diverted ? ”
142533	142542	142513	142513	his	442	“ Oh , yes . Pray read on . ”
142543	142887	142513	142513	his	442	“ ‘ After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ’ Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ‘ I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ’s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ’ _ That _ is his notion of Christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ’s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be _ missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ”
142888	142891	142893	142893	Elizabeth	120	“ Oh , ”
142895	142907	142893	142893	Elizabeth	120	“ I am exceedingly diverted . But it is so strange ! ”
142908	143029	142513	142513	his	442	“ Yes , _ that _ is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins ’s correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? ”
143149	143155	143161	143162	George Allen	94	“ The efforts of his aunt ”
143419	143508	143416	143416	she	120	“ Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ”
143509	143517	143519	143519	Darcy	142	“ I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , ”
143529	143563	143519	143519	Darcy	142	“ that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . ”
143564	143645	143416	143416	she	120	“ You must not blame my aunt . Lydia ’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ”
143646	143655	143656	143656	he	142	“ If you _ will _ thank me , ”
143659	143719	143656	143656	he	142	“ let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your _ family _ owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _ you _ . ”
143739	143789	143735	143736	her companion	1971	“ You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . _ My _ affections and wishes are unchanged ; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ”
144103	144110	144112	144112	he	1971	“ It taught me to hope , ”
144114	144159	144112	144112	he	1971	“ as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly . ”
144168	144210	144165	144165	she	120	“ Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ”
144211	144264	144112	144112	he	1971	“ What did you say of me that I did not deserve ? For though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . ”
144265	144281	144283	144283	Elizabeth	120	“ We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , ”
144285	144313	144283	144283	Elizabeth	120	“ The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then we have both , I hope , improved in civility . ”
144314	144424	144112	144112	he	1971	“ I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ‘ Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ’ Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . ”
144425	144457	144283	144283	Elizabeth	120	“ I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ”
144458	144513	144283	144283	Elizabeth	120	“ I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . ”
144514	144547	144112	144112	he	1971	“ Oh , do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . ”
144553	144557	144548	144548	Darcy	142	“ Did it , ”
144559	144585	144586	144586	She	3130	he,--“did it _ soon _ make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? ”
144607	144611	144613	144613	he	142	“ I knew , ”
144615	144674	144613	144613	he	142	“ that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part , especially the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ”
144675	144725	144586	144586	She	3130	“ The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ”
144726	144733	144735	144735	Darcy	142	“ When I wrote that letter , ”
144737	144762	144735	144735	Darcy	142	“ I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ”
144763	144849	144586	144586	She	3130	“ The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ”
144850	145162	144586	144586	She	3130	“ I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _ Your _ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . But with _ me _ , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight - and - twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . ”
145163	145173	145443	145443	He	142	“ Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? ”
145174	145198	144586	144586	She	3130	“ Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . ”
145199	145244	144586	144586	She	3130	“ My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! ”
145245	145269	145443	145443	He	142	“ Hate you ! I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . ”
145270	145294	144586	144586	She	3130	“ I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? ”
145295	145306	144586	144586	She	3130	“ No , indeed , I felt nothing but surprise . ”
145307	145352	145443	145443	He	142	“ Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . ”
145353	145360	145362	145362	Darcy	142	“ My object _ then _ , ”
145364	145442	145362	145362	Darcy	142	“ was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves , I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . ”
145578	145589	145603	145603	Darcy	222	“ What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ? ”
145621	145630	145632	145632	Elizabeth	120	“ I must ask whether you were surprised ? ”
145634	145652	145632	145632	Elizabeth	120	“ Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . ”
145653	145670	145673	145673	he	142	“ That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . ”
145690	145700	145702	145702	he	142	“ On the evening before my going to London , ”
145704	145806	145702	145702	he	142	“ I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . ”
145821	145830	145832	145832	she	120	“ Did you speak from your own observation , ”
145834	145853	145832	145832	she	120	“ when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? ”
145854	145885	145702	145702	he	142	“ From the former . I had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . ”
145886	145902	145702	145702	he	142	“ And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . ”
145903	146024	145702	145702	he	142	“ It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ’s sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . ”
146113	146119	146125	146126	George Allen	94	“ Unable to utter a syllable ”
146137	146150	146131	146132	CHAPTER LIX	286	“ My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? ”
146371	146405	146365	146365	she	120	“ You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be ! Engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . ”
146406	146463	146464	146464	Jane	181	“ This is a wretched beginning , indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . ”
146470	146488	146464	146464	Jane	181	“ Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . ”
146489	146544	146545	146546	Miss Bennet	120	“ You know nothing of the matter . _ That _ is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . ”
146565	146582	146584	146584	Jane	181	“ Good heaven ! can it be really so ? Yet now I must believe you , ”
146586	146622	146584	146584	Jane	181	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ”
146623	146666	146552	146552	Elizabeth	120	“ There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? ”
146667	146730	146552	146552	Elizabeth	120	“ Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ”
146731	146756	146584	146584	Jane	181	“ Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . ”
146757	146763	146552	146552	Elizabeth	120	“ What do you mean ? ”
146764	146788	146552	146552	Elizabeth	120	“ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . ”
146789	146832	146584	146584	Jane	181	“ My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know everything that I am to know without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ”
146833	146867	146871	146871	she	3149	“ It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . ”
146909	146916	146918	146918	she	120	“ Now I am quite happy , ”
146920	147022	146918	146918	she	120	“ for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ’s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . ”
147087	147091	147093	147094	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ Good gracious ! ”
147106	147189	147097	147097	she	141	“ if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ’s way . ”
147253	147275	147247	147247	he	115	“ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”
147276	147288	147290	147291	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ”
147293	147318	147290	147291	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ”
147319	147329	147331	147332	Mr. Bingley	115	“ It may do very well for the others , ”
147334	147353	147331	147332	Mr. Bingley	115	“ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n’t it , Kitty ? ”
147396	147461	147390	147391	Mrs. Bennet	141	“ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ”
147734	147747	147748	147748	She	120	“ Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . ”
147766	147769	147771	147771	he	442	“ Lizzy , ”
147773	147798	147771	147771	he	442	“ what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? ”
147858	147900	147843	147843	she	120	“ Or , in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? ”
147901	147908	147910	147910	Elizabeth	120	“ Have you any other objection , ”
147912	147920	147843	147843	she	120	“ than your belief of my indifference ? ”
147921	147951	147843	147843	she	120	“ None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ”
147952	147961	147962	147962	she	120	“ I do , I do like him , ”
147971	148011	147962	147962	she	120	“ I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ”
148012	148015	148017	148018	her father	442	“ Lizzy , ”
148020	148168	148017	148018	her father	442	“ I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . ”
148265	148271	148273	148273	he	142	“ Well , my dear , ”
148280	148314	148273	148273	he	142	“ I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . ”
148340	148454	148334	148334	He	142	“ This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ’s debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle ’s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ”
148495	148517	148490	148490	she	120	“ If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . ”
148714	148865	148687	148687	She	141	“ Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ? And is it really true ? Oh , my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane ’s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . I am so pleased -- so happy . Such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Everything that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! what will become of me ? I shall go distracted . ”
148914	148919	148920	148920	she	439	“ My dearest child , ”
148923	148991	148920	148920	she	439	“ I can think of nothing else . Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ’ Tis as good as a lord ! And a special licence -- you must and shall be married by a special licence . But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . ”
149131	149144	149146	149146	he	130	“ I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , ”
149148	149174	149146	149146	he	130	“ Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane ’s . ”
149178	149183	149146	149146	he	130	“ The obsequious civility . ”
149226	149232	149234	149234	she	120	“ How could you begin ? ”
149236	149264	149234	149234	she	120	“ I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ”
149265	149312	149210	149210	she	120	“ I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . ”
149313	149371	149234	149234	she	120	“ My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? ”
149372	149382	149234	149234	she	120	“ For the liveliness of your mind I did . ”
149383	149557	149210	149210	she	120	“ You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure you know no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . ”
149558	149577	149234	149234	she	120	“ Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? ”
149578	149703	149234	149234	she	120	“ Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ”
149704	149718	149210	149210	she	120	“ Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ”
149719	149725	149234	149234	she	120	“ But I was embarrassed . ”
149726	149731	149234	149234	she	120	“ And so was I. ”
149732	149746	149210	149210	she	120	“ You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . ”
149747	149756	149234	149234	she	120	“ A man who had felt less might . ”
149757	149875	149234	149234	she	120	“ How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . _ Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? This will never do . ”
149876	149957	149210	149210	she	120	“ You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine ’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours . My aunt ’s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know everything . ”
149958	150015	149234	149234	she	120	“ Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequences ? ”
150016	150086	149234	149234	she	120	“ My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . ”
150087	150104	149210	149210	she	120	“ Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? ”
150105	150141	149234	149234	she	120	“ I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . ”
150142	150190	149234	149234	she	120	“ And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ”
150259	150485	150488	150489	Mr. Darcy	142	“ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , ”
150523	150529	150530	150530	I	0	“ Dear Sir , * / “
150578	150582	150572	150572	He	3110	“ Yours sincerely , ”
151670	151677	151678	151678	I	0	“ My dear Lizzy , * / “
151795	151798	151784	151785	Mr. Darcy	142	“ Yours , ”
