1268	1291	1262	1262	he	415	“ Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again . What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! ”
1292	1359	1262	1262	he	415	“ I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not . Mr. Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? ”
1360	1393	1262	1262	he	415	“ A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own ? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours , my dear . ”
1394	1430	1262	1262	he	415	“ How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us!—We shall be always meeting ! We must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . ”
1431	1457	1262	1262	he	415	“ My dear , how am I to get so far ? Randalls is such a distance . I could not walk half so far . ”
1458	1480	1262	1262	he	415	“ No , papa , nobody thought of your walking . We must go in the carriage , to be sure . ”
1481	1514	1262	1262	he	415	“ The carriage ! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? ”
1515	1618	1262	1262	he	415	“ They are to be put into Mr. Weston ’s stable , papa . You know we have settled all that already . We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ’s being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . That was your doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place . Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her — James is so obliged to you ! ”
1619	1794	1262	1262	he	415	“ I am very glad I did think of her . It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . He will be able to tell her how we all are . ”

2017	2051	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . ”
2052	2079	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire . ”
2080	2100	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold . ”
2101	2117	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them . ”
2118	2160	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding . ”
2161	2218	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ By the bye — I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ? ”
2219	2232	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! ’ Tis a sad business . ”
2233	2293	2012	2013	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly say ‘ poor Miss Taylor . ’ I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . ”
2294	2309	2311	2311	Emma	79	“ Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! ”
2314	2340	2311	2311	Emma	79	“ That is what you have in your head , I know — and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . ”
2341	2354	2356	2357	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , ”
2363	2375	2356	2357	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . ”
2376	2443	2444	2445	Mr. Knightley	88	“ My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean you , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know — in a joke — it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another . ”
2520	2528	2530	2531	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Emma knows I never flatter her , ”
2533	2572	2530	2531	Mr. Knightley	88	“ but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer . ”
2573	2576	2578	2578	Emma	79	“ Well , ”
2584	2658	2530	2531	Mr. Knightley	88	pass—“you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day . ”
2659	2668	2670	2671	her father	415	“ Dear Emma bears every thing so well , ”
2673	2704	2670	2671	her father	415	“ But , Mr. Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for . ”
2717	2730	2732	2733	Mr. Knightley	88	“ It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion , ”
2735	2838	2732	2733	Mr. Knightley	88	“ We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ’s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ’s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . ”
2839	2851	2853	2853	Emma	79	“ And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , ”
2855	2914	2853	2853	Emma	79	“ and a very considerable one — that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . ”
2928	2962	2918	2918	his	88	“ Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches . ”
2963	3135	2923	2924	Her father	415	“ I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people . It is the greatest amusement in the world ! And after such success , you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no ! Mr. Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful — Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . Oh no ! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again . Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it . “

3930	5189	5190	5190	I	0	” CHAPTER II Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied . Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune — though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate — was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum . It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness . Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best . She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ’s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe . Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ’ marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved . The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ’s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease . Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . A complete change of life became desirable . He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought just employment enough . He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . He had , by that time , realised an easy competence — enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for — enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition . It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished . He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it . He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ’s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age . It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ’s assistance . His father had no apprehension of it . The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston ’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear . He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too . He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved . Now , upon his father ’s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place . There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates , or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit . Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion . For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received . “
5246	5623	5233	5233	he	81	” It was , indeed , a highly prized letter . Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ’s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ’s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston ’s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction — her more than satisfaction — her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ‘ poor Miss Taylor , ’ when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse ’s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , “
5638	7846	5630	5630	She	80	” There was no recovering Miss Taylor — nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse . The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up . His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself . What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ’s eating it . He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry , the apothecary , on the subject . Mr. Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse ’s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many — perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately . With such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone . There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston ’s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it . CHAPTER III Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such . Not unfrequently , through Emma ’s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse ’s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses . Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance . Mrs. Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders . She loved every body , was interested in every body ’s happiness , quicksighted to every body ’s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself . She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School — not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems — and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity — but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies . Mrs. Goddard ’s school was in high repute — and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse ’s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ’s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston . She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody . Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs. Goddard ’s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder . This was all that was generally known of her history . She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her . She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired . She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ’s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging — not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk — and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm . They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell — very creditably , she believed — she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them — but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . She would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners . It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers . She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse ’s feelings were in sad warfare . He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : “
7996	8707	7986	7986	I	0	” Emma allowed her father to talk — but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions . Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last ! CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith ’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing . Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . In that respect Mrs. Weston ’s loss had been important . Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs. Weston ’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined . She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs . Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ’s being exactly the young friend she wanted — exactly the something which her home required . Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question . Two such could never be granted . Two such she did not want . It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing . Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell . She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain . Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked — but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth . Harriet had no penetration . She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . Mrs. Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation — and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole . But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . Emma encouraged her talkativeness — amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin ’s having “
8838	9252	9256	9257	Mrs. Martin	111	” For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose . She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ’s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it . Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging . He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging . He had his shepherd ’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her . She was very fond of singing . He could sing a little himself . She believed he was very clever , and understood every thing . He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . She believed every body spoke well of him . His mother and sisters were very fond of him . Mrs. Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it , ) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband . Not that she wanted him to marry . She was in no hurry at all . “
9259	9263	9256	9257	Mrs. Martin	111	” thought Emma . “
9271	9272	9256	9257	Mrs. Martin	111	” “
9336	9337	9328	9329	Miss Richardson	115	” “
9363	9364	9358	9358	He	112	” “
9503	9509	9511	9514	sort of looking man	506	” The next question was — “
9519	9520	9516	9517	Mr. Martin	112	” “
9598	9599	9591	9591	He	112	” “
9726	9727	9721	9721	he	112	” “
9759	9760	9747	9747	he	112	” “
9802	9803	9795	9795	you	0	” “
9837	9838	9795	9795	you	0	” “
9925	9926	9931	9933	Dear Miss Woodhouse	80	” “
9942	9943	9935	9935	he	112	” “
10058	10059	10076	10078	no indoors man	521	” “
10100	10101	10090	10091	Mrs. Martin	111	” “
10225	10226	10233	10233	I	0	” “
10267	10268	10269	10269	You	523	” “
10385	10386	10395	10395	I	0	” “
10507	10772	10790	10790	he	540	” Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love . The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ’s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . They met Mr. Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road . He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion . Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin . His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ’s inclination . Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder . Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose . “
10896	10897	10889	10889	you	90	” “
10966	10967	10954	10954	him	540	” “
10972	10981	10954	10954	him	540	” said Harriet , in a mortified voice , “
10991	10992	10993	10993	I	0	” “
11140	11141	11144	11144	he	112	” “
11183	11184	11185	11186	Mr. Knightley	88	” “
11278	11279	11272	11272	You	107	” “
11305	11306	11296	11297	Mr. Weston	82	” “
11383	11384	11373	11373	he	112	” “
11392	11398	11373	11373	he	112	” replied Harriet rather solemnly . “
11431	11432	11434	11434	he	112	” “
11444	11445	11434	11434	he	112	” “
11538	11539	11540	11540	I	0	” “
11547	11587	11540	11540	I	0	book”—was all Harriet ’s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time . Her next beginning was , “
11834	12242	11826	11826	he	91	” She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable . Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ’s head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet ’s coming to Hartfield . The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency . Mr. Elton ’s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet . He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ’s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy . And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ’s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton ’s admiration . CHAPTER V “
12256	12261	12253	12254	Mrs. Weston	84	” said Mr. Knightley , “
12280	12281	12273	12273	I	0	” “
12296	12297	12287	12287	you	563	” “

12788	12789	12790	12790	I	0	” “
12794	12801	12790	12790	I	0	” replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , “
12826	12827	12816	12816	Emma	79	” “
12839	12855	12816	12816	Emma	79	that,”—said Mr. Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . “
12859	12864	12857	12857	I	0	” he soon added , “
12979	12980	12981	12981	I	0	” “
13040	13041	13029	13029	you	88	” “
13044	13050	13029	13029	you	88	” said he , smiling . “

13180	13181	13169	13171	a good wife	592	” “

13624	13625	13619	13622	a partial old friend	601	” “
13737	13738	13730	13731	Mr. Knightley	88	” “
13750	13754	13755	13755	I	0	” he replied . “
13834	13835	13837	13837	I	0	” “
13930	13931	13921	13921	she	79	” “

14175	14176	14165	14166	Mr. Knightley	88	” “
14181	14185	14165	14166	Mr. Knightley	88	” cried he ; “
14222	14223	14224	14226	Mrs. John Knightley	117	” “
14240	14241	14224	14226	Mrs. John Knightley	117	” “
14245	14249	14224	14226	Mrs. John Knightley	117	” said he , “
14318	14319	14310	14310	I	0	” “
14324	14330	14310	14310	I	0	” said Mrs. Weston gently , “
14334	14335	14336	14336	She	79	” “
14432	14433	14418	14418	nobody	3124	” “
14452	14457	14418	14418	nobody	3124	” said Mrs. Weston , “
14518	14576	14514	14514	I	0	” Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston ’s on the subject , as much as possible . There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma ’s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to “
14590	14791	14579	14579	Weston	82	” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield . CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ’s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton ’s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ’s side , as there could be any occasion for . She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton ’s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . She had no scruple with regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ’s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . “
14802	14806	14807	14807	you	625	” said he ; “
14847	14848	14849	14849	I	0	” “
14898	14899	14892	14892	I	0	” “
14909	14916	14917	14917	I	0	” said the gallant Mr. Elton — “
14945	14946	14917	14917	I	0	” “
14970	14971	14917	14917	I	0	” “
14992	14993	14994	14994	I	0	” “
15001	15048	14994	14994	I	0	” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ’s picture . “
15059	15063	15065	15065	you	0	” said she : “
15072	15095	15065	15065	you	0	” Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naïveté , “
15104	15117	15065	15065	you	0	” No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , “
15229	15230	15232	15232	me	0	” “
15236	15241	15232	15232	me	0	” cried Mr. Elton ; “
15315	15357	15299	15300	Mrs. Weston	84	” Yes , good man!—thought Emma — but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? You know nothing of drawing . Do n’t pretend to be in raptures about mine . Keep your raptures for Harriet ’s face . “
15418	15419	15413	15413	one	475	” “
15471	15472	15478	15479	Mr. Elton	91	” “
15521	15522	15499	15499	you	627	” “
15554	15852	15548	15548	she	107	” Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn . She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . She played and sang;—and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of . She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . There was merit in every drawing — in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . They were both in ecstasies . A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ’s performances must be capital . “
15861	15865	15548	15548	she	107	” said Emma . “
16190	16203	16206	16206	my	0	last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length—“my
16292	16303	16267	16267	Weston	84	side”—after all this , came poor dear Isabella ’s cold approbation of—“Yes
16429	16446	16422	16422	I	0	” Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , “
16470	16663	16468	16468	wives	653	” with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer . She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr. John Knightley ’s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . But there was no doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere . It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . “
16702	16969	16698	16699	Miss Smith	107	” Mr. Elton was only too happy . Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ’s sketch to wish to go on . There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both — a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton ’s very promising attachment was likely to add . Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . “
16988	17045	16974	16974	We	662	” The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy . Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . “
17056	17072	16974	16974	We	662	wanted,”—observed Mrs. Weston to him — not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.—“The
17104	17105	17099	17099	she	90	” “
17111	17115	17107	17107	you	663	” replied he . “
17157	17158	17154	17154	you	663	” “
17168	17191	17166	17166	Emma	79	” said Mr. Knightley . Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , “
17264	17265	17316	17316	she	107	” “
17271	17276	17316	17316	she	107	” said Mr. Woodhouse . “
17344	17345	17339	17339	she	107	” “
17370	17371	17339	17339	she	107	” “
17386	17387	17388	17388	You	0	” “
17397	17402	17390	17390	sir	3139	” cried Mr. Elton , “
17481	17597	17474	17474	I	0	” The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December . But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was always on the alert . “
17644	17645	17646	17646	He	0	” “
17665	17730	17646	17646	He	0	world,”—brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . “
17736	17749	17750	17751	This man	672	” said he with a tender sigh , as he received it . “
17761	17765	17766	17766	I	0	” thought Emma . “
17857	18051	17850	17850	his	672	” CHAPTER VII The very day of Mr. Elton ’s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ’s services towards her friend . Harriet had been at Hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . Half a minute brought it all out . She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard ’s , that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr. Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . “
18129	18146	18111	18111	she	675	” Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful . “
18151	18155	18111	18111	she	675	” she cried , “
18180	18181	18171	18171	He	3228	” “
18188	18192	18183	18183	you	678	” cried Harriet . “
18201	18310	18198	18198	you	678	” Emma was not sorry to be pressed . She read , and was surprized . The style of the letter was much above her expectation . There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a “
18315	18324	18198	18198	you	678	” and was at last forced to add , “
18337	18338	18198	18198	you	678	” “
18348	18352	18357	18357	Harriet	107	” replied Emma rather slowly—“so
18519	18520	18508	18508	Harriet	107	” “
18523	18528	18508	18508	Harriet	107	” said the still waiting Harriet;—“well
18538	18539	18542	18542	you	0	” “
18558	18559	18550	18550	you	0	” “

18711	18718	18702	18702	You	0	” said Harriet , looking down . “
18794	18809	18782	18782	you	107	” Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : “
18821	18822	18818	18818	I	0	” “
18864	18865	18866	18866	I	0	” “

18911	18951	18899	18899	I	0	” said Harriet , contemplating the letter . For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , “
19056	19057	19050	19050	I	0	” “
19143	19144	19133	19133	you	107	” “
19150	19157	19159	19159	I	0	” said Emma , smiling graciously , “
19254	19316	19250	19250	you	107	” The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said — “
19367	19368	19361	19361	you	90	” “
19505	19523	19501	19501	you	107	” Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . “
19531	19538	19524	19524	You	107	” she cried , looking aghast . “
19588	19589	19567	19567	I	0	” “
19629	19630	19622	19622	I	0	” “
19653	19654	19644	19644	me	0	” “
19701	19702	19691	19691	He	3228	” “
19715	19725	19703	19703	I	0	” said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; “
19876	19877	19879	19879	you	107	” “
19925	19926	19882	19882	you	107	” “
19937	19953	19882	19882	you	107	” Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a “
19993	19994	19882	19882	you	107	” “
20038	20254	20035	20035	I	0	” Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . The business was finished , and Harriet safe . She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton . “
20266	20275	20255	20255	I	0	” was said in rather a sorrowful tone . “
20311	20312	20294	20294	You	715	” “
20334	20341	20342	20342	I	0	” Some time afterwards it was , “
20385	20386	20380	20383	a linen - draper	720	” “
20488	20535	20473	20473	I	0	” Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin . “
20543	20548	20537	20537	he	724	” said she softly . “
20584	20585	20573	20573	I	0	” “
20601	20605	20573	20573	I	0	” cried Emma . “
20656	20657	20658	20658	My	0	” “
20670	20671	20673	20673	he	91	” “
20775	20994	20997	20997	I	0	” Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger . CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night . For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard ’s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose . Mr. Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other . “
21074	21075	21076	21076	My	0	” “
21088	21089	21076	21076	My	0	” “
21126	21127	21128	21128	You	0	” “
21136	21137	21128	21128	You	0	” “
21184	21185	21187	21187	you	0	” “
21224	21274	21211	21211	I	0	” Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before . “
21285	21289	21275	21275	I	0	” said he ; “
21331	21332	21333	21333	I	0	” “
21353	21354	21345	21345	I	0	” “
21357	21361	21362	21362	you	749	” said he , “
21398	21399	21392	21392	she	748	” “
21443	21444	21434	21434	You	749	” “
21457	21458	21451	21451	you	749	” “
21473	21474	21463	21463	She	748	” “
21486	21487	21482	21483	some visitors	754	” “
21492	21493	21494	21494	Harriet	124	” “
21505	21528	21502	21502	you	749	” Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing . He presently added , with a smile , “
21564	21565	21552	21554	your little friend	755	” “
21575	21576	21552	21554	your little friend	755	” “
21586	21590	21552	21554	your little friend	755	” still smiling . “
21615	21653	21654	21654	I	0	” Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton ’s having dropt a hint . Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him . “
21660	21664	21654	21654	I	0	” he replied , “
21715	21716	21717	21717	He	0	” “
21722	21726	21717	21717	He	0	” said Emma ; “
21738	21739	21732	21732	Harriet	107	” “
22103	22104	22086	22086	she	774	” “
22110	22128	22107	22108	Mr. Knightley	88	” said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , “
22141	22142	22134	22135	Mr. Martin	112	” “
22145	22151	22134	22135	Mr. Martin	112	” replied he , surprized , “
22174	22175	22167	22167	she	774	” “
22178	22182	22183	22183	I	0	” said she , “
22213	22249	22206	22206	he	112	” This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , “
22269	22270	22264	22266	the foolish girl	777	” “
22277	22281	22264	22266	the foolish girl	777	” cried Emma , “
22316	22317	22300	22301	A man	548	” “
22357	22358	22359	22359	I	0	” “
22367	22368	22359	22359	I	0	” “
22392	22393	22385	22385	You	88	” “
22479	22480	22509	22509	he	112	” “
22486	22506	22509	22509	he	112	” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , “
22889	22890	22891	22891	I	0	” “
23054	23055	23019	23020	Mr. Martin	112	” “
23075	23076	23067	23073	a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer	803	” “
23196	23197	23192	23194	Mr. Robert Martin	112	” “
23204	23209	23192	23194	Mr. Robert Martin	112	” said Mr. Knightley , “
23439	23470	23435	23435	he	112	” It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . “
23762	23763	23765	23765	my	0	” “
23801	23802	23798	23798	you	79	” “
23807	23812	23798	23798	you	79	” cried she playfully . “
23920	23921	23922	23922	I	0	” “
23932	23938	23940	23940	I	0	” said Mr. Knightley presently , “
24221	24222	24203	24203	she	107	” “
24467	24468	24453	24460	nothing but a gentleman in education and manner	857	” “
24479	24482	24453	24460	nothing but a gentleman in education and manner	857	” cried Mr. Knightley.—“Robert
24512	24656	24657	24658	Robert Martin	112	” Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma ’s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer . He was thinking . The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . “
24748	24757	24762	24762	Elton	91	” Emma laughed and disclaimed . He continued , “
24918	24919	24920	24920	I	0	” “
24928	24935	24926	24926	you	91	” said Emma , laughing again . “
25002	25003	24968	24968	Harriet	107	” “
25007	25830	25832	25832	she	867	you,”—said he , rising and walking off abruptly . He was very much vexed . He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly . Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ’s , than in his . She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ’s wrong , as Mr. Knightley . He walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her . She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives . Harriet ’s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young man ’s coming to Mrs. Goddard ’s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ’s friendship and woman ’s feelings would not justify . He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley ’s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives . Mr. Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton . Harriet ’s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight . Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard ’s to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr. Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a very particular way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits . Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , “
25884	26358	25873	25874	Mr. Elton	91	” CHAPTER IX Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself . He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . She was sorry , but could not repent . On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton ’s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet ’s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin ’s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend ’s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow . It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ’s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs. Goddard ’s , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse ’s help , to get a great many more . Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity . Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . “
26389	26395	26396	26396	Kitty	128	” And it always ended in “
26404	26642	26396	26396	Kitty	128	” His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter . It was by no means his daughter ’s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition . Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade , My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin’d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal . — made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already . “
26656	26660	26646	26646	you	874	” said she ; “
26678	26679	26700	26702	The stupidest fellow	876	” “
26710	26713	26714	26715	Miss Smith	107	Woodhouse”—he stopt a moment—“or
26720	26792	26714	26715	Miss Smith	107	” The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . “
26804	26808	26793	26793	I	0	” said he . “
26839	26887	26908	26908	your	878	” The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand . There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ’s . He was gone the next moment:—after another moment ’s pause , “
26891	26902	26908	26908	your	878	” said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet—“it
26911	27107	26908	26908	your	878	” But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself . To Miss — — CHARADE . My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! But ah ! united , what reverse we have ! Man ’s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye ! She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , “
27299	27333	27339	27340	Miss Woodhouse?—what	880	” She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet ’s wondering questions . “
27496	27497	27487	27487	you	90	” “
27704	27754	27671	27671	Harriet	107	” Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness . She could not speak . But she was not wanted to speak . It was enough for her to feel . Emma spoke for her . “
27769	27773	27790	27790	his	91	” said she , “
28008	28009	28010	28012	Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and	132	” “
28012	28013	28010	28012	Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and	132	Woodhouse!”—and “
28018	28075	28014	28016	Dear Miss Woodhouse	132	” was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought . Mr. Elton ’s superiority had very ample acknowledgment . “
28083	28087	28077	28077	you	132	” cried Harriet , “
28170	28171	28172	28172	I	0	” “
28227	28228	28241	28241	I	0	” “
28261	28262	28272	28272	they	912	” “
28410	28411	28413	28414	Mr. Elton	91	” “
28630	28631	28627	28628	Mr. Cole	135	” “
28760	28761	28772	28772	I	0	” “
28813	28814	28803	28803	I	0	” “

28863	28864	28852	28852	I	0	” “
28878	28879	28880	28880	I	0	” “
28902	28923	28880	28880	I	0	” Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . “
28929	28939	28880	28880	I	0	” said she , presently — her cheeks in a glow—“to
28994	29010	29039	29040	Miss Woodhouse	132	” Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin ’s prose . “
29015	29017	29039	29040	Miss Woodhouse	132	” continued Harriet—“these
29049	29050	29039	29040	Miss Woodhouse	132	” “
29110	29111	29100	29100	their	932	” “

29168	29169	29132	29132	I	0	” “
29177	29180	29132	29132	I	0	” — — “
29306	29349	29350	29350	I	0	” Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . “
29363	29367	29350	29350	I	0	” said she . “
29371	29375	29397	29398	my father	3146	” replied Emma ; “
29458	29463	29452	29452	me	0	” Harriet looked grave . “
29583	29584	29566	29566	He	91	” “
29604	29628	29601	29601	you	107	” Mr. Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “
29646	29647	29650	29650	papa	3114	” “
29694	29752	29687	29687	we	936	” She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded — and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion . “
29808	29828	29806	29806	Emma	79	” Emma only nodded , and smiled.—After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , “
29963	29964	29956	29956	you	3120	” “
29994	29995	29988	29988	Garrick	137	” “
30070	30071	30048	30048	you	3120	” “
30111	30112	30113	30113	I	0	” “
30175	30176	30161	30161	she	83	” “
30188	30189	30183	30183	papa	3114	” “
30217	30218	30207	30207	I	0	” “
30236	30237	30224	30225	Mrs. Weston	84	” “
30267	30268	30224	30225	Mrs. Weston	84	” “
30367	30368	30340	30341	Mr. Knightley	88	” “
30391	30429	30382	30382	Isabella	83	” Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley ’s claims on his brother , or any body ’s claims on Isabella , except his own . He sat musing a little while , and then said , “
30477	30478	30481	30481	papa	3114	” “
30513	30569	30503	30503	Isabella	83	” This was too true for contradiction . Unwelcome as it was , Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ’s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them . “
30628	30629	30618	30618	she	107	” “
30661	30662	30659	30659	Harriet	107	” “
30682	30683	30674	30674	I	0	” “
30836	30837	30824	30824	I	0	” “
30844	30848	30838	30838	He	118	” said Emma , “
30923	30924	30915	30916	The children	3286	” “
30945	30946	30927	30928	their uncle	1001	” “
30994	30995	31014	31014	papa	3114	” “
31004	31005	31014	31014	papa	3114	” “
31030	31252	31016	31020	One half of the world	1006	” Later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o’clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again . Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push — of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse ’s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield . If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him — had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come . Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber . He re - urged — she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it — “
31318	31342	31308	31308	I	0	” Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say . He looked rather doubtingly — rather confused ; said something about “
31343	31384	31385	31385	You	1008	honour,”—glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively . With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said , “
31424	31425	31426	31426	I	0	” “
31433	31447	31448	31448	I	0	” replied Mr. Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; “
31514	31773	31502	31502	he	877	” After this speech he was gone as soon as possible . Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet ’s share . CHAPTER X Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury . Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr. Elton . A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be . It had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.—Emma ’s remark was — “
31791	31795	31502	31502	he	877	”—Harriet ’s was — “
31815	31816	31809	31810	Miss Nash	113	” “
31826	31834	31817	31817	I	0	” said Emma , as they proceeded , “
31866	31921	31922	31922	I	0	” Harriet , she found , had never in her life been inside the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr. Elton ’s seeing ready wit in her . “
31929	31933	31922	31922	I	0	” said she ; “
31963	31986	31960	31961	my father	3146	” She pondered , but could think of nothing . After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again — “
32014	32022	32011	32011	you	80	” — Emma laughed , and replied , “
32078	32079	32081	32081	you	80	” “
32091	32092	32093	32093	I	0	” “
32168	32169	32170	32170	Dear	1023	” “
32182	32184	32177	32178	a woman	3207	” — “
32334	32335	32327	32327	I	0	” “
32351	32352	32341	32343	an old maid	1033	” “
32435	32436	32420	32420	I	0	” “
32453	32454	32443	32445	an old maid	1033	” “
32697	32698	32685	32685	nobody	3124	” “
32718	32719	32710	32710	you	0	” “
32951	32952	32946	32947	a niece	1054	” “
32980	32981	32977	32977	you	0	” “
33124	33280	33118	33118	she	1055	” They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded . Emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse . She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will . In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away , “
33337	33338	33490	33490	Harriet	107	” “
33342	33346	33347	33348	Poor creatures	1066	” said Harriet . “
33357	33358	33350	33350	one	475	” “
33373	33407	33362	33362	I	0	” said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again . “
33415	33437	33408	33408	I	0	” stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within . “
33444	33487	33408	33408	I	0	” said her companion . They walked on . The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr. Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther , “
33565	33571	33683	33683	I	0	” Harriet could just answer , “
33578	33645	33683	33683	I	0	” before the gentleman joined them . The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting . He had been going to call on them . His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them . “
33659	33663	33683	33683	I	0	” thought Emma ; “
33712	34135	33705	33705	I	0	” Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road . But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ’s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her . This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ’s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . Mr. Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them . Mr. Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ’s party at his friend Cole ’s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the celery , the beet - root , and all the dessert . “
34148	34154	33705	33705	I	0	” was her consoling reflection ; “
34186	34283	34178	34178	I	0	” They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more . She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort . “
34291	34295	34178	34178	I	0	” said she , “
34365	34632	34345	34346	your housekeeper	1076	” Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it . It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious . “
34638	34642	34643	34643	he	1077	” thought Emma ; “
34659	35806	35809	35810	my dear	3120	” Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event . CHAPTER XI Mr. Elton must now be left to himself . It was no longer in Emma ’s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures . The coming of her sister ’s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected — she did not herself expect — that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers . They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . She hardly wished to have more leisure for them . There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves . Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella ’s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety . The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them . Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible . She could never see a fault in any of them . She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry . They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance . Mr. John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour . He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased . The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his . He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law . Nothing wrong in him escaped her . She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself . Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella ’s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . There he had not always the patience that could have been wished . Mr. Woodhouse ’s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed . It did not often happen ; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for Emma ’s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not . The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality . They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ’s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last . “
35812	35816	35809	35810	my dear	3120	” said he , “
35827	35828	35818	35819	Miss Taylor	80	” “
35834	35841	35818	35819	Miss Taylor	80	” cried she with ready sympathy , “
35889	35890	35887	35887	sir	3139	” “
35914	35933	35897	35897	I	0	” Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls . “
35966	35967	35962	35962	his	143	” “
35976	35982	35962	35962	his	143	” was the handsome reply . “
35994	36009	35985	35985	you	3139	” asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.—“Not
36022	36023	36026	36026	papa	3114	” “
36174	36175	36148	36148	Mr.	1091	” “
36182	36188	36148	36148	Mr.	1091	” said Mr. John Knightley , “
36267	36268	36262	36262	you	83	” “
36275	36278	36262	36262	you	83	” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes
36314	36315	36305	36305	she	84	” “
36336	36337	36332	36334	poor Mr. Weston	82	” “
36343	36349	36338	36338	I	0	” said John Knightley pleasantly , “
36429	36430	36431	36431	Me	0	” “
36436	36449	36431	36431	Me	0	” cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part . — “
36642	36643	36639	36640	Miss Taylor	80	” “
36650	36655	36639	36640	Miss Taylor	80	” said John Knightley . “
36669	36670	36657	36657	he	3228	” “
36678	36682	36671	36671	He	3228	” replied Emma . “
36711	36712	36707	36707	him	3228	” “
36725	36730	36731	36731	He	3228	” said her father . “
36795	36796	36784	36784	He	3228	” “
36815	36816	36801	36801	he	3228	” “
36926	36927	36934	36934	him	3228	” “
36936	36946	36934	36934	him	3228	” cried the good - hearted Mrs. John Knightley . “
37033	37034	37035	37035	Nobody	3124	” “
37047	37054	37041	37042	the Churchills	96	” observed Mr. John Knightley coolly . “
37162	37550	37571	37571	women	1136	” Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass . She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ’s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important.—It had a high claim to forbearance . CHAPTER XII Mr. Knightley was to dine with them — rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ’s first day . Emma ’s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation . She hoped they might now become friends again . She thought it was time to make up . Making - up indeed would not do . She certainly had not been in the wrong , and he would never own that he had . Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her — the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ’s arms . It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , “
37593	37594	37596	37596	you	0	” “
37642	37643	37609	37609	women	1136	” “

37664	37668	37609	37609	women	1136	” said he , smiling—“and
37682	37683	37672	37672	I	0	” “
37689	37691	37672	37672	I	0	” she replied—“and

37737	37738	37672	37672	I	0	” “

37847	37849	37837	37837	she	1145	” she cried—“very
37935	37936	37925	37926	Mr. Martin	112	” “
37945	37953	37925	37926	Mr. Martin	112	” was his short , full answer . “
37965	37984	37955	37955	I	0	” This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and “
37991	37993	37989	37989	George	119	” and “
38000	38339	37998	37998	you	88	” succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing — and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong . The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness . While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . “
38345	38371	37998	37998	you	88	” said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children—“How
38438	38507	38428	38428	Emma	79	” Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;—and two basins only were ordered . After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , “
38539	38540	38529	38529	I	0	” “
38580	38581	38557	38557	He	147	” “
38642	38643	38633	38633	I	0	” “
38648	38660	38661	38661	I	0	” cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , “
38716	38717	38711	38711	he	102	” “
38730	38731	38726	38726	he	102	” “
38810	38811	38813	38814	Mrs. Perry	100	” “
38856	38857	38845	38845	He	102	” “
38905	38906	38897	38897	him	102	” “
38966	38967	38951	38952	Mr. Wingfield	147	” “
39004	39017	39019	39019	Emma	79	“ You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , ”
39021	39031	39019	39019	Emma	79	“ I have not heard one inquiry after them . ”
39032	39101	39019	39019	Emma	79	“ Oh ! the good Bateses — I am quite ashamed of myself — but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs. Bates — I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.—They are always so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they , sir ? ”
39102	39128	39019	39019	Emma	79	“ Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago . ”
39129	39172	39019	39019	Emma	79	“ How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy — except when it has been quite an influenza . ”
39173	39227	39019	39019	Emma	79	“ That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . ”
39228	39244	39019	39019	Emma	79	“ No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly except — “
39297	39298	39303	39303	we	1182	” “
39410	39411	39395	39395	Wingfield	147	” “
39475	39476	39477	39477	I	0	” “
39608	39619	39603	39604	Mr. Knightley	88	” turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband . “
39642	39643	39633	39635	Mr. John Knightley	88	” “
39655	39666	39650	39650	you	0	” cried Mr. John Knightley , hearing his own name . “
39720	39721	39713	39714	Mr. Wingfield	147	” “
39724	39726	39730	39730	yourself	0	Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray
39754	39755	39756	39756	I	0	” “
39768	39772	39762	39762	you	0	” cried Emma , “
39808	39874	39801	39803	the old prejudice	1205	” And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ’s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising . “
39882	39886	39801	39803	the old prejudice	1205	” said Mrs. John Knightley.—“It
39980	39991	39970	39970	She	142	” Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , “
40025	40026	40027	40027	I	0	” “
40053	40221	40049	40049	Emma	79	” This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said — much praise and many comments — undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;—but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin . Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . Here was a dangerous opening . “
40224	40248	40049	40049	Emma	79	” said Mr. Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma ’s ear expressed , “
40273	40320	40321	40321	I	0	” And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with , “
40341	40342	40321	40321	I	0	” “
40364	40365	40346	40346	you	79	” “
40407	40408	40395	40395	Perry	102	” “
40492	40493	40472	40472	he	147	” “
40579	40580	40577	40577	Perry	102	” “
40608	40609	40616	40616	Perry	102	” “
40689	40727	40728	40729	Mr. Perry	102	” Emma ’s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ’s breaking out . “
40731	40743	40728	40729	Mr. Perry	102	” said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , “
40812	40830	40832	40833	Mr. Perry	102	” He paused — and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , “
40881	40882	40879	40879	himself	102	” “
40887	40895	40879	40879	himself	102	” cried Mr. Knightley , with most ready interposition—“very
41027	41728	41741	41741	her	1241	” Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it . CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister . She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly . It was a delightful visit;—perfect , in being much too short . In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas . Mr. Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party . How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter ’s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also . Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse ’s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing . The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house . Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears . Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard ’s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton ’s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard ’s door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid — of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield — they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together . Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ’s complaint;—“a
41779	41793	41758	41759	Mrs. Goddard	105	” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed , “
41846	41913	41842	41842	Perry	102	” Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard ’s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards — as if quite another subject , “
42076	42173	42053	42053	I	0	” Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her ’s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “
42181	42211	42212	42212	You	91	” and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening . “
42217	42219	42222	42222	your	91	” said she;—“we
42230	42321	42227	42228	Mrs. Weston	84	” But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton ’s only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing ; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . “
42324	42330	42227	42228	Mrs. Weston	84	” said she to herself , “
42484	42606	42607	42607	I	0	” Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard ’s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with — “
42656	42657	42658	42659	Mr. Elton	91	” “
42666	42670	42658	42659	Mr. Elton	91	” replied Emma ; “
42734	42735	42750	42750	he	91	” “
42738	42749	42750	42750	he	91	” said Mr. John Knightley presently , with some slyness , “
42764	42765	42766	42766	Me	0	” “
42768	42777	42779	42779	you	91	” she replied with a smile of astonishment , “
42789	42790	42779	42779	you	91	” “
42822	42823	42812	42812	you	79	” “
42833	42834	42824	42825	Mr. Elton	91	” “
42900	42901	42902	42902	I	0	” “
42928	43233	43234	43235	A man	548	” and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more . Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time . Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour . The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent . “
43237	43241	43249	43249	himself	548	” said he , “
43497	43524	43528	43528	my	0	” Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the “
43531	43685	43528	43528	my	0	” which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips . They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr. Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly . Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her . She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , “
43693	43694	43695	43695	My	0	” “
43702	43707	43698	43699	Mrs. Goddard	105	” said she presently , “
43722	43740	43719	43719	my	0	” His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . “
43830	43834	43806	43806	I	0	” Emma smiled and answered—“My
43881	43882	43869	43870	Mr. Perry	102	” “
43895	43896	43897	43897	He	102	” “
43943	43944	43897	43897	He	102	” “
43955	44007	43897	43897	He	102	” This was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . “
44013	44017	43897	43897	He	102	” said he , “
44107	44108	44104	44104	I	0	” “
44111	44116	44104	44104	I	0	” said John Knightley , “
44129	44130	44118	44118	I	0	” “
44134	44139	44104	44104	I	0	” observed Mr. Elton . “
44263	44283	44284	44284	I	0	” Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , “
44297	44335	44336	44336	We	1280	” At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton ’s spirits for other feelings . Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party . “
44343	44347	44336	44336	We	1280	” continued he , “
44495	44496	44497	44497	I	0	” “
44516	44517	44509	44509	I	0	” “
44571	44572	44573	44573	My	0	” “
44577	44591	44573	44573	My	0	” replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , “
44602	45085	44573	44573	My	0	” CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston ’s drawing - room;—Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill - humour . Mr. Elton must smile less , and Mr. John Knightley more , to fit them for the place.—Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was . To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons . Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ’s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each . This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day ’s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton ’s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost . The misfortune of Harriet ’s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ’s coming , and of Emma ’s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma . Emma ’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of “
45114	45267	45268	45269	my son	1306	insufferable!”—Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet ’s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton ’s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words “
45271	45273	45274	45274	Frank	98	” and “
45276	45278	45279	45280	my son	1306	” and “
45282	45651	45279	45280	my son	1306	” repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma ’s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her . She had frequently thought — especially since his father ’s marriage with Miss Taylor — that if she were to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ’ imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton ’s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross — and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her , “
45733	45763	45764	45764	He	98	” Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete . “
45773	45778	45764	45764	He	98	” continued Mr. Weston , “
45845	45846	45830	45830	I	0	” “
45880	45881	45871	45871	she	84	” “
46145	46146	46126	46126	she	1322	” “
46161	46165	46147	46147	I	0	” replied Emma ; “
46195	46196	46191	46191	you	1321	” “
46353	46433	46333	46333	she	1322	” Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy — yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming . — Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : “
46483	46484	46466	46467	Mr. Weston	82	” “
46515	46516	46499	46500	Mrs. Churchill	94	” “
46520	46527	46499	46500	Mrs. Churchill	94	” replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , “
46535	46546	46499	46500	Mrs. Churchill	94	” Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before—“You
46640	46641	46633	46633	her	94	” “
46653	46657	46650	46651	Mrs. Churchill	94	” replied Isabella : “
46734	46891	46728	46728	she	94	” Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . But at present there was nothing more to be said . Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room . To be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure . Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable . While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , “
46937	46938	46728	46728	she	94	” “
47045	47046	47039	47040	Mr. Weston	82	” “
47052	47056	47039	47040	Mr. Weston	82	” said Emma . “
47154	47155	47156	47156	One	475	” “
47180	47185	47186	47186	One	475	” replied Mrs. Weston . “
47239	47240	47242	47242	she	1346	” “
47319	47320	47321	47321	My	0	” “
47387	47396	47397	47397	I	0	” Emma listened , and then coolly said , “
47407	47408	47409	47409	He	1355	” “
47421	47426	47409	47409	He	1355	” continued Mrs. Weston , “
47467	47675	47677	47677	she	1361	” CHAPTER XV Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation . Mr. Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in . Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa . He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them . Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles . He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend — her fair , lovely , amiable friend . “
47708	47942	47945	47945	she	1363	” And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him . But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet’s — more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present — to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was vexed . It did appear — there was no concealing it — exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , “
48002	48003	47993	47993	she	1363	” “
48009	48013	48019	48019	herself	1363	” he continued , “
48080	48259	48070	48070	I	0	” Emma saw Mrs. Weston ’s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : “
48291	48360	48361	48361	I	0	” Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer . Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . “
48370	48374	48363	48363	your	1368	” said he , “
48473	48635	48460	48460	I	0	” Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away . As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . “
48650	48803	48804	48804	You	1380	” was Mr. Woodhouse ’s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time . To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little . His eldest daughter ’s alarm was equal to his own . The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them . “
48815	48819	48804	48804	You	1380	” said she ; “
48899	48900	48877	48877	you	1380	” “
48903	48907	48877	48877	you	1380	” replied he . “
48958	49272	49273	49273	Your	1388	” Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan . Mrs. Weston could only approve . Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr. Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother ’s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence . He had gone beyond the sweep — some way along the Highbury road — the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep — in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over . He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend . To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father ’s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls . He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus — “
49286	49287	49288	49288	I	0	” “
49297	49298	49288	49288	I	0	” “
49305	49306	49300	49300	I	0	” “
49311	49433	49434	49434	He	1389	” And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for . A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . “
49486	49934	49476	49476	They	1391	” and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage . Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tête - à - tête drive . It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . But now , she would rather it had not happened . She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston ’s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense . To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up — her hand seized — her attention demanded , and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping — fearing — adoring — ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . It really was so . Without scruple — without apology — without much apparent diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself her lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all . Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , “
49983	49984	49985	49986	Miss Smith!—message	163	” “
49993	50019	49991	49991	she	107	mean!”—And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , “
50080	50186	50197	50197	You	91	” But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects . He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer . As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , “
50294	50295	50296	50297	Good Heaven	165	” “
50299	50304	50296	50297	Good Heaven	165	” cried Mr. Elton , “
50482	50548	50475	50475	you	91	” It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this — which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton ’s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed — “
50570	50571	50564	50564	you	167	” “
50576	50580	50564	50564	you	167	” cried Emma , “
50726	50727	50718	50718	you	3139	” “
50732	50741	50730	50730	madam	1401	” cried he , affronted in his turn : “
50857	50858	50854	50854	I	0	” “
50990	51451	50981	50981	I	0	” He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane — turning a corner which he could never bear to think of — and in strange hands — a mere common coachman — no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem — if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel — perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of all . Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken — more in error — more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself . “
51483	51592	51481	51481	Harriet	107	” How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet — never ! She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion . She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it . His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled . The picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the charade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet . To be sure , the charade , with its “
51594	51597	51470	51470	He	758	wit”—but then the “
51599	52534	51481	51481	Harriet	107	eyes”—in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth . Who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ? Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ’s friend . To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility . There was no denying that those brothers had penetration . She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr. Elton ’s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service . She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes . He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . There had been no real affection either in his language or manners . Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . She need not trouble herself to pity him . He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten . But — that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ) , to marry him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking . Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind . The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family — and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If she had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that he , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers . The first error and the worst lay at her door . It was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple . She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . “
52539	52543	52537	52537	I	0	” said she , “
52752	53317	52747	52750	a pert young lawyer	1412	” She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ’s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him — that Harriet ’s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive — and that there could be no necessity for any body ’s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ’s being given a moment ’s uneasiness about it . These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present . The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church . Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton ’s absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them , — “
53335	53609	53611	53611	he	1414	” These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield . He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body . But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease . CHAPTER XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr. Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;—which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness . The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton ’s best compliments , “
53701	54830	53688	53689	Mr. Woodhouse	81	” Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr . Elton ’s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . She had not even a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not mentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ’s suspicion . It did , however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude . She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark . She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ’s return . She went to Mrs. Goddard ’s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding — to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred — and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame — and the sight of Harriet ’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . Harriet bore the intelligence very well — blaming nobody — and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend . Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ’s side , not her own . Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved him — and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible . Her tears fell abundantly — but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ’s eyes — and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding — really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two — and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ’s claims , was to promote Harriet ’s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts . Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ’s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton ’s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness — and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . If Mr. Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three . Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society . They must encounter each other , and make the best of it . Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard ’s ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself . CHAPTER XVIII Mr. Frank Churchill did not come . When the time proposed drew near , Mrs. Weston ’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . For the present , he could not be spared , to his “
54854	55295	54839	54839	he	1417	” Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed — much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . It soon flies over the present failure , and begins to hope again . For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ’s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner . These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs. Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself . Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill ’s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls . The acquaintance at present had no charm for her . She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston ’s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship . She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away . She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs. Weston ’s arguments against herself . “

57703	57903	57687	57687	He	1487	” said Mr. Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry . To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . VOLUME II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma ’s opinion , had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet ’s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—“Mr
57913	58259	57905	57905	Elton	91	” she found something else must be done . They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates . She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers . There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency — but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time — tiresome women — and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them . But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in — observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax . The house belonged to people in business . Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse ’s health , cheerful communications about her mother ’s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet—“Mrs
58330	58553	58312	58312	she	1507	” The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton . There was intimacy between them , and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his going away . Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ’ ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ’s being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties . She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece . “
58752	58768	58748	58748	she	101	” Emma ’s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest — “
58789	58790	58792	58792	you	176	” “
58799	58811	58794	58794	You	176	” replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh
59192	59221	59222	59222	You	1518	” All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax ’s handwriting . “
59227	59235	59222	59222	You	1518	” replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; “
59285	59289	59283	59283	Ma’am	179	” addressing her , “
59306	59382	59294	59295	Miss Woodhouse	90	” And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it . She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ’s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention . “
59529	59530	59532	59532	you	0	” “

60161	60204	60146	60146	Jane	142	” At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ’s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr. Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , “
60253	60254	60250	60251	Mrs. Campbell	154	” “
60484	60485	60481	60482	Mr. Dixon	182	” “

60672	60673	60651	60652	Miss Campbell	183	” “
60828	60829	60818	60818	Nobody	3124	” “
60842	60843	60818	60818	Nobody	3124	” “
61236	61237	61219	61219	she	142	” “
61247	61258	61259	61259	father	1574	” said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise—“My
61329	62867	62874	62874	her	1577	” And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded . She regained the street — happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax ’s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself . CHAPTER II Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates ’s youngest daughter . The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of the — — regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad — of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards — and this girl . By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the foundling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations . But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life . These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power . When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ’s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ’s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ’s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell ’s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ’s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was Jane Fairfax ’s history . She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ’s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters . Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . The evil day was put off . It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ’s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn . This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever . The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did . As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness:—what must be at last , had better be soon . Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment . She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ’s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it — Mr. Frank Churchill — must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ’ absence . Emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But “
62954	63634	63635	63635	She	1582	” These were her reasons — she had no better . It was a dislike so little just — every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ’ interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance . Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face — her features — there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it:—elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury . There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit . In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon ’s affections from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . These were charming feelings — but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , “
63646	64042	64044	64044	he	1583	” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane ’s offences rose again . They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion . Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon ’s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises . There probably was something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr. Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds . The like reserve prevailed on other topics . She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time . It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was . “
64045	64056	64148	64148	her;—but	1586	handsome?”—“She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . ”
64057	64060	64044	64044	he	1583	“ Was he agreeable?”—“He
64066	64067	64148	64148	her;—but	1586	” “
64080	64135	64069	64069	he	1583	information?”—“At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing . ”
64252	64258	64259	64259	he	88	“ A very pleasant evening , ”
64284	64381	64259	64259	he	88	away;—“particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma . You left nothing undone . I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ’s , it must have been a real indulgence . ”
64382	64389	64391	64391	Emma	79	“ I am happy you approved , ”
64395	64413	64391	64391	Emma	79	“ but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . ”
64414	64420	64422	64423	her father	415	“ No , my dear , ”
64426	64477	64422	64423	her father	415	“ that I am sure you are not . There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . If any thing , you are too attentive . The muffin last night — if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough . ”
64478	64481	64483	64484	Mr. Knightley	88	“ No , ”
64492	64516	64483	64484	Mr. Knightley	88	“ you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore . ”
64520	64526	64528	64528	she	79	expressed—“I understand you well enough ; ”
64532	64538	64528	64528	she	79	“ Miss Fairfax is reserved . ”
64539	64583	64422	64423	her father	415	“ I always told you she was — a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . What arises from discretion must be honoured . ”
64584	64596	64528	64528	she	79	“ You think her diffident . I do not see it . ”
64597	64602	64604	64604	he	88	“ My dear Emma , ”
64616	64636	64604	64604	he	88	“ you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . ”
64637	64663	64528	64528	she	79	“ Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained . ”
64664	64669	64604	64604	he	88	“ I am disappointed , ”
64675	64685	64691	64691	his	81	“ I hope every body had a pleasant evening , ”
64695	64816	64691	64691	his	81	“ I had . Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way . I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed . She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . ”
64817	64831	64834	64834	his	1591	“ True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . ”
64861	64896	64897	64898	Mr. Knightley	88	“ She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one ’s eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . ”
64933	65082	64920	64921	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished — but it is so little one can venture to do — small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon — Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate — Hartfield pork is not like any other pork — but still it is pork — and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork — I think we had better send the leg — do not you think so , my dear ? ”
65083	65134	64920	64921	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter . I knew you would wish it . There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . ”
65135	65220	64920	64921	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ That ’s right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . ”
65221	65224	65226	65227	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Emma , ”
65230	65260	65226	65227	Mr. Knightley	88	“ I have a piece of news for you . You like news — and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . ”
65261	65286	65287	65287	He	88	“ News ! Oh ! yes , I always like news . What is it?—why do you smile so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls ? ”
65294	65308	65287	65287	He	88	“ No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , ”
65368	65421	65345	65346	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse — I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . ”
65458	65469	65471	65472	Mr. Knightley	88	“ There is my news:—I thought it would interest you , ”
65491	65499	65501	65502	Miss Bates	101	“ But where could you hear it ? ”
65504	65711	65501	65502	Miss Bates	101	“ Where could you possibly hear it , Mr. Knightley ? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole ’s note — no , it can not be more than five — or at least ten — for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out — I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork — Jane was standing in the passage — were not you , Jane?—for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ‘ Shall I go down instead ? for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen . ’—‘Oh ! my dear , ’ said I — well , and just then came the note . A Miss Hawkins — that ’s all I know . A Miss Hawkins of Bath . But , Mr. Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . A Miss Hawkins — ”
65712	65747	65811	65812	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3935	“ I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago . He had just read Elton ’s letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly . ”
65748	65801	65811	65812	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3935	“ Well ! that is quite — I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . My dear sir , you really are too bountiful . My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her . ”
65802	65809	65811	65812	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3935	“ We consider our Hartfield pork , ”
65812	65837	65811	65812	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3935	Woodhouse—“indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I can not have a greater pleasure than — ”
65838	65918	65811	65812	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3935	“ Oh ! my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us . If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us . We may well say that ‘ our lot is cast in a goodly heritage . ’ Well , Mr. Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well — ”
65919	65936	65811	65812	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3935	“ It was short — merely to announce — but cheerful , exulting , of course . ”
65946	66000	65811	65812	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3935	“ He had been so fortunate as to — I forget the precise words — one has no business to remember them . The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled . ”
66001	66009	66011	66011	Emma	79	“ Mr. Elton going to be married ! ”
66020	66032	66011	66011	Emma	79	“ He will have every body ’s wishes for his happiness . ”
66033	66041	66043	66044	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ He is very young to settle , ”
66048	66079	66043	66044	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ He had better not be in a hurry . He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . ”
66080	66091	66093	66094	Miss Bates	101	“ A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! ”
66098	66145	66093	66094	Miss Bates	101	“ my mother is so pleased!—she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress . This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . ”
66162	66172	66173	66173	she	101	“ No — I have never seen Mr. Elton , ”
66181	66191	66173	66173	she	101	“ is he — is he a tall man ? ”
66192	66199	66201	66201	Emma	79	“ Who shall answer that question ? ”
66203	66263	66201	66201	Emma	79	“ My father would say ‘ yes , ’ Mr. Knightley ‘ no ; ’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . ”
66264	66486	66173	66173	she	101	“ Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man — But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry . Miss Hawkins,—I dare say , an excellent young woman . His extreme attention to my mother — wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know — it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it — the warm bath — but she says it did him no lasting benefit . Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel . And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . It is such a happiness when good people get together — and they always do . Now , here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys — I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry . I say , sir , ”
66492	66541	66489	66490	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ I think there are few places with such society as Highbury . I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.—My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork — a roast loin of pork — ”
66542	66563	66565	66565	Emma	79	“ As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , ”
66567	66595	66565	66565	Emma	79	“ nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . ”
66614	66680	66611	66611	Emma	79	“ You are silent , Miss Fairfax — but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ’s account — we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . ”
66681	66689	66691	66691	Jane	142	“ When I have seen Mr. Elton , ”
66693	66731	66691	66691	Jane	142	“ I dare say I shall be interested — but I believe it requires that with me . And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . ”
66732	66750	66752	66753	Miss Bates	101	“ Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , ”
66755	66935	66752	66753	Miss Bates	101	“ four weeks yesterday.—A Miss Hawkins!—Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever — Mrs. Cole once whispered to me — but I immediately said , ‘ No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man — but’—In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired — Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley . I mean in person — tall , and with that sort of look — and not very talkative . ”
66936	66951	66691	66691	Jane	142	“ Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . ”
66952	66995	66752	66753	Miss Bates	101	“ Very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . One takes up a notion , and runs away with it . Mr. Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? ”
66996	67017	66691	66691	Jane	142	“ Handsome ! Oh ! no — far from it — certainly plain . I told you he was plain . ”
67018	67040	66691	66691	Jane	142	“ My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself — ”
67041	67085	66752	66753	Miss Bates	101	“ Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking . But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain . ”
67086	67282	67283	67283	Emma	79	“ Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole ’s ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly — I would not have you out in a shower!—We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very!—I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!—Good morning to you . ”
67496	67509	67473	67473	Harriet	107	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! ”
67557	67695	67698	67706	the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper	1600	“ She had set out from Mrs. Goddard ’s half an hour ago — she had been afraid it would rain — she had been afraid it would pour down every moment — but she thought she might get to Hartfield first — she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford’s . ”—Ford
67723	68390	67698	67706	the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper	1600	place.—“And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps — when , all of a sudden , who should come in — to be sure it was so very odd!—but they always dealt at Ford’s — who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door — Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door!—Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.—Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse — well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me—(do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came forward — came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to try to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said — I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away — and then — only think!—I found he was coming up towards me too — slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered — and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n’t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole ’s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables — I believe I did — but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . ”
68601	68611	68613	68613	she	79	“ It might be distressing , for the moment , ”
68615	68654	68655	68655	Harriet	107	“ but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over — and may never — can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . ”
68658	68662	68664	68664	she	107	“ very true , ”
68665	68672	68675	68675	she	107	“ would not think about it ; ”
71597	71605	71596	71598	neither “ master	4003	“ master nor mistress was at home ; ”
71623	71629	71631	71631	Emma	79	“ This is too bad , ”
71638	71659	71631	71631	Emma	79	“ And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so disappointed . ”
71751	71883	71744	71745	Mr. Weston	82	“ How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father — glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow — I had a letter this morning — we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty — he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . ”
72056	72066	72068	72068	he	82	“ I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , ”
72092	72102	72104	72104	she	3168	“ We had better move on , Mr. Weston , ”
72106	72113	72104	72104	she	3168	“ we are detaining the girls . ”
72114	72121	72077	72077	she	79	“ Well , well , I am ready;”—and
72127	72157	72077	72077	she	79	“ but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man ; you have only had my account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:”—though
72189	72205	72207	72208	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o’clock , ”
72224	72236	72238	72239	Mr. Weston	82	“ Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three , ”
72323	72334	72302	72302	she	79	“ Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”—was
72412	72418	72419	72419	she	1682	“ My dear , dear anxious friend,”—said
72433	72471	72419	72419	she	1682	“ always overcareful for every body ’s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . ”
72483	72537	72538	72538	She	1682	“ ’ Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon . ”
72786	72792	72794	72795	Mr. Weston	82	“ I told you yesterday , ”
72799	72873	72794	72795	Mr. Weston	82	“ I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ’s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . ”
72874	72887	72889	72891	the young man	3228	“ It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it , ”
72893	72920	72889	72891	the young man	3228	“ though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing . ”
73113	73147	73079	73079	He	3228	inquiries,—“Was she a horsewoman?—Pleasant rides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large neighbourhood?—Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough?—There were several very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls — had they balls?—Was it a musical society ? ”
73296	73302	73303	73303	he	3228	“ His father ’s marriage , ”
73306	73344	73303	73303	he	3228	“ had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him . ”
73431	73442	73444	73444	he	3228	“ Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , ”
73446	73491	73444	73444	he	3228	“ but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . ”
73492	73507	73509	73509	Emma	79	“ You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , ”
73511	73558	73509	73509	Emma	79	“ were you to guess her to be eighteen , I should listen with pleasure ; but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Do n’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . ”
73559	73567	73568	73568	he	1706	“ I hope I should know better , ”
73571	73608	73568	73568	he	1706	“ no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . ”
73933	73969	73929	73930	Mr. Weston	82	move.—“He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford ’s , but he need not hurry any body else . ”
73987	74105	73929	73930	Mr. Weston	82	“ As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name — I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ? ”
74106	74113	74115	74116	his father	3213	“ To be sure we do , ”
74118	74169	73929	73930	Mr. Weston	82	“ Mrs. Bates — we passed her house — I saw Miss Bates at the window . True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is . Call upon her , by all means . ”
74170	74181	74183	74185	the young man	3228	“ There is no necessity for my calling this morning , ”
74187	74206	74183	74185	the young man	3228	“ another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which — ”
74207	74312	74313	74314	The son	3169	“ Oh ! go to - day , go to - day . Do not defer it . What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided . You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . If you do not call early it will be a slight . ”
74318	74328	74330	74330	Emma	79	“ I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , ”
74332	74341	74330	74330	Emma	79	“ she is a very elegant young woman . ”
74352	74355	74358	74358	her	79	“ Yes , ”
74394	74406	74408	74408	she	79	“ If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , ”
74410	74456	74408	74408	she	79	“ I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her — no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . ”
74457	74471	74473	74474	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? ”
74486	74558	74473	74474	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . ”
74559	74577	74408	74408	she	79	“ My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . ”
74578	74651	74652	74654	Mr. Frank Churchill	98	“ But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . ”
74677	74721	74667	74668	his father	3213	“ My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates ’s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . ”
74850	74894	74897	74898	Mrs. Weston	84	Highbury.—“He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . ”—Highbury
75909	75914	75891	75891	Emma	79	“ Yes , oh ! yes”—he
75917	76078	75891	75891	Emma	79	“ I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him — but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . ”
76079	76089	76158	76158	Emma	79	“ And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? ”
76090	76157	75891	75891	Emma	79	“ Ill , very ill — that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most deplorable want of complexion . ”
76176	76218	76219	76219	He	1759	“ It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . ”
76296	76299	76301	76301	Emma	79	“ Well , ”
76303	76318	76301	76301	Emma	79	“ there is no disputing about taste.—At least you admire her except her complexion . ”
76324	76334	76321	76321	his	1759	laughed.—“I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion . ”
76335	76352	76321	76321	his	1759	“ Did you see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in the same society ? ”
76367	76470	76363	76363	he	1759	“ Ha ! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford ’s . If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford ’s . It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say they sell gloves . ”
76471	76530	76531	76531	They	1764	“ Oh ! yes , gloves and every thing . I do admire your patriotism . You will be adored in Highbury . You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr. Weston ’s son — but lay out half a guinea at Ford ’s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . ”
76545	76549	76321	76321	his	1759	“ Men ’s Beavers ”
76551	76554	76321	76321	his	1759	“ York Tan ”
76565	76627	76363	76363	he	1759	said—“But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae . Do not let me lose it . I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life . ”
76628	76647	76363	76363	he	1759	“ I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . ”
76648	76705	76564	76564	he	1765	“ And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . It is always the lady ’s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow . ”
76706	76768	76363	76363	he	1759	“ Upon my word ! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her . ”
76769	76840	76363	76363	he	1759	“ May I , indeed?—Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . I met her frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs. Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman . I like them all . ”
76841	76861	76564	76564	he	1765	“ You know Miss Fairfax ’s situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? ”
76862	76869	76363	76363	he	1759	“ Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do . ”
76870	76879	76881	76882	Mrs. Weston	84	“ You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , ”
76885	76918	76881	76882	Mrs. Weston	84	“ remember that I am here.—Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax ’s situation in life . I will move a little farther off . ”
76919	76929	76931	76931	Emma	79	“ I certainly do forget to think of her , ”
76933	76948	76931	76931	Emma	79	“ as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . ”
76976	76991	76993	76994	Frank Churchill	98	“ Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? ”
76996	77001	77003	77003	Emma	79	“ Ever hear her ! ”
77005	77033	76993	76994	Frank Churchill	98	“ You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly . ”
77034	77195	76953	76953	he	1766	“ You think so , do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ’s performance.—I have been used to hear her ’s admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman — engaged to her — on the point of marriage — would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead — never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof . ”
77196	77200	77202	77202	Emma	79	“ Proof indeed ! ”
77205	77242	77202	77202	Emma	79	amused.—“Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . ”
77243	77264	76953	76953	he	1766	“ Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . ”
77265	77339	76953	76953	he	1766	“ Certainly — very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if I had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . I could not excuse a man ’s having more music than love — more ear than eye — a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ? ”
77340	77351	76953	76953	he	1766	“ It was her very particular friend , you know . ”
77352	77356	77358	77358	Emma	79	“ Poor comfort ! ”
77362	77424	77358	77358	Emma	79	“ One would rather have a stranger preferred than one ’s very particular friend — with a stranger it might not recur again — but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . ”
77425	77449	76953	76953	he	1766	“ You are right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it . ”
77450	77514	76953	76953	he	1766	“ So much the better — or so much the worse:—I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her — quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling — there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . ”
77515	77524	76953	76953	he	1766	“ As to that — I do not — ”
77525	77585	76953	76953	he	1766	“ Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ’s sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses . ”
77586	77598	77599	77599	he	1769	“ There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all — ”
77610	77685	77599	77599	he	1769	“ however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were — how it might all be behind the scenes . I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be . ”
77686	77802	76953	76953	he	1766	“ I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve — I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . ”
77803	77813	77815	77815	he	1770	“ It is a most repulsive quality , indeed , ”
77817	77847	77815	77815	he	1770	“ Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in reserve , but no attraction . One can not love a reserved person . ”
77848	77965	77966	77966	He	1770	“ Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ’s reserve to procure one . Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question . I have no reason to think ill of her — not the least — except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . ”
78570	78580	78554	78554	her	84	“ all young people would have their little whims . ”
78881	78891	78877	78878	Mrs. Weston	84	“ all young people would have their little whims . ”
79013	79027	79002	79002	himself	88	“ Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . ”
79512	79532	79505	79506	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , ”
79722	79730	79712	79712	her	107	“ of course it must be declined , ”
79802	79854	79859	79859	she	107	“ They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . ”
79969	79979	80147	80148	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I am not fond of dinner - visiting , ”
79981	80143	80147	80148	Mrs. Weston	84	he—“I never was . No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us — take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . ”
80155	80175	80147	80148	Mrs. Weston	84	reproach—“Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . ”
80176	80181	80183	80184	Mr. Weston	82	“ Well , sir , ”
80186	80224	80183	80184	Mr. Weston	82	“ as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . ”
80285	80336	80274	80275	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole . ”
80337	80504	80244	80245	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my compliments , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him . We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . ”
80505	80522	80274	80275	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? ”
80523	80556	80274	80275	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise . ”
80557	80564	80566	80567	Mr. Weston	82	“ But , my dear sir , ”
80569	80584	80566	80567	Mr. Weston	82	“ if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . ”
80585	80594	80596	80597	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ And no great harm if it does , ”
80599	80610	80596	80597	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ The sooner every party breaks up , the better . ”
80611	80725	80274	80275	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma ’s going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ’s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ’s in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these ten years . ”
80726	80871	80596	80597	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious — Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . ”
80872	80986	80274	80275	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time — and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up . ”
81196	81326	81189	81189	Emma	79	“ I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.—It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr. Knightley , he is not a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.—No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . ”
81687	81696	81698	81698	she	79	“ This is coming as you should do , ”
81700	81711	81698	81698	she	79	“ like a gentleman.—I am quite glad to see you . ”
81718	81773	81712	81712	He	88	“ How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . ”
81774	81894	81712	81712	He	88	“ Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . Now you have nothing to try for . You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than any body else . Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . ”
81895	81899	81901	81901	his	1843	“ Nonsensical girl ! ”
82357	82364	82366	82367	Mrs. Cole	176	“ One can suppose nothing else , ”
82369	82439	82366	82367	Mrs. Cole	176	“ and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her . ”
82501	82769	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought — or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . ”
82799	82805	82807	82807	she	176	“ Why do you smile ? ”
82809	82816	82807	82807	she	176	“ Nay , why do you ? ”
82817	82839	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell ’s being so rich and so liberal.—It is a handsome present . ”
82840	82843	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ Very . ”
82844	82855	82807	82807	she	176	“ I rather wonder that it was never made before . ”
82856	82869	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . ”
82870	82899	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument — which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . ”
82900	82920	82807	82807	she	176	“ That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates ’s house . ”
82921	82945	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ You may say what you chuse — but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine . ”
82946	83008	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ I do not know . I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve . I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ? ”
83009	83018	82807	82807	she	176	“ What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? ”
83019	83097	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ’s scheme than an elderly man ’s . It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say . I told you that your suspicions would guide mine . ”
83098	83114	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon in them . ”
83115	83159	82807	82807	she	176	“ Mr. Dixon.—Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . ”
83160	83400	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with her , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ’s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her ’s . I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are . ”
83401	83436	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . Mr. Dixon ’s preference of her music to her friend ’s , I can answer for being very decided . ”
83437	83468	82807	82807	she	176	“ And then , he saved her life . Did you ever hear of that?—A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . He caught her . ”
83469	83482	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ He did . I was there — one of the party . ”
83483	83517	82770	82771	Miss Woodhouse	80	“ Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries . ”
83518	83624	82807	82807	she	176	“ I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.—It was the work of a moment . And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable — indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again — yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . ”
83691	83736	83688	83688	Emma	79	“ The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . ”
83737	83759	83943	83943	he	1864	“ And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells . ”
83760	83830	83943	83943	he	1864	“ No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business . ”
83831	83927	83688	83688	Emma	79	“ Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . ”
84328	84335	84336	84337	Mrs. Weston	84	“ my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . ”
84536	84553	84555	84555	she	79	“ He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naïveté . ”
84557	84585	84555	84555	she	79	“ Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . ”
85055	85064	85066	85066	he	98	“ I have made a most wretched discovery , ”
85074	85124	85066	85066	he	98	“ I have been here a week to - morrow — half my time . I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!—I hate the recollection . ”
85125	85151	85066	85066	he	98	“ Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut . ”
85152	85155	85157	85157	he	98	“ No , ”
85161	85190	85157	85157	he	98	“ that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . ”
85256	85262	85264	85264	she	79	“ What is the matter ? ”
85269	85276	85277	85277	he	98	“ Thank you for rousing me , ”
85280	85376	85277	85277	he	98	“ I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way — so very odd a way — that I can not keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I?—Yes , I will — I declare I will — and you shall see how she takes it;—whether she colours . ”
85445	85455	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	“ This is the luxury of a large party , ”
85457	85517	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	she:—“one can get near every body , and say every thing . My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you . I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh . Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ? ”
85518	85527	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	“ How?—They were invited , were not they ? ”
85528	85544	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Oh ! yes — but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their coming ? ”
85545	85558	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	“ They walked , I conclude . How else could they come ? ”
85559	85872	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Very true.—Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . Poor girl ! I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage . You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ‘ Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!’—but with many , many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr. Knightley ’s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again . ’ I was quite surprized;—very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention — and so thoughtful an attention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of . And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . ”
85873	85877	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Very likely , ”
85879	86002	85442	85443	Mrs. Weston	84	Emma—“nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing — to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ’s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to - day — for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . ”
86003	86006	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Well , ”
86013	86098	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax . See the consequence of keeping you company!—What do you say to it ? ”
86099	86106	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! ”
86110	86184	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?—Mr . Knightley!—Mr . Knightley must not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh ! no , no , Henry must have Donwell . I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley ’s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . ”
86185	86263	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match — I do not want to injure dear little Henry — but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ’s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? ”
86264	86308	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr . Knightley marry!—No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women ! ”
86309	86328	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . ”
86329	86338	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ But the imprudence of such a match ! ”
86339	86352	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . ”
86353	86469	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax — and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!—Oh ! no , no;—every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing . ”
86470	86500	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Imprudent , if you please — but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . ”
86501	86590	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry?—He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother ’s children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . ”
86591	86615	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax — ”
86616	86654	86008	86009	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but — ”
86655	86658	86660	86661	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Well , ”
86665	86685	86660	86661	Mrs. Weston	84	“ perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home . ”
86686	86812	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! ’ And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ’s old petticoat . ‘ Not that it was such a very old petticoat either — for still it would last a great while — and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ’ ”
86813	87065	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he takes in her — his anxiety about her health — his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me — this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody — though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ? I can not help suspecting him . I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . ”
87066	87104	86660	86661	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously . ”
87105	87138	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . ”
87139	87160	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . ”
87161	87202	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner . ”
87203	87261	86108	86108	Emma	79	“ You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment — I believe nothing of the pianoforte — and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . ”
87868	87874	87876	87876	she	79	“ I often feel concern , ”
87878	87923	87876	87876	she	79	“ that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose . ”
87924	87937	87938	87938	he	88	“ Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , ”
87939	87950	87952	87952	he	88	replied;—“but you must often wish it , I am sure . ”
87969	87976	87952	87952	he	88	“ This present from the Campbells , ”
87978	87985	87876	87876	she	79	she—“this pianoforte is very kindly given . ”
87986	87989	87990	87990	he	88	“ Yes , ”
87998	88040	87990	87990	he	88	embarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her notice of it . Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell . ”
88100	88105	88107	88107	he	88	“ That will do , ”
88115	88128	88107	88107	he	88	aloud—“you have sung quite enough for one evening — now be quiet . ”
88139	88159	88107	88107	he	88	“ One more;—they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more . ”
88168	88196	88161	88162	Frank Churchill	98	“ I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . The strength of the song falls on the second . ”
88202	88206	88208	88208	he	88	“ That fellow , ”
88212	88228	88208	88208	he	88	“ thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . This must not be . ”
88239	88269	88270	88271	Miss Bates	101	near—“Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? Go , and interfere . They have no mercy on her . ”
88647	88654	88656	88657	Frank Churchill	98	“ Perhaps it is as well , ”
88667	88689	88660	88660	he	98	“ I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after yours . ”
88960	88976	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! ”
88977	89002	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Do n’t class us together , Harriet . My playing is no more like her ’s , than a lamp is like sunshine . ”
89003	89049	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Oh ! dear — I think you play the best of the two . I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . ”
89050	89091	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax ’s is much beyond it . ”
89092	89154	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . ”
89155	89167	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . ”
89168	89261	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it . And I hate Italian singing.—There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ? ”
89262	89272	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Just as they always do — very vulgar . ”
89273	89279	89281	89281	Harriet	107	“ They told me something , ”
89285	89294	89281	89281	Harriet	107	“ but it is nothing of any consequence . ”
89314	89328	89311	89312	Mr. Elton	91	“ They told me — that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday . ”
89329	89332	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Oh ! ”
89333	89352	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner . ”
89353	89356	89311	89312	Mr. Elton	91	“ Oh ! ”
89357	89395	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox . I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer . ”
89396	89413	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . ”
89414	89449	89311	89312	Mr. Elton	91	“ She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . He sat by her at dinner . Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . ”
89450	89467	88938	88938	Harriet	107	“ Very likely.—I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . ”
89822	89829	89831	89831	she	79	“ For my companion tells me , ”
89833	89881	89831	89831	she	79	“ that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now . ”
89882	89899	89901	89902	Frank Churchill	98	“ And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , ”
89904	89922	89901	89902	Frank Churchill	98	“ to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield — if you are going home . ”
89928	89945	89923	89924	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased . ”
89946	90019	89831	89831	she	79	“ Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps — I may be equally in the way here . Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ? ”
90020	90031	90033	90033	Emma	79	“ I am here on no business of my own , ”
90035	90071	90033	90033	Emma	79	“ I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument . ”
90072	90151	89831	89831	she	79	“ Well — if you advise it.—But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone — what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . ”
90152	90161	89831	89831	she	79	“ I do not believe any such thing , ”
90163	90207	89831	89831	she	79	Emma.—“I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax ’s opinion last night . ”
90208	90214	90216	90217	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Do come with me , ”
90219	90276	90216	90217	Mrs. Weston	84	“ if it be not very disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long . We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to call with me . It will be felt so great an attention ! and I always thought you meant it . ”
90380	90392	90394	90395	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	218	“ Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard ’s , ma’am ? ”
90395	90483	90394	90395	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	218	Ford.—“Yes — no — yes , to Mrs. Goddard ’s . Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield . No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please . But then , Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the pattern gown home any day . But I shall want the ribbon directly — so it had better go to Hartfield — at least the ribbon . You could make it into two parcels , Mrs. Ford , could not you ? ”
90484	90503	90394	90395	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	218	“ It is not worth while , Harriet , to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels . ”
90504	90510	90394	90395	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	218	“ No more it is . ”
90511	90520	90522	90525	the obliging Mrs. Ford	200	“ No trouble in the world , ma’am , ”
90527	90595	90522	90525	the obliging Mrs. Ford	200	“ Oh ! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one . Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s — I do not know — No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night . What do you advise ? ”
90596	90620	90394	90395	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	218	“ That you do not give another half - second to the subject . To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs. Ford . ”
90621	90630	90632	90632	Harriet	107	“ Aye , that will be much best , ”
90637	90653	90632	90632	Harriet	107	“ I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard ’s . ”
90678	90684	90686	90687	the latter	1955	“ My dear Miss Woodhouse , ”
90689	90755	90686	90687	the latter	1955	“ I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith . How do you do , Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding . ”
90756	90766	90664	90665	two ladies	1954	“ I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are — ”
90767	91362	91363	91363	Emma	79	“ Very well , I am much obliged to you . My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night . How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad to hear such a good account . Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh ! then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her — and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.—‘Aye , pray do , ’ said Mr. Frank Churchill , ‘ Miss Woodhouse ’s opinion of the instrument will be worth having . ’—But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh , ’ said he , ‘ wait half a minute , till I have finished my job;’—For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ’s spectacles.—The rivet came out , you know , this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had no use of her spectacles — could not put them on . And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress ’s spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always — I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present — and she really eats nothing — makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats — so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before — I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us . ”
91366	91378	91363	91363	Emma	79	“ very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , ”
91399	91464	91395	91396	Miss Bates	101	“ How do you do , Mrs. Ford ? I beg your pardon . I did not see you before . I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . Jane came back delighted yesterday . Thank ye , the gloves do very well — only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in . ”
91465	91472	91474	91474	she	79	“ What was I talking of ? ”
91500	92418	92419	92420	Miss Bates	101	“ I declare I can not recollect what I was talking of.—Oh ! my mother ’s spectacles . So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill ! ‘ Oh ! ’ said he , ‘ I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . ’—Which you know shewed him to be so very .... Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .... I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could .... ‘ Oh ! ’ said he , ‘ I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively . ’ I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ‘ Oh ! ’ said he directly , ‘ there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life . ’ That , you know , was so very .... And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice — only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times — but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell — some of Mr. Knightley ’s most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees — I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day — for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ‘ I am sure you must be , ’ said he , ‘ and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing . ’ So I begged he would not — for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left — it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me — No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of that sort his master had ; he had brought them all — and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ’s profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very .... I wanted to keep it from Jane ’s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . ”
92456	92527	92450	92450	her	101	“ Pray take care , Mrs. Weston , there is a step at the turning . Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase — rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss Smith , pray take care . Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning . ”
92619	92625	92627	92627	he	1963	“ This is a pleasure , ”
92635	92664	92627	92627	he	1963	“ coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . ”
92665	92668	92670	92671	Mrs. Weston	84	“ What ! ”
92673	92697	92670	92671	Mrs. Weston	84	“ have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . ”
92698	92706	92707	92707	he	1963	“ I have not been working uninterruptedly , ”
92710	92774	92775	92775	He	1963	“ I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe . You see we have been wedging one leg with paper . This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . ”
92962	92969	92971	92972	Frank Churchill	98	“ Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , ”
92980	93052	92971	92972	Frank Churchill	98	“ the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ’s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not you think so ? ”
93078	93084	93086	93086	Emma	79	“ It is not fair , ”
93092	93104	93086	93086	Emma	79	“ mine was a random guess . Do not distress her . ”
93133	93235	93129	93129	he	1966	“ How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax . I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument ’s coming to hand . Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? ”
93251	93261	93263	93263	she	1967	“ Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell , ”
93272	93287	93263	93263	she	1967	“ I can imagine nothing with any confidence . It must be all conjecture . ”
93288	93395	93396	93396	He	1968	“ Conjecture — aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm . What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all;—your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word — Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing . There , it is done . I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . ”
93438	93445	93447	93447	he	1968	“ If you are very kind , ”
93449	93515	93516	93516	She	142	“ it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;—let me live them over again . You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds — all the worlds one ever has to give — for another half - hour . ”
93519	93543	93544	93544	She	142	“ What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth . ”
93579	93674	93561	93561	He	1968	“ Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here are a new set of Irish melodies . That , from such a quarter , one might expect . This was all sent with the instrument . Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . True affection only could have prompted it . ”
93778	93789	93758	93758	He	1968	“ You speak too plain . She must understand you . ”
93790	93814	93758	93758	He	1968	“ I hope she does . I would have her understand me . I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . ”
93815	93834	93758	93758	He	1968	“ But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea . ”
93835	93880	93758	93758	He	1968	“ I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . Leave shame to her . If she does wrong , she ought to feel it . ”
93881	93892	93758	93758	He	1968	“ She is not entirely without it , I think . ”
93893	93915	93758	93758	He	1968	“ I do not see much sign of it . She is playing Robin Adair at this moment — his favourite . ”
93937	94008	94009	94009	She	101	“ Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother ’s room you know . I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . Quite delightful to have you all meet so!—Our little room so honoured ! ”
94057	94109	94133	94133	he	88	“ How d ’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here . ”
94136	94182	94133	94133	he	88	“ How is your niece , Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold last night . How is she to - day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . ”
94229	94243	94245	94246	Miss Bates	101	“ So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage , ”
94254	94269	94248	94248	He	88	“ I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ? ”
94270	94292	94248	94248	He	88	“ Oh ! dear , Kingston — are you?—Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . ”
94293	94309	94248	94248	He	88	“ Mrs. Cole has servants to send . Can I do any thing for you ? ”
94310	94357	94248	94248	He	88	“ No , I thank you . But do come in . Who do you think is here?—Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in . ”
94358	94361	94363	94363	he	88	“ Well , ”
94370	94377	94363	94363	he	88	“ for five minutes , perhaps . ”
94378	94395	94248	94248	He	88	“ And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful ; so many friends ! ”
94396	94425	94248	94248	He	88	“ No , not now , I thank you . I could not stay two minutes . I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can . ”
94426	94443	94248	94248	He	88	“ Oh ! do come in . They will be so very happy to see you . ”
94444	94466	94248	94248	He	88	“ No , no ; your room is full enough . I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . ”
94467	94511	94248	94248	He	88	“ Well , I am so sorry!—Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . ”
94512	94619	94248	94248	He	88	“ Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England . Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it . ”
94620	94646	94248	94248	He	88	“ Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence — so shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples ! ”
94647	94654	94248	94248	He	88	“ What is the matter now ? ”
94655	94788	94248	94248	He	88	“ To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked ! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins mentioned it here . You should not have done it , indeed you should not . Ah ! he is off . He never can bear to be thanked . But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .... Well , ( returning to the room , ) I have not been able to succeed . Mr. Knightley can not stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing .... ”
94789	94792	94794	94794	Jane	142	“ Yes , ”
94796	94808	94794	94794	Jane	142	“ we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . ”
94809	94894	94248	94248	He	88	“ Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ‘ Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ’ said he ; so I just mentioned .... Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?—You seem but just come — so very obliging of you . ”
95333	95354	95530	95531	Somebody else	1926	“ You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five , ”
95362	95425	95530	95531	Somebody else	1926	“ And there will be the two Gilberts , young Cox , my father , and myself , besides Mr. Knightley . Yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure . You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room . ”
95436	95453	95530	95531	Somebody else	1926	“ But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think there will . ”
95457	95509	95510	95510	Somebody	3299	“ And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it . It will not do to invite five couple . It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment . ”
95629	95643	95666	95666	Emma	79	“ Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? ”
95712	95717	95719	95719	he	81	“ Oh ! no , ”
95721	95861	95719	95719	he	81	“ it would be the extreme of imprudence . I could not bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So would poor little Harriet . So you would all . Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . Pray do not let them talk of it . That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of the draught . I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! ”
95962	95968	95970	95970	he	98	“ We were too magnificent , ”
95972	95986	95970	95970	he	98	“ We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well . ”
95990	96014	95970	95970	he	98	“ It would be a crowd — a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? ”
96015	96019	96020	96020	he	98	“ Very true , ”
96024	96030	96020	96020	he	98	“ it was very bad . ”
96044	96057	96040	96040	he	98	“ I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . ”
96058	96063	96065	96065	she	79	“ No , no , ”
96067	96105	96065	96065	she	79	“ you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd — and a crowd in a little room ! ”
96106	96113	96114	96114	he	98	“ There is no denying it , ”
96117	96199	96114	96114	he	98	“ I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room — Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite!—Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father — and altogether — I do not know that — I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . ”
96334	96340	96341	96341	he	98	“ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ”
96346	96429	96341	96341	he	98	“ your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father ’s little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a thought of my father ’s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? ”
96430	96434	96306	96306	he	98	“ The Crown ! ”
96435	96569	96306	96306	he	98	“ Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange?—You consent — I hope you consent ? ”
96570	96632	96633	96633	She	2009	“ It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not . I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy — It seems the only improvement that could be . Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ? ”
96664	96763	96306	96306	he	98	“ No ; he thought it very far from an improvement — a very bad plan — much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life — did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh ! no — a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . ”
96764	96773	96775	96776	Frank Churchill	98	“ I was going to observe , sir , ”
96778	96827	96775	96776	Frank Churchill	98	“ that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ’s catching cold — so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . ”
96828	96831	96833	96834	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Sir , ”
96839	96891	96833	96834	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character . Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ’s house . ”
96892	96954	96306	96306	he	98	“ From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all — not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . ”
96955	97012	96306	96306	he	98	“ Open the windows!—but surely , Mr. Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent ! I never heard of such a thing . Dancing with open windows!—I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . ”
97013	97051	96833	96834	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Ah ! sir — but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself . ”
97052	97155	96833	96834	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Have you indeed , sir?—Bless me ! I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over — but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One can not resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . ”
97156	97169	96306	96306	he	98	“ But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited — ”
97170	97173	97175	97175	Emma	79	“ Oh ! ”
97177	97228	97175	97175	Emma	79	“ there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable . ”
97229	97295	96306	96306	he	98	“ So they will , my dear . That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired — but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight . ”
97296	97327	96306	96306	he	98	“ I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston ’s care . Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . ”
97328	97405	96306	96306	he	98	“ There , papa!—Now you must be satisfied — Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ‘ If Miss Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . ’ How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! ”
97406	97509	96306	96306	he	98	“ Aye , very true . Mr. Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ’s great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort — which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella ’s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . ”
97510	97524	97526	97527	Frank Churchill	98	“ My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , ”
97529	97605	97526	97527	Frank Churchill	98	“ examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . ”
97687	97690	97692	97692	she	79	“ Emma , ”
97694	97730	97692	97692	she	79	“ this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined . ”
97731	97740	97742	97743	her husband	431	“ My dear , you are too particular , ”
97745	97784	97742	97743	her husband	431	“ What does all that signify ? You will see nothing of it by candlelight . It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight . We never see any thing of it on our club - nights . ”
97794	97805	97807	97808	the gentlemen	1743	“ Men never know when things are dirty or not ; ”
97815	97826	97813	97813	himself	1743	“ Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . ”
98076	98096	98059	98059	She	84	“ I do not think it is so very small . We shall not be many , you know . ”
98118	98151	98098	98099	Mr. Weston	82	“ You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs . ”
98152	98156	98158	98159	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I wish , ”
98161	98198	98158	98159	Mrs. Weston	84	“ one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object — if one could but tell what that would be . ”
98199	98205	98207	98207	Frank	98	“ Yes , very true , ”
98209	98308	98207	98207	Frank	98	“ very true . You want your neighbours ’ opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them — the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ? She is still nearer.—And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ? ”
98309	98316	98318	98319	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Well — if you please , ”
98323	98334	98318	98319	Mrs. Weston	84	“ if you think she will be of any use . ”
98335	98347	98349	98349	Emma	79	“ You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , ”
98351	98385	98349	98349	Emma	79	“ She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . ”
98386	98419	98318	98319	Mrs. Weston	84	“ But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know . ”
98439	98518	98435	98435	his	82	“ Aye , do , Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both . Invite them both . ”
98519	98528	98435	98435	his	82	“ Both sir ! Can the old lady ? ”
98530	98564	98435	98435	his	82	“ The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . ”
98565	98595	98435	98435	his	82	“ Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both . ”
98885	98903	98878	98879	Mr. Weston	82	“ He has asked her , my dear . That ’s right . I knew he would ! ”
99169	99303	99159	99159	Emma	79	“ Very well . If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh ! yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins ’s week ’s account ; much rather , I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not I , indeed — I never look at it — I do not know who does.—Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . ”
99375	99413	99370	99370	she	79	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment it would be ! I do look forward to it , I own , with very great pleasure . ”
99663	99709	99659	99660	Mrs. Weston	84	“ that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . ”
99783	99790	99796	99797	Her father	415	happiest!—“I said it would be so , ”
99926	99939	99918	99918	himself	2064	“ Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst . ”
99940	99947	99949	99949	Emma	79	“ But you will come again , ”
99951	99962	99949	99949	Emma	79	“ This will not be your only visit to Randalls . ”
99963	100027	99918	99918	himself	2064	“ Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring — but I am afraid — they did not stir last spring — I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever . ”
100028	100038	99918	99918	himself	2064	“ Our poor ball must be quite given up . ”
100039	100082	99949	99949	Emma	79	“ Ah ! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ? ”
100083	100107	99918	99918	himself	2064	“ Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance . I would much rather have been merry than wise . ”
100108	100135	100136	100136	Emma	79	“ If I can come again , we are still to have our ball . My father depends on it . Do not forget your engagement . ”
100140	100149	100150	100150	he	2065	“ Such a fortnight as it has been ! ”
100153	100185	100150	100150	he	2065	“ every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making me less fit to bear any other place . Happy those , who can remain at Highbury ! ”
100186	100196	100198	100198	Emma	79	“ As you do us such ample justice now , ”
100202	100266	100267	100267	He	2065	“ I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? Do not we rather surpass your expectations ? I am sure we do . I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury . ”
100287	100297	100278	100278	Emma	79	“ And you must be off this very morning ? ”
100298	100333	100150	100150	he	2065	“ Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . ”
100334	100365	100267	100267	He	2065	“ Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ? How unlucky ! Miss Bates ’s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours . ”
100366	100457	100278	100278	Emma	79	“ Yes — I have called there ; passing the door , I thought it better . It was a right thing to do . I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ’s being absent . She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one must laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . It was better to pay my visit , then ”
100470	100474	100476	100476	he	2066	“ In short , ”
100478	100493	100476	100476	he	2066	“ perhaps , Miss Woodhouse — I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion ”
100550	100568	100546	100546	she	2067	“ You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then ”
100646	100672	100633	100633	he	2066	“ It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield . My regard for Hartfield is most warm ”
100775	100782	100784	100786	the young man	3228	“ It was time to go ; ”
100804	100812	100814	100814	he	2066	“ I shall hear about you all , ”
100816	100890	100814	100814	he	2066	“ that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you . I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it . Oh ! the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing . In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again . ”
100902	100907	100814	100814	he	2066	“ Good - bye , ”
101146	101151	101153	101153	she	79	“ I certainly must , ”
101155	101266	101153	101153	she	79	“ This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ’s being dull and insipid about the house ! — I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not — for a few weeks at least . Well ! evil to some is always good to others . I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will be happy . He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes . ”
101327	101355	101303	101303	he	88	“ You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! ”
101758	101772	101847	101847	she	2074	“ I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice , ”
101774	101842	101847	101847	she	2074	she.—“In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness . So much the better . I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do . I am quite enough in love . I should be sorry to be more . ”
101858	102099	101847	101847	she	2074	“ He is undoubtedly very much in love — every thing denotes it — very much in love indeed!—and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto . No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.—Still , however , I must be on my guard . This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man — I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.—His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable.—Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do very well again after a little while — and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily . ”
102363	102393	102404	102404	herself	79	words—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse ’s beautiful little friend . Pray make my excuses and adieus to her . ”
102558	102563	102557	102561	the “ beautiful little friend	4510	“ beautiful little friend , ”
102632	102640	102622	102622	Harriet	107	“ I must not dwell upon it , ”
102642	102703	102622	102622	Harriet	107	she.—“I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure . ”
102819	102825	102800	102801	Mr. Elton	91	“ Mr. Elton and his bride ”
103019	103052	103013	103013	Harriet	107	“ it was very true — it was just as Miss Woodhouse described — it was not worth while to think about them — and she would not think about them any longer ”
103088	103180	103081	103081	Emma	79	“ Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton ’s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make me . You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.—Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you — and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . ”
103200	103373	103197	103197	Emma	79	“ I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important — and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due — or rather what would be kind by me . ”
103438	103480	103534	103534	herself	79	“ You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life — Want gratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for you!—Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! ”
103518	103529	103531	103531	she	79	“ There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , ”
103536	103692	103531	103531	she	79	“ There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved — which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not — but I know how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet!—I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a hundred such — And for a wife — a sensible man ’s wife — it is invaluable . I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! ”
103947	103955	103956	103956	She	79	“ elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . ”
104216	104222	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ”
104244	104268	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?—Is not she very charming ? ”
104279	104292	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ Oh ! yes — very — a very pleasing young woman . ”
104293	104302	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . ”
104303	104315	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . ”
104316	104331	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . ”
104332	104355	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ Oh ! no — there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . ”
104356	104361	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ I dare say , ”
104368	104380	104363	104363	Harriet	107	“ I dare say she was very much attached to him . ”
104381	104422	104224	104224	Harriet	107	“ Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ’s fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . ”
104423	104426	104428	104428	Harriet	107	“ Yes , ”
104431	104556	104428	104428	Harriet	107	“ and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again . He is just as superior as ever;—but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ‘ Augusta . ’ How delightful ! ”
104803	104809	104858	104858	she	195	“ My brother Mr. Suckling ’s seat;”—a
104864	104898	104839	104840	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the likeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ’s favourite room . ”—Mr
104903	104917	104900	104900	Elton	195	to.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . ”
104918	105079	105080	105080	Emma	79	“ And the staircase — You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) . A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . ”
105107	105220	105096	105097	Mrs. Elton	195	“ So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is not merely the house — the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way — just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . ”
105275	105302	105229	105229	She	79	“ When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties . ”
105303	105332	106180	106181	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that . It is the garden of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England . ”
105333	105365	105375	105376	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry . ”
105366	105373	105375	105376	Mrs. Elton	195	“ No , I fancy not , ”
105384	105395	105375	105376	Mrs. Elton	195	“ I never heard any county but Surry called so . ”
105400	105419	105421	105422	Mrs. Elton	195	“ My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , ”
105424	105617	105421	105422	Mrs. Elton	195	“ and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of our carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King’s - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ? ”
105618	105672	105375	105376	Mrs. Elton	195	“ No ; not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . ”
105673	105909	105421	105422	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ‘ I really can not get this girl to move from the house . I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . ’ Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father ’s state of health must be a great drawback . Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he should . Let me recommend Bath to you . I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . ”
105910	105959	105421	105422	Mrs. Elton	195	“ My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . ”
105960	106159	105421	105422	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Ah ! that ’s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse ’s spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to you , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . ”
106261	106291	106257	106258	Mrs. Elton	195	“ but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . ”
106307	106344	106257	106258	Mrs. Elton	195	“ I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady ’s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . ”
106345	106753	106257	106258	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea . A superior performer!—very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music — passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely can not do without music . It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too — knowing what I had been accustomed to — of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that the world I could give up — parties , balls , plays — for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to me . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ‘ But , ’ said I , ‘ to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . ’ ”
106754	106760	106762	106762	Emma	79	“ We can not suppose , ”
106766	106809	106762	106762	Emma	79	“ that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive . ”
106810	106947	106257	106258	Mrs. Elton	195	“ No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head . I am delighted to find myself in such a circle . I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ? If we exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies . Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know — there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music . ”
106948	106968	106257	106258	Mrs. Elton	195	“ But you , who are so extremely fond of it — there can be no danger , surely ? ”
106969	107099	106762	106762	Emma	79	“ I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music — never touches the instrument — though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys — Clara Partridge , that was — and of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate . Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . ”
107100	107108	107110	107110	Emma	79	“ But every thing of that kind , ”
107112	107122	107110	107110	Emma	79	“ will soon be in so regular a train — ”
107123	107126	107128	107129	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Well , ”
107133	107138	107128	107129	Mrs. Elton	195	“ we shall see . ”
107170	107178	107180	107180	she	195	“ We have been calling at Randalls , ”
107182	107259	107180	107180	she	195	“ and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . I like them extremely . Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature — quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you . And she appears so truly good — there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . She was your governess , I think ? ”
107282	107309	107270	107271	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman . ”
107310	107316	107318	107318	Emma	79	“ Mrs. Weston ’s manners , ”
107320	107345	107318	107318	Emma	79	“ were always particularly good . Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . ”
107346	107359	107360	107360	Emma	79	“ And who do you think came in while we were there ? ”
107381	107384	107386	107387	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Knightley ! ”
107389	107498	107386	107387	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Knightley himself!—Was not it lucky?—for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. ’s , I had a great curiosity . ‘ My friend Knightley ’ had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much . Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man . ”
107518	107522	107524	107524	her	79	“ Insufferable woman ! ”
107528	107751	107524	107524	her	79	“ Worse than I had supposed . Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley!—I could not have believed it . Knightley!—never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her caro sposo , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs. Weston!—Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse . I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ? How angry and how diverted he would be ! Ah ! there I am — thinking of him directly . Always the first person to be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind ! ”
107795	107801	107802	107802	he	415	“ Well , my dear , ”
107806	107993	107802	107802	he	415	“ considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you . She speaks a little too quick . A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor . However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . Though I think he had better not have married . I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I should in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before . Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . Ah ! it shews what a sad invalid I am ! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane . ”
107994	108010	107766	107766	her	2131	“ I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . Mr. Elton knows you . ”
108011	108040	107802	107802	he	415	“ Yes : but a young lady — a bride — I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . It was being very deficient . ”
108041	108094	107802	107802	he	415	“ But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride ? It ought to be no recommendation to you . It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them . ”
108095	108166	107766	107766	her	2131	“ No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady — and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected . More is avowedly due to her . A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . ”
108167	108209	107802	107802	he	415	“ Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is . And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies . ”
108210	108246	108247	108247	Emma	79	“ My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . ”
108545	108553	108543	108543	her	80	“ very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . ”
108873	109048	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.—A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike — and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth — but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward . Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ‘ Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ‘ And waste its fragrance on the desert air . ’ We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax . ”
109049	109061	109063	109063	Emma	254	“ I can not think there is any danger of it , ”
109066	109105	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	answer—“and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ’s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . ”
109106	109246	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Oh ! but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end ! And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me . I am a great advocate for timidity — and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . ”
109247	109290	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	“ You appear to feel a great deal — but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax ’s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than ”
109292	109657	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	“ My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . You and I need not be afraid . If we set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . We have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it . I have no idea of that sort of thing . It is not likely that I should , considering what I have been used to . My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be — for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.—However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.—I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties . ”
109658	109661	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought
109662	109736	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	Emma.—“You have not deserved this . You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax . ’ Heavens ! Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!—But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ’s tongue ! ”
109760	109765	108862	108863	Mrs. Elton	195	“ dear Miss Woodhouse . ”
109967	109977	110032	110032	Jane	142	“ She is a riddle , quite a riddle ! ”
109979	110031	110032	110032	Jane	142	she.—“To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton ’s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection . ”
110128	110145	110147	110147	Emma	79	“ She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , ”
110151	110211	110147	110147	Emma	79	“ She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.—She is not to be with the Dixons . The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle . ”
110244	110311	110236	110237	Mrs. Weston	84	“ We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma — but it is better than being always at home . Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . ”
110312	110320	110322	110323	Mr. Knightley	88	“ You are right , Mrs. Weston , ”
110326	110383	110322	110323	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . ”
110414	110448	110410	110410	she	79	“ Such attentions as Mrs. Elton ’s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton ’s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . ”
110449	110455	110457	110458	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I should not wonder , ”
110460	110529	110457	110458	Mrs. Weston	84	“ if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ’s eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton ’s civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . ”
110550	110735	110547	110547	he	2161	“ Another thing must be taken into consideration too — Mrs. Elton does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other — a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton ’s way before — and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . ”
110736	110747	110749	110749	Emma	79	“ I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , ”
110773	110776	110777	110777	he	118	“ Yes , ”
110780	110792	110777	110777	he	118	“ any body may know how highly I think of her . ”
110793	110797	110799	110799	Emma	79	“ And yet , ”
110828	110859	110826	110826	she	79	on—“And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . ”
110901	110924	110925	110925	He	88	“ Oh ! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand . Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . ”
110951	110993	110947	110947	he	88	“ That will never be , however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her — and I am very sure I shall never ask her . ”
111010	111026	111027	111027	He	88	“ You are not vain , Mr. Knightley . I will say that for you . ”
111052	111065	111034	111034	he	88	“ So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? ”
111066	111165	111166	111167	Mr. Knightley	88	“ No indeed I have not . You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . ”
111179	111215	111175	111175	his	88	“ No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . ”
111220	111259	111175	111175	his	88	“ Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman — but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . ”
111273	111276	111278	111278	she	79	“ Well , ”
111280	111291	111278	111278	she	79	“ and you soon silenced Mr. Cole , I suppose ? ”
111292	111334	111175	111175	his	88	“ Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . ”
111335	111561	111278	111278	she	79	“ In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles — what she calls them ! How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? She calls you , Knightley — what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax ’s mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton ’s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau . ”
111562	111568	111570	111571	Mr. Knightley—“I	263	“ Jane Fairfax has feeling , ”
111571	111672	111278	111278	she	79	Knightley—“I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong — and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - control ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be — And I love an open temper . No — till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always — but with no thought beyond . ”
111673	111679	111681	111681	Emma	79	“ Well , Mrs. Weston , ”
111688	111702	111681	111681	Emma	79	“ what do you say now to Mr. Knightley ’s marrying Jane Fairfax ? ”
111703	111753	111278	111278	she	79	“ Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me . ”
111817	111824	111826	111826	she	2166	“ I see how it is , ”
111828	111902	111826	111826	she	2166	“ I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . ”
112247	112297	112232	112232	Emma	79	“ She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . ”
112417	112423	112425	112425	she	79	“ This is very true , ”
112427	112491	112425	112425	she	79	“ at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant — and it is very shameful.—Of the same age — and always knowing her — I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never like me now . I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . ”
112954	112990	112951	112951	he	88	“ I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time . I hope you turned directly . ”
112991	113001	113003	113003	she	142	“ I went only to the post - office , ”
113005	113052	113003	113003	she	142	“ and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . A walk before breakfast does me good . ”
113053	113065	112951	112951	he	88	“ Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . ”
113066	113080	113003	113003	she	142	“ No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . ”
113089	113174	113081	113083	Mr. John Knightley	88	“ That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . ”
113186	113224	112951	112951	he	88	“ I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . ”
113225	113255	112951	112951	he	88	“ Indifferent ! Oh ! no — I never conceived you could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . ”
113256	113271	112951	112951	he	88	“ You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . ”
113272	113284	113286	113286	he	2195	“ I have often thought them the worst of the two , ”
113289	113305	113286	113286	he	2195	“ Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does . ”
113306	113435	112951	112951	he	88	“ Ah ! you are not serious now . I know Mr. John Knightley too well — I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . ”
113436	113453	113455	113456	John Knightley	88	“ When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , ”
113458	113538	113455	113456	John Knightley	88	“ I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other . Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle — but that is not the change I had in view for you . As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . ”
113553	113556	112951	112951	he	88	“ thank you ”
113637	113690	113631	113631	his	81	“ I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies are delicate plants . They should take care of their health and their complexion . My dear , did you change your stockings ? ”
113691	113713	113631	113631	his	81	“ Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . ”
113714	113800	113631	113631	his	81	“ My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . ”
113853	113901	113902	113902	Jane	142	“ My dear Jane , what is this I hear?—Going to the post - office in the rain!—This must not be , I assure you.—You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you . ”
113915	113966	113902	113902	Jane	142	“ Oh ! do not tell me . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.—To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority . ”
113967	113971	113973	113974	Mrs. Weston	84	“ My advice , ”
113979	114091	113973	113974	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I certainly do feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.—Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again . ”
114092	114104	114107	114108	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Oh ! she shall not do such a thing again , ”
114110	114121	114107	114108	Mrs. Elton	195	“ We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”—and
114123	114200	113902	113902	Jane	142	significantly—“there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from us I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . ”
114201	114207	114209	114209	Jane	142	“ You are extremely kind , ”
114211	114265	114209	114209	Jane	142	“ but I can not give up my early walk . I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . ”
114266	114358	113902	113902	Jane	142	“ My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . ”
114359	114363	114365	114365	Jane	142	“ Excuse me , ”
114368	114418	114365	114365	Jane	142	“ I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ’s . ”
114419	114442	114443	114443	Jane	142	“ Oh ! my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to employ our men . ”
114469	114479	114460	114460	she	142	“ The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! ”
114481	114512	114460	114460	she	142	she.—“The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! ”
114513	114521	114460	114460	she	142	“ It is certainly very well regulated . ”
114522	114593	114460	114460	she	142	“ So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong — and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder . ”
114594	114623	114625	114625	he	88	“ The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . If you want any farther explanation , ”
114629	114656	114625	114625	he	88	“ they are paid for it . That is the key to a great deal of capacity . The public pays and must be served well . ”
114672	114679	114681	114682	John Knightley	88	“ I have heard it asserted , ”
114684	114769	114681	114682	John Knightley	88	“ that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike . I have not always known their writing apart . ”
114770	114773	114775	114776	his brother	3468	“ Yes , ”
114779	114799	114775	114776	his brother	3468	“ there is a likeness . I know what you mean — but Emma ’s hand is the strongest . ”
114800	114808	114810	114811	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , ”
114813	114823	114810	114811	Mr. Woodhouse	81	“ and always did . And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with
114834	114841	114775	114776	his brother	3468	“ I never saw any gentleman ’s handwriting”—Emma
114874	114947	114869	114869	her	84	“ Now , how am I going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend — your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.—No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.—Now for it . ”
114955	114971	114953	114953	Emma	79	again—“Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ’s hands I ever saw . ”
114972	114979	114981	114982	Mr. Knightley	88	“ I do not admire it , ”
114984	115001	114981	114982	Mr. Knightley	88	“ It is too small — wants strength . It is like a woman ’s writing . ”
115019	115054	115011	115011	They	2206	“ No , it by no means wanted strength — it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong . Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce ? ”
115076	115085	115087	115087	Emma	79	“ If we were in the other room , ”
115089	115129	115087	115087	Emma	79	“ if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . I have a note of his.—Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? ”
115130	115138	115011	115011	They	2206	“ He chose to say he was employed ”
115140	115161	115011	115011	They	2206	“ Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . ”
115162	115176	115178	115179	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Oh ! when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , ”
115182	115203	115178	115179	Mr. Knightley	88	“ writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best . ”
115246	115262	115229	115229	his	81	“ Must I go first ? I really am ashamed of always leading the way . ”
115609	115615	115617	115617	she	142	“ Here is April come ! ”
115619	115633	115617	115617	she	142	“ I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here . ”
115634	115656	115572	115572	them	2209	“ But I have never fixed on June or any other month — merely looked forward to the summer in general . ”
115657	115666	115617	115617	she	142	“ But have you really heard of nothing ? ”
115667	115685	115617	115617	she	142	“ I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet . ”
115686	115713	115572	115572	them	2209	“ Oh ! my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . ”
115714	115719	115721	115721	Jane	142	“ I not aware ! ”
115727	115743	115721	115721	Jane	142	“ dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ? ”
115744	115856	115572	115572	them	2209	“ But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations . I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove . A cousin of Mr. Suckling , Mrs. Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . Wax - candles in the schoolroom ! You may imagine how desirable ! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge ’s is the one I would most wish to see you in . ”
115857	115871	115873	115873	Jane	142	“ Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , ”
115875	115918	115873	115873	Jane	142	“ I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself . But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . ”
115919	115990	115572	115572	them	2209	“ Trouble ! aye , I know your scruples . You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . ”
115991	116025	115572	115572	them	2209	“ Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . ”
116026	116108	115873	115873	Jane	142	“ But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ’s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . ”
116109	116194	115572	115572	them	2209	“ Excuse me , ma’am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something — Offices for the sale — not quite of human flesh — but of human intellect . ”
116195	116234	115572	115572	them	2209	“ Oh ! my dear , human flesh ! You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . ”
116235	116251	116253	116253	Jane	142	“ I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , ”
116255	116337	116253	116253	Jane	142	“ governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . ”
116338	116344	116346	116347	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Something that would do ! ”
116349	116412	116346	116347	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Aye , that may suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . ”
116413	116474	115572	115572	them	2209	“ You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman ’s family is all that I should condition for . ”
116475	116630	116346	116347	Mrs. Elton	195	“ I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;—that is — I do not know — if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;—yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;—and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest . ”
116631	116651	116653	116653	Jane	142	“ You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , ”
116655	116737	116653	116653	Jane	142	“ they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am . ”
116738	116750	116752	116753	Mrs. Elton	195	“ And I am quite serious too , I assure you , ”
116756	116782	116752	116753	Mrs. Elton	195	“ in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . ”
116827	117088	116816	116816	her	195	“ Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!—Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he is;—I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . Oh ! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it?—Selina ’s choice — handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed — quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ? ”
117376	117387	117370	117370	his	88	“ I could not have believed it even of him . ”
117539	117546	117548	117548	he	82	“ Read it , read it , ”
117550	117573	117548	117548	he	82	“ it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines — will not take you long ; read it to Emma . ”
117608	117826	117583	117583	he	82	“ Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it?—I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?—Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?—In town next week , you see — at the latest , I dare say ; for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . ”
118062	118078	118080	118081	Mr. Weston	82	“ I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , ”
118104	118117	118118	118118	he	82	“ You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , ”
118119	118135	118080	118081	Mr. Weston	82	continued—“and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . ”
118136	118179	118118	118118	he	82	“ Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . ”
118180	118273	118118	118118	he	82	“ You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure . — He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ’s hand , presumed to open it — though it was not directed to me — it was to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter . ”
118274	118344	118080	118081	Mr. Weston	82	“ And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston—(laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.—A most dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! ”
118345	118432	118080	118081	Mr. Weston	82	“ Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.—This letter tells us — it is a short letter — written in a hurry , merely to give us notice — it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill ’s account — she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her — so they are all to move southward without loss of time . ”
118433	118445	118118	118118	he	82	“ Indeed!—from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? ”
118446	118464	118080	118081	Mr. Weston	82	“ Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London , a considerable journey . ”
118465	118541	118080	118081	Mr. Weston	82	“ Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me — but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses . ”
118542	118551	118553	118554	Mr. Weston	82	“ The evil of the distance from Enscombe , ”
118556	118666	118553	118554	Mr. Weston	82	“ is , that Mrs. Churchill , as we understand , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank ’s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ’s ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness — but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . You must grant me that . ”
118667	118789	118080	118081	Mr. Weston	82	“ No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice — You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women — and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill ’s making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says it is quite horror to her — and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? ”
118790	118821	118823	118824	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for ”
118829	118859	118823	118824	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Oh ! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me . Selina is no fine lady , I assure you . Do not run away with such an idea . ”
118860	118887	118888	118889	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Is not she ? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . ”
118950	119037	118945	118946	Mr. Weston	82	“ Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect — but this is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but that indeed , by her own account , she has always been . I would not say so to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill ’s illness . ”
119038	119059	118933	118933	she	195	“ If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr. Weston?—To Bath , or to Clifton ? ”
119060	119127	118933	118933	she	195	“ She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her . The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . It is a retired place . A fine place , but very retired . ”
119128	119239	118945	118946	Mr. Weston	82	“ Aye — like Maple Grove , I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from every thing — in the most complete retirement.—And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . I always say a woman can not have too many resources — and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . ”
119240	119250	118933	118933	she	195	“ Frank was here in February for a fortnight . ”
119251	119304	118933	118933	she	195	“ So I remember to have heard . He will find an addition to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world . ”
119332	119368	119369	119369	He	82	“ My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston ’s letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton . ”
119381	119387	119389	119389	he	82	“ When Frank left us , ”
119391	119536	119389	119389	he	82	“ it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ’s news doubly welcome . It has been completely unexpected . That is , I always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up — but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ‘ How could he contrive to come ? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ’ and so forth — I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . I have observed , Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . ”
119537	119663	119664	119664	She	2246	“ Very true , Mr. Weston , perfectly true . It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be May before Hymen ’s saffron robe would be put on for us . Oh ! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! The carriage — we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair . ”
119685	119975	119675	119676	Mr. Weston	82	“ You were mentioning May . May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe — in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring — precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time . This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . I think it is so . I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . Mrs. Weston ’s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . She thinks nobody equal to him . ”
119976	120063	120064	120065	Mr. Weston	82	“ And I assure you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer . ”
120069	120073	120075	120075	he	82	“ I hope , ”
120078	120306	120075	120075	he	82	“ I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill . If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish . You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . She was the instigator . Frank ’s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ’s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart . ”
120307	120581	120582	120582	They	2247	“ Only think ! well , that must be infinitely provoking ! I have quite a horror of upstarts . Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves ! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly . People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families . A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr. Weston . One has not great hopes from Birmingham . I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr. Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . It is infinitely too bad . Mr. Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him — I believe , at least — I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death . ”
120714	120797	120709	120709	he	88	“ Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ’s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her ’s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . ”
120798	120807	120809	120809	Emma	79	“ I rather hope to satisfy you both , ”
120811	120841	120809	120809	Emma	79	“ for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . ”
120842	120857	120709	120709	he	88	“ And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again . ”
120858	120872	120709	120709	he	88	“ That is very likely . You think so , do not you ? ”
120873	120913	120809	120809	Emma	79	“ I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father — or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . ”
120914	120917	120709	120709	he	88	“ Increase ! ”
120918	120942	120709	120709	he	88	“ Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life . ”
120943	120952	120809	120809	Emma	79	“ Difference ! No indeed I am not . ”
120953	121066	120709	120709	he	88	“ There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!—When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr. Cole ’s , or balls at the Crown . The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great . ”
121067	121070	121072	121073	his brother	3468	“ Yes , ”
121076	121085	121072	121073	his brother	3468	“ it is Randalls that does it all . ”
121086	121142	120709	120709	he	88	“ Very well — and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way . And if they are , I only beg you to send them home . ”
121143	121146	121148	121149	Mr. Knightley	88	“ No , ”
121151	121173	121148	121149	Mr. Knightley	88	“ that need not be the consequence . Let them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be at leisure . ”
121174	121179	121181	121181	Emma	79	“ Upon my word , ”
121183	121397	121181	121181	Emma	79	“ you amuse me ! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing engagements of mine — what have they been ? Dining once with the Coles — and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I can not imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one — and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . ”
121957	122021	122022	122022	She	79	“ He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed — he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word — but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . ”
123113	123118	123119	123119	she	79	“ So unreasonably early ! ”
123470	123479	123481	123481	he	98	“ I think she must be here soon , ”
123483	123515	123481	123481	he	98	“ I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her . It can not be long , I think , before she comes . ”
123534	123565	123566	123566	Mr.	2295	“ I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her . I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton . I have no business to put myself forward . ”
123581	123589	123591	123592	Mr. Weston	82	“ But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! ”
123597	123606	123591	123592	Mr. Weston	82	“ We thought you were to bring them . ”
123686	123696	123698	123698	Frank	98	rain.—“I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , ”
123703	123711	123698	123698	Frank	98	“ Miss Bates must not be forgotten : ”
123765	123905	123742	123742	she	195	“ A very fine young man indeed , Mr. Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.—You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve — so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies — quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . ”
123957	124031	123950	123951	Mrs. Elton	195	“ I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a pleasure it is to send one ’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of them . ”
124137	124268	124133	124133	she	195	“ So very obliging of you!—No rain at all . Nothing to signify . I do not care for myself . Quite thick shoes . And Jane declares — Well!—(as soon as she was within the door ) Well ! This is brilliant indeed!—This is admirable!—Excellently contrived , upon my word . Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane , Jane , look!—did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ’s lamp . Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ‘ Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ’ said I — but I had not time for more . ”
124275	124879	124274	124275	Mrs. Weston.—“Very	284	Weston.—“Very well , I thank you , ma’am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache!—seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs. Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage!—excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment . Most comfortable carriage.—Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score . Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.—But two such offers in one day!—Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ‘ Upon my word , ma’am—. ’ Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr. Woodhouse ’s . I made her take her shawl — for the evenings are not warm — her large new shawl — Mrs. Dixon ’s wedding - present.—So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know — Mr. Dixon ’s choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely — and there was a mat to step upon — I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh ! Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother ’s spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?—Ah ! here ’s Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?—Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land!—Such a transformation!—Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)—that would be rude — but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look — how do you like Jane ’s hair?—You are a judge.—She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah ! Dr. Hughes I declare — and Mrs. Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.—How do you do ? How do you do?—Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it?—Where ’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh ! there he is . Do n’t disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the town — Mrs. Otway , I protest!—and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do you do ? How do you all do?—Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the worthy Coles.—Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me — never take coffee.—A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,—no hurry — Oh ! here it comes . Every thing so good ! ”
124968	124984	124954	124955	Mrs. Elton	195	“ How do you like my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my hair?”—with
125001	125105	124996	124997	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do — but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ’s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons — who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour — I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.—We shall see if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill . I like him very well . ”
125170	125206	125158	125158	Elton	195	“ Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?—I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . ”
125207	125208	125209	125210	Frank Churchill	98	“ Jane!”—repeated
125218	125233	125209	125210	Frank Churchill	98	displeasure.—“That is easy — but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . ”
125234	125242	125244	125244	Emma	79	“ How do you like Mrs. Elton ? ”
125249	125254	125244	125244	Emma	79	“ Not at all . ”
125255	125260	125305	125305	him	98	“ You are ungrateful . ”
125261	125267	125305	125305	him	98	“ Ungrateful!—What do you mean ? ”
125275	125300	125305	125305	him	98	smile—“No , do not tell me — I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is my father?—When are we to begin dancing ? ”
125393	125407	125409	125410	Mr. Weston	82	“ And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? ”
125412	125422	125409	125410	Mr. Weston	82	“ She will think Frank ought to ask her . ”
126294	126303	126286	126286	her	84	“ Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? ”
126311	126325	126286	126286	her	84	“ Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me . ”
126326	126346	126281	126283	gentle Mrs. Weston	84	“ Me!—oh ! no — I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer . ”
126347	126355	126357	126357	he	91	“ If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , ”
126359	126412	126357	126357	he	91	“ I shall have great pleasure , I am sure — for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert . ”
126413	126442	126281	126283	gentle Mrs. Weston	84	“ Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing — Miss Smith . ”
126443	126498	126499	126500	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging — and if I were not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command — but my dancing days are over . ”
126800	126817	126797	126797	her	79	“ Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good - natured , I declare . ”
126851	127491	126827	126828	Miss Bates	101	“ Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?—Here is your tippet . Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet . She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done — One door nailed up — Quantities of matting — My dear Jane , indeed you must . Mr. Churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! How well you put it on!—so gratified ! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.—I set off without saying a word , just as I told you . Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ‘ Oh ! ’ said I , ‘ I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr. William Cox . ’ My dear sir , you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not rather?—I am not helpless . Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other!—Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs. Elton is going ; dear Mrs. Elton , how elegant she looks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening!—Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one . Well , I was persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style — Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus — so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!—Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing!—Such elegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since — Well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where I sit is of no consequence . Oh ! do you recommend this side?—Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill — only it seems too good — but just as you please . What you direct in this house can not be wrong . Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? Soup too ! Bless me ! I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I can not help beginning . ”
127560	127569	127571	127571	he	88	“ They aimed at wounding more than Harriet , ”
127573	127585	127586	127586	He	88	“ Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? ”
127601	127642	127586	127586	He	88	“ She ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.—To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet . ”
127643	127647	127649	127649	Emma	79	“ I did , ”
127651	127659	127660	127660	He	88	“ and they can not forgive me . ”
127680	127695	127676	127676	he	88	“ I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections . ”
127696	127714	127586	127586	He	88	“ Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ? ”
127715	127740	127586	127586	He	88	“ Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . ”
127741	127793	127586	127586	He	88	“ I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It was through a series of strange blunders ! ”
127794	127881	127882	127882	Emma	79	“ And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without . An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl — infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton . I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . ”
127903	127937	127892	127893	Mr. Weston	82	“ Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?—Come Emma , set your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep ! ”
127938	127943	127945	127945	Emma	79	“ I am ready , ”
127947	127953	127945	127945	Emma	79	“ whenever I am wanted . ”
127954	127963	127965	127966	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Whom are you going to dance with ? ”
127977	127987	127968	127968	She	79	“ With you , if you will ask me . ”
127988	127992	127994	127994	he	88	“ Will you ? ”
128000	128033	127994	127994	he	88	“ Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . ”
128034	128043	127968	127968	She	79	“ Brother and sister ! no , indeed . ”
129995	130034	129971	129971	Harriet	107	“ Miss Woodhouse — if you are at leisure — I have something that I should like to tell you — a sort of confession to make — and then , you know , it will be over . ”
130073	130088	130089	130089	she	107	“ It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , ”
130092	130162	130089	130089	she	107	“ to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in one respect , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary — I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . ”
130163	130166	130168	130168	Emma	79	“ Yes , ”
130170	130176	130168	130168	Emma	79	“ I hope I do . ”
130177	130190	130192	130192	Harriet	107	“ How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! ... ”
130196	130420	130422	130422	she	2418	“ It seems like madness ! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not — except that of the two I had rather not see him — and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him — but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable — I shall never forget her look the other night!—However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil.—No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ’s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy — what I ought to have destroyed long ago — what I ought never to have kept — I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke).—However , now I will destroy it all — and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Can not you guess what this parcel holds ? ”
130429	130443	130422	130422	she	2418	“ Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing ? ”
130444	130465	130466	130466	She	2418	“ No — I can not call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much . ”
130547	130550	130552	130552	Harriet	107	“ Now , ”
130554	130559	130552	130552	Harriet	107	“ you must recollect . ”
130560	130568	130518	130518	Harriet	107	“ No , indeed I do not . ”
130569	130755	130552	130552	Harriet	107	“ Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat — just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came — I think the very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?—But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it — so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . ”
130756	130761	130763	130763	Emma	79	“ My dearest Harriet ! ”
130776	130876	130763	130763	Emma	79	“ you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic — I knew nothing of that till this moment — but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!—Oh ! my sins , my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on — what else ? ”
130877	130901	130763	130763	Emma	79	“ And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . ”
130902	130919	130921	130921	Emma	79	“ And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! ”
130944	130981	130939	130939	she	79	“ Lord bless me ! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this . ”
130982	130985	130987	130987	Harriet	107	“ Here , ”
130995	131030	130987	130987	Harriet	107	“ here is something still more valuable , I mean that has been more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . ”
131054	131060	130939	130939	she	79	“ This was really his , ”
131062	131213	130939	130939	she	79	Harriet.—“Do not you remember one morning?—no , I dare say you do not . But one morning — I forget exactly the day — but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before that evening , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . ”
131214	131220	131222	131222	Emma	79	“ I do remember it , ”
131224	131285	131222	131222	Emma	79	“ I perfectly remember it.—Talking about spruce - beer.—Oh ! yes — Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton ’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it.—Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ? I have an idea he was standing just here . ”
131286	131323	130939	130939	she	79	“ Ah ! I do not know . I can not recollect.—It is very odd , but I can not recollect.—Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now . ”
131325	131331	131222	131222	Emma	79	“ Well , go on . ”
131332	131375	130939	130939	she	79	“ Oh ! that ’s all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say — except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . ”
131376	131394	130939	130939	she	79	“ My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? ”
131395	131458	131222	131222	Emma	79	“ Yes , simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was — but had not resolution enough to part with them . ”
131459	131495	130939	130939	she	79	“ But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?—I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful . ”
131496	131505	131507	131507	Harriet	107	“ I shall be happier to burn it , ”
131509	131541	131507	131507	Harriet	107	“ It has a disagreeable look to me . I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . ”
131542	131546	131548	131548	Emma	79	“ And when , ”
131550	131560	131548	131548	Emma	79	“ will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? ”
131646	131662	131634	131634	She	79	“ Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so”—and
131685	131691	131677	131677	Harriet	107	“ I shall never marry . ”
131723	131731	131677	131677	Harriet	107	“ Never marry!—This is a new resolution . ”
131732	131744	131797	131797	She	79	“ It is one that I shall never change , however . ”
131750	131770	131797	131797	She	79	“ I hope it does not proceed from — I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? ”
131771	131776	131778	131778	Harriet	107	“ Mr. Elton indeed ! ”
131779	131781	131778	131778	Harriet	107	indignantly.—“Oh ! no”—and
131789	131796	131778	131778	Harriet	107	“ so superior to Mr. Elton ! ”
131954	132010	132425	132425	Harriet	107	“ Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ? ”
132011	132079	132425	132425	Harriet	107	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose — Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance — and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially . ”
132080	132104	132425	132425	Harriet	107	“ I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet . The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . ”
132105	132163	132425	132425	Harriet	107	“ Service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time — when I saw him coming — his noble look — and my wretchedness before . Such a change ! In one moment such a change ! From perfect misery to perfect happiness ! ”
132164	132424	132425	132425	Harriet	107	“ It is very natural . It is natural , and it is honourable.—Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise . I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet . I do not by any means engage for its being returned . Consider what you are about . Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him . Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject . I am determined against all interference . Henceforward I know nothing of the matter . Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . But take care of yourself . I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to him , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value . ”
132889	132896	132884	132884	his	88	“ Myself creating what I saw , ”
133111	133116	133118	133119	Frank Churchill	98	“ By the bye , ”
133125	133139	133121	133122	Mrs. Weston	84	“ what became of Mr. Perry ’s plan of setting up his carriage ? ”
133148	133161	133140	133141	Mrs. Weston	84	“ I did not know that he ever had any such plan . ”
133162	133181	133121	133122	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago . ”
133182	133187	133121	133122	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Me ! impossible ! ”
133188	133253	133140	133141	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to her persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . You must remember it now ? ”
133254	133267	133121	133122	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . ”
133268	133314	133121	133122	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Never ! really , never!—Bless me ! how could it be?—Then I must have dreamt it — but I was completely persuaded — Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . ”
133315	133322	133324	133325	Mr. Weston	82	“ What is this?—What is this ? ”
133327	133362	133324	133325	Mr. Weston	82	“ about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I am glad he can afford it . You had it from himself , had you ? ”
133363	133368	133370	133371	his son	3218	“ No , sir , ”
133375	133472	133370	133371	his son	3218	“ I seem to have had it from nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston ’s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars — but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . I am a great dreamer . I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away — and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry . ”
133473	133479	133481	133482	his father	3213	“ It is odd though , ”
133484	133607	133481	133482	his father	3213	“ that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe . Perry ’s setting up his carriage ! and his wife ’s persuading him to it , out of care for his health — just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature . What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream ! And at others , what a heap of absurdities it is ! Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ? ”
133640	133648	133650	133651	Miss Bates	101	“ Why , to own the truth , ”
133667	134018	133650	133651	Miss Bates	101	“ if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have — I do not mean to say that he did not dream it — I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world — but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves — but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n’t you remember grandmama ’s telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to — very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother — indeed I do not know who is not — and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she?—Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry ’s coming.—Extraordinary dream , indeed ! ”
134233	134237	134239	134240	Frank Churchill	98	“ Miss Woodhouse , ”
134257	134319	134239	134240	Frank Churchill	98	“ have your nephews taken away their alphabets — their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ? This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again . ”
134423	134428	134436	134436	he	98	“ poor little boys , ”
134796	134802	134793	134793	she	79	“ Nonsense ! for shame ! ”
134816	134825	134805	134806	Frank Churchill	98	“ I will give it to her — shall I?”—and
134837	134852	134829	134829	Emma	79	“ No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . ”
134997	135008	134987	134987	he	88	“ I did not know that proper names were allowed , ”
135052	135061	135063	135064	the latter	1955	“ Aye , very true , my dear , ”
135072	135123	135063	135064	the latter	1955	word—“I was just going to say the same thing . It is time for us to be going indeed . The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . My dear sir , you are too obliging . We really must wish you good night . ”
135307	135312	135314	135314	he	88	“ Pray , Emma , ”
135316	135370	135314	135314	he	88	“ may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . ”
135407	135410	135411	135411	she	79	“ Oh ! ”
135417	135429	135411	135411	she	79	“ it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . ”
135430	135434	135435	135435	he	88	“ The joke , ”
135439	135448	135435	135435	he	88	“ seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . ”
135555	135560	135562	135562	he	88	“ My dear Emma , ”
135570	135592	135562	135562	he	88	“ do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? ”
135593	135615	135879	135879	She	2467	“ Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh ! yes , perfectly.—Why do you make a doubt of it ? ”
135616	135638	135879	135879	She	2467	“ Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? ”
135639	135644	135645	135645	she	79	“ Never , never ! ”
135651	135679	135879	135879	She	2467	eagerness—“Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me . And how could it possibly come into your head ? ”
135680	135708	135879	135879	She	2467	“ I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them — certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public . ”
135709	135878	135879	135879	She	2467	“ Oh ! you amuse me excessively . I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander — but it will not do — very sorry to check you in your first essay — but indeed it will not do . There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances — feelings rather of a totally different nature — it is impossible exactly to explain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it — but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be . That is , I presume it to be so on her side , and I can answer for its being so on his . I will answer for the gentleman ’s indifference . ”
136572	136584	136586	136586	he	82	“ I am glad you approve of what I have done , ”
136590	136641	136586	136586	he	82	“ But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party . A large party secures its own amusement . And she is a good - natured woman after all . One could not leave her out . ”
136754	136763	136764	136764	she	195	“ Is not this most vexatious , Knightley ? ”
136765	136816	136743	136744	Mrs. Elton	195	cried.—“And such weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious . What are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston . ”
136817	136825	136827	136828	Mr. Knightley	88	“ You had better explore to Donwell , ”
136830	136850	136827	136828	Mr. Knightley	88	“ That may be done without horses . Come , and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast . ”

136977	136984	136986	136986	she	195	“ You may depend upon me , ”
136988	137012	136986	136986	she	195	“ I certainly will come . Name your day , and I will come . You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? ”
137013	137021	137023	137023	he	88	“ I can not name a day , ”
137025	137041	136986	136986	she	195	“ till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you . ”
137042	137077	136986	136986	she	195	“ Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give me a carte - blanche.—I am Lady Patroness , you know . It is my party . I will bring friends with me . ”
137078	137086	137088	137088	he	88	“ I hope you will bring Elton , ”
137090	137103	137088	137088	he	88	“ but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations . ”
137104	137165	136986	136986	she	195	“ Oh ! now you are looking very sly . But consider — you need not be afraid of delegating power to me . I am no young lady on her preferment . Married women , you know , may be safely authorised . It is my party . Leave it all to me . I will invite your guests . ”
137166	137167	136986	136986	she	195	“ No,”—he
137169	137197	136986	136986	she	195	replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is — ”
137198	137206	137208	137209	Mrs. Elton	195	“ — Mrs. Weston , I suppose , ”
137214	137232	137208	137209	Mrs. Elton	195	“ No — Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . ”
137233	137242	137243	137243	she	195	“ Ah ! you are an odd creature ! ”
137253	137312	137208	137209	Mrs. Elton	195	herself.—“You are a humourist , and may say what you like . Quite a humourist . Well , I shall bring Jane with me — Jane and her aunt.—The rest I leave to you . I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family . Do n’t scruple . I know you are attached to them . ”
137313	137336	136986	136986	she	195	“ You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . ”
137337	137487	136986	136986	she	195	“ That ’s quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:—but as you like . It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade — a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;—and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors — a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ? ”
137488	137559	137208	137209	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors . When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . ”
137560	137616	136986	136986	she	195	“ Well — as you please ; only do n’t have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything — ”
137617	137631	136986	136986	she	195	“ I have not the least wish for it , I thank you . ”
137632	137648	137208	137209	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Well — but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . ”
137649	137672	136986	136986	she	195	“ I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ’s assistance . ”
137673	137777	136986	136986	she	195	“ I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me — and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;—and very long walks , you know — in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . ”
137778	137837	137208	137209	Mrs. Elton	195	“ You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs. Cole ’s . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . ”
137838	137918	136986	136986	she	195	“ That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend . Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.—Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . ”
138034	138171	138024	138024	He	81	“ Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma ’s , and Harriet ’s going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them — very kind and sensible — much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining out . ”
138830	138990	139032	139032	she	84	of.—“The best fruit in England — every body ’s favourite — always wholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather for one ’s self — the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly the best time — never tired — every sort good — hautboy infinitely superior — no comparison — the others hardly eatable — hautboys very scarce — Chili preferred — white wood finest flavour of all — price of strawberries in London — abundance about Bristol — Maple Grove — cultivation — beds when to be renewed — gardeners thinking exactly different — no general rule — gardeners never to be put out of their way — delicious fruit — only too rich to be eaten much of — inferior to cherries — currants more refreshing — only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping — glaring sun — tired to death — could bear it no longer — must go and sit in the shade . ”
139275	139299	139255	139255	she	312	removal.—“Should not they walk ? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens — all the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent . ”—The
139744	139769	139773	139773	him	88	“ These are my own concerns . I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin . ”—She
139897	139917	139883	139883	He	3213	“ His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them . ”—Mrs
140331	140338	140340	140340	she	142	“ Will you be so kind , ”
140342	140453	140340	140340	she	142	“ when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent — but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any body . It would only be giving trouble and distress . Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ? ”
140454	140471	140564	140564	She	2553	“ Certainly , if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ? ”
140472	140491	140340	140340	she	142	“ Yes — what should hurt me?—I walk fast . I shall be at home in twenty minutes . ”
140492	140530	140340	140340	she	142	“ But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . Let my father ’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage . It can be round in five minutes . ”
140531	140563	140564	140564	She	2553	“ Thank you , thank you — but on no account.—I would rather walk.—And for me to be afraid of walking alone!—I , who may so soon have to guard others ! ”
140576	140606	140571	140571	Emma	79	“ That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . I must order the carriage . The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already . ”
140607	140609	140340	140340	she	142	“ I am,”—she
140610	140682	140683	140683	Emma	79	answered—“I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue — quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . ”
140732	140743	140728	140728	her	79	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!”—seemed
140775	140786	140788	140788	Emma	79	“ Such a home , indeed ! such an aunt ! ”
140799	140823	140824	140824	Jane	142	“ I do pity you . And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . ”
141046	141058	141060	141060	Emma	79	“ You will soon be cooler , if you sit still , ”
141062	141121	141060	141060	Emma	79	“ As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared — but such a point had been made of my coming ! You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . I met one as I came — Madness in such weather!—absolute madness ! ”
141211	141231	141204	141204	she	79	“ No — he should not eat . He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter . ”
141269	141308	141256	141256	Emma	79	“ I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet ’s sweet easy temper will not mind it . ”
141408	141422	141424	141424	he	98	“ As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad , ”
141426	141474	141424	141424	he	98	“ I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places . You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at — or my tour to read — or my poem . I shall do something to expose myself . ”
141475	141506	141386	141386	them	2565	“ That may be — but not by sketches in Swisserland . You will never go to Swisserland . Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England . ”
141507	141609	141386	141386	them	2565	“ They may be induced to go too . A warm climate may be prescribed for her . I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . I assure you I have . I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . I ought to travel . I am tired of doing nothing . I want a change . I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy — I am sick of England — and would leave it to - morrow , if I could . ”
141610	141635	141424	141424	he	98	“ You are sick of prosperity and indulgence . Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? ”
141636	141680	141386	141386	them	2565	“ I sick of prosperity and indulgence ! You are quite mistaken . I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . I am thwarted in every thing material . I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . ”
141681	141739	141386	141386	them	2565	“ You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us . ”
141740	141760	141386	141386	them	2565	“ No — I shall not stir . I shall sit by you . You are my best cure . ”
141761	141806	141424	141424	he	98	“ We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;—you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ? ”
141807	141824	141386	141386	them	2565	“ No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening . ”
141825	141840	141386	141386	them	2565	“ But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning . ”
141841	141860	141424	141424	he	98	“ No — It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross . ”
141861	141868	141386	141386	them	2565	“ Then pray stay at Richmond . ”
141869	141894	141386	141386	them	2565	“ But if I do , I shall be crosser still . I can never bear to think of you all there without me . ”
141895	141920	141424	141424	he	98	“ These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . I shall press you no more . ”
142022	142037	142015	142015	his	98	“ Well;—if you wish me to stay and join the party , I will . ”
142553	142564	142565	142565	They	2567	“ Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively . ”
142670	142679	142681	142681	he	98	“ How much I am obliged to you , ”
142683	142720	142681	142681	he	98	“ for telling me to come to - day!—If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . I had quite determined to go away again . ”
142721	142771	142662	142662	She	79	“ Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . I was a kinder friend than you deserved . But you were humble . You begged hard to be commanded to come . ”
142772	142789	142681	142681	he	98	“ Do n’t say I was cross . I was fatigued . The heat overcame me . ”
142790	142798	142681	142681	he	98	“ It is hotter to - day . ”
142799	142813	142662	142662	She	79	“ Not to my feelings . I am perfectly comfortable to - day . ”
142814	142824	142681	142681	he	98	“ You are comfortable because you are under command . ”
142825	142829	142681	142681	he	98	“ Your command?—Yes . ”
142830	142900	142662	142662	She	79	“ Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command . You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again — and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . ”
142901	142944	142681	142681	he	98	“ It comes to the same thing . I can have no self - command without a motive . You order me , whether you speak or not . And you can be always with me . You are always with me . ”
142945	142973	142681	142681	he	98	“ Dating from three o’clock yesterday . My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before . ”
142974	142994	142662	142662	She	79	“ Three o’clock yesterday ! That is your date . I thought I had seen you first in February . ”
142995	143029	142681	142681	he	98	“ Your gallantry is really unanswerable . But ( lowering her voice)—nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . ”
143030	143040	143042	143042	he	2585	“ I say nothing of which I am ashamed , ”
143048	143091	143042	143042	he	2585	“ I saw you first in February . Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can . Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side , and Dorking on the other . I saw you first in February . ”
143094	143151	143152	143152	Some	316	whispering—“Our companions are excessively stupid . What shall we do to rouse them ? Any nonsense will serve . They shall talk . Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ? ”
143189	143207	143180	143181	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ? ”
143208	143213	143214	143214	Emma	79	“ Oh ! no , no”—cried
143221	143291	143180	143181	Mr. Knightley	88	could—“Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now . Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . ”
143292	143300	143302	143303	Mrs. Elton	195	“ It is a sort of thing , ”
143306	143346	143302	143303	Mrs. Elton	195	“ which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the Chaperon of the party — I never was in any circle — exploring parties — young ladies — married women — ”
143362	143405	143356	143356	he	431	“ Very true , my love , very true . Exactly so , indeed — quite unheard of — but some ladies say any thing . Better pass it off as a joke . Every body knows what is due to you . ”
143406	143412	143414	143414	Frank	98	“ It will not do , ”
143418	143550	143414	143414	Frank	98	“ they are most of them affronted . I will attack them with more address . Ladies and gentlemen — I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated — or two things moderately clever — or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . ”
143551	143557	143559	143560	Miss Bates	101	“ Oh ! very well , ”
143562	143632	143559	143560	Miss Bates	101	“ then I need not be uneasy . ‘ Three things very dull indeed . ’ That will just do for me , you know . I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , sha n’t I ? ( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body ’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall ? ”
143638	143667	143668	143669	Miss Bates	101	“ Ah ! ma’am , but there may be a difficulty . Pardon me — but you will be limited as to number — only three at once . ”
143711	143763	143704	143704	shewed	2587	“ Ah!—well — to be sure . Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue . I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend . ”
143764	143770	143772	143773	Mr. Weston	82	“ I like your plan , ”
143775	143798	143772	143773	Mr. Weston	82	“ Agreed , agreed . I will do my best . I am making a conundrum . How will a conundrum reckon ? ”
143799	143811	143813	143813	his	82	“ Low , I am afraid , sir , very low , ”
143814	143829	143772	143773	Mr. Weston	82	son;—“but we shall be indulgent — especially to any one who leads the way . ”
143830	143835	143837	143837	Emma	79	“ No , no , ”
143839	143870	143837	143837	Emma	79	“ it will not reckon low . A conundrum of Mr. Weston ’s shall clear him and his next neighbour . Come , sir , pray let me hear it . ”
143871	143880	143882	143883	Mr. Weston	82	“ I doubt its being very clever myself , ”
143885	143911	143882	143883	Mr. Weston	82	“ It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ? ”
143912	143926	143837	143837	Emma	79	“ What two letters!—express perfection ! I am sure I do not know . ”
143927	143959	143882	143883	Mr. Weston	82	“ Ah ! you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em - ma.—Do you understand ? ”
144021	144062	144016	144017	Mr. Knightley	88	“ This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . Perfection should not have come quite so soon . ”
144063	144076	144078	144079	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Oh ! for myself , I protest I must be excused , ”
144081	144275	144078	144079	Mrs. Elton	195	“ I really can not attempt — I am not at all fond of the sort of thing . I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with . I knew who it came from . An abominable puppy!—You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) . These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . Miss Woodhouse must excuse me . I am not one of those who have witty things at every body ’s service . I do not pretend to be a wit . I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . Pass us , if you please , Mr. Churchill . Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself . We have nothing clever to say — not one of us . “
144284	144296	144297	144297	I	0	” added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; “
144330	144331	144328	144328	Augusta	192	” “
144358	144373	144351	144351	Jane	101	” Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . “
144377	144389	144374	144375	Happy couple	2593	” said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing:—“How
144530	144549	144573	144573	You	2603	” Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . “
144557	144572	144573	144573	You	2603	”—She was stopped by a cough . Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . “
144577	144588	144573	144573	You	2603	” said he , gravely . She recovered her voice . “
144685	144709	144739	144739	you	2603	” He made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , “
144802	144803	144790	144790	I	0	” “
144810	144811	144808	144808	myself	0	” “
144820	144821	144808	144808	myself	0	” “
144837	144838	144830	144830	You	2603	” “
144882	144951	144871	144871	I	0	” Emma was in no danger of forgetting . It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . Would not Harriet be the very creature described ? Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it . “
144956	144963	144954	144954	ma’am	4289	” said Jane to her aunt , “
144970	144971	144967	144968	Mrs. Elton	195	” “
145044	145253	145041	145041	I	0	” They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley . Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man ’s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again . While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr. Knightley by her side . He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , “
145337	145353	145330	145330	I	0	” Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . “
145385	145386	145379	145379	she	2619	” “
145464	145465	145430	145430	her	2619	” “
145468	145472	145430	145430	her	2619	” cried Emma , “
145505	145506	145507	145507	They	2622	” “
145511	145515	145516	145516	I	0	” said he , “
145773	146327	146330	146330	you	2628	” While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in . He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless . They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern . She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome — then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late . He had turned away , and the horses were in motion . She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind . She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed — almost beyond what she could conceal . Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life . She was most forcibly struck . The truth of this representation there was no denying . She felt it at her heart . How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates ! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not compose her . As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more . She never had been so depressed . Happily it was not necessary to speak . There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were . CHAPTER VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma ’s thoughts all the evening . How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell . They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . A whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it . There , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart . She hoped no one could have said to her , “
146348	146540	146339	146339	I	0	” Miss Bates should never again — no , never ! If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . But it should be so no more . In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse . She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . She had no objection . She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not . “
146548	146690	146339	146339	I	0	” She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule . There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking . She heard Miss Bates ’s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , “
146716	146741	146708	146708	I	0	” Poor old Mrs. Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . “
146751	146755	146745	146745	Jane	101	” said she , “
146825	146850	146819	146819	she	177	” Emma seriously hoped she would . She had a moment ’s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her . But Miss Bates soon came—“Very
146853	146904	146907	146908	Miss Woodhouse	90	obliged”—but Emma ’s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before — less ease of look and manner . A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings . The touch seemed immediate . “
147446	147575	147434	147434	I	0	” Emma was most sincerely interested . Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude — sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax ’s advantage and comfort as possible . “
147600	147601	147586	147586	She	2653	” “
147606	147611	147586	147586	She	2653	” replied Miss Bates . “
147618	147625	147613	147613	you	2654	” There was no bearing such an “
147628	147644	147613	147613	you	2654	” and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of — “
147654	147655	147658	147659	Mrs. Smallridge	322	” “
147739	147740	147741	147742	Mrs. Elton	195	” “
147757	147758	147741	147742	Mrs. Elton	195	” “
148038	148039	148040	148040	You	0	” “
148048	148049	148045	148046	Mrs. Elton	195	” “
148102	148103	148104	148105	Mr. Knightley	88	” “
148113	148114	148111	148111	he	88	” “
148251	148252	148253	148254	Miss Fairfax	142	” “
148277	148278	148282	148282	she	142	” “
148285	148286	148282	148282	she	142	” “
148330	148331	148317	148317	I	0	” “
148485	148486	148489	148489	madam	1401	” “
148491	148495	148489	148489	madam	1401	” cried Emma , “
148536	148537	148538	148538	You	142	” “
148546	148547	148538	148538	You	142	” “
148557	148558	148551	148552	Miss Fairfax	142	” “
148626	148627	148600	148600	I	0	” “
148658	148659	148667	148667	they	817	” “
148989	149300	148983	148983	Jane	142	” Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill ’s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence . What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler ’s own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill — which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady . There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma ’s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind . The contrast between Mrs. Churchill ’s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ’s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing — and she sat musing on the difference of woman ’s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ’s saying , “
149416	149546	149403	149403	she	101	” Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave . CHAPTER IX Emma ’s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her . Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father.—Mr . Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , “
149607	149608	149589	149589	you	2696	” “
149621	149622	149627	149627	I	0	” “
149637	149690	149627	149627	I	0	” Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going — her father began his inquiries . “
149756	150309	149748	149748	She	79	” Emma ’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr. Knightley.—It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from hers , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured . — He looked at her with a glow of regard . She was warmly gratified — and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.—He took her hand;—whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say — she might , perhaps , have rather offered it — but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips — when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.—Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive.—He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped.—The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . It spoke such perfect amity.—He left them immediately afterwards — gone in a moment . He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance . Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed — but it might have happened at a better time — and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.—They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found . It was a pity that she had not come back earlier ! In the hope of diverting her father ’s thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley ’s going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check,—interested , without disturbing him . He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ’s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr. Knightley ’s going to London had been an unexpected blow . “
150444	150684	150685	150687	Poor Mrs. Churchill	94	” The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background . An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill ! Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return . A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle . The great Mrs. Churchill was no more . It was felt as such things must be felt . Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried . Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame . Mrs. Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances . In one point she was fully justified . She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . “
150755	150769	150747	150748	Mr. Churchill	98	”—Even Mr. Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , “
150781	151296	150747	150748	Mr. Churchill	98	” and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma . The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband — her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion — and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill ’s death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ’s side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ’s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness — and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . “
151306	151672	151297	151298	Miss Fairfax	142	” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge ’s at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged — appetite quite gone — and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it otherwise — and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her — be it only an hour or two — from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name — mentioning that she had Mr. Perry ’s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note : “
151688	151882	151297	151298	Miss Fairfax	142	” Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates ’s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her — but it would not do;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service — and every thing that message could do was tried — but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.—Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . “
151944	152111	152137	152137	she	101	” Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself — she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ’s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:—Mr . Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note . In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but “
152155	152379	152137	152137	she	101	” When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt — putting every thing together — that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her . She was sorry , very sorry . Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove . CHAPTER X One morning , about ten days after Mrs. Churchill ’s decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who “
152394	152431	152137	152137	she	101	”—He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , “
152460	152461	152455	152455	She	84	” “
152466	152467	152463	152463	she	84	” “
152510	152511	152507	152507	you	2712	” “
152545	152546	152540	152540	she	84	” “
152575	152650	152557	152557	You	2712	” To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma . Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls . “
152651	152661	152662	152663	Mr. Weston	82	Now,”—said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now
152673	152674	152662	152663	Mr. Weston	82	” “
152677	152679	152681	152681	me	0	no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t
152720	152721	152710	152710	Emma	79	” “
152727	152734	152710	152710	Emma	79	” cried Emma , standing still with terror.—“Good
152768	152769	152759	152759	you	82	” “
152777	152779	152780	152781	Mr. Weston	82	” — “
152817	152818	152820	152820	my	0	” “
152825	152827	152828	152828	Your	0	” — “
152870	152871	152873	152873	my	0	” “
152876	152882	152873	152873	my	0	” said he very seriously , “
152905	152916	152917	152917	I	0	” Emma ’s courage returned , and she walked on . “
152921	152925	152917	152917	I	0	” he continued , “
153006	153118	153121	153124	that gentleman on horseback	2723	” Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort . She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern — something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,—something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward . Her fancy was very active . Half a dozen natural children , perhaps — and poor Frank cut off!—This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . It inspired little more than an animating curiosity . “
153126	153151	153121	153124	that gentleman on horseback	2723	” said she , as they proceeded — speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view . “

153195	153196	153174	153174	He	98	” “
153211	153232	153235	153235	Frank	98	” For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , “
153249	153258	153235	153235	Frank	98	” They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well
153263	153271	153274	153274	her	1340	” said he , as they entered the room—“I
153311	153327	153333	153333	my	0	”—And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room,—“I
153343	153377	153336	153336	She	1340	” Mrs. Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ’s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , “
153444	153445	153447	153447	you	3120	” “
153452	153461	153447	153447	you	3120	” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice . “
153483	153484	153464	153464	you	3120	” “
153500	153501	153492	153494	Mr. Frank Churchill	98	” “
153519	153533	153513	153513	I	0	” ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up . ) “
153570	153587	153556	153556	He	98	” She stopped to breathe . Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet . “
153595	153600	153608	153608	you	3120	” resumed Mrs. Weston ; “
153639	153652	153633	153633	they	2735	” Emma even jumped with surprize;—and , horror - struck , exclaimed , “
153668	153669	153662	153662	You	79	” “
153676	153700	153701	153701	You	3120	” returned Mrs. Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover — “
153785	153827	153783	153783	him	2737	” Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between two ideas — her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation . “
153830	153841	153783	153783	him	2737	” said she at last , trying to recover herself ; “
153880	153881	153898	153898	his	2737	” “
153912	153922	153905	153905	his	2737	” Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , “
153962	153983	153985	153985	you	79	” Mrs. Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma ’s countenance was as steady as her words . “
154001	154005	154006	154006	I	0	” she continued , “
154102	154140	154093	154094	Mrs. Weston	84	” Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do . “
154152	154156	154141	154142	Mr. Weston	82	” said she . “
154199	154200	154191	154191	we	2741	” “
154331	154332	154336	154336	he	82	” “
154347	154348	154336	154336	he	82	” “
154397	154398	154407	154407	he	82	” “
154491	154492	154459	154459	he	82	” “
154568	154569	154579	154579	his	82	” “
154613	154614	154615	154616	Good God	2755	” “
154618	154625	154615	154616	Good God	2755	” cried Emma , not attending to her.—“Mrs
154668	154669	154670	154670	He	82	” “
154807	154814	154820	154820	him	82	” Emma began to listen better . “
154823	154828	154829	154829	He	82	” continued Mrs. Weston . “
154973	154974	154975	154975	His	82	” “
154978	154983	154975	154975	His	82	” replied Emma dryly , “
155004	155005	154999	155000	Mr. Churchill	98	” “
155103	155104	155096	155096	his	82	” “
155107	155111	155112	155112	he	82	” thought Emma , “
155121	155122	155112	155112	he	82	” “
155274	155275	155266	155266	his	98	” “
155306	155320	155298	155300	none of them	2771	” Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush . “
155345	155346	155326	155326	He	98	” “
155349	155353	155326	155326	He	98	” said Emma , “
155496	155497	155498	155498	I	0	” “
155506	155511	155498	155498	I	0	” replied Mrs. Weston . “
155535	155536	155537	155537	You	0	” “
155563	155564	155550	155550	you	0	” “
155610	155651	155604	155604	I	0	” At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , “
155810	155811	155841	155842	Jane Fairfax’s.—Of	336	” “
155816	155821	155841	155842	Jane Fairfax’s.—Of	336	” cried Emma feelingly . “
155866	155882	155887	155887	you	2790	” She met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming , “
155987	156135	156136	156136	Harriet	107	” A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done . CHAPTER XI “
156139	156252	156138	156139	poor Harriet!”—Those	337	Harriet!”—Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself — very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much his behaviour as her own , which made her so angry with him . It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet ’s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , “
156264	156437	156255	156255	you	79	”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ’s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend ’s happiness on most insufficient grounds . Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.—“But
156443	156447	156255	156255	you	79	” she added , “
156458	156763	156255	156255	you	79	” She was extremely angry with herself . If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.—Her days of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . This discovery laid many smaller matters open . No doubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane ’s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison . She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet ’s mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.—She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston ’s parting words . “
156815	156944	156947	156948	Miss Woodhouse	80	”—Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted . It was her superior duty . In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself . The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ’s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was approaching Randalls . Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!—But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance . “
156950	156958	156947	156948	Miss Woodhouse	80	” cried Harriet , coming eagerly into the room—“is
156968	156969	156973	156973	you	2796	” “
156976	156998	156973	156973	you	2796	” replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint . “
157072	157073	157066	157066	he	82	” “
157079	157085	157088	157088	he	82	you?”—said Emma , still perplexed . “
157125	157186	157088	157088	he	82	” It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet ’s behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared absolutely changed . She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak . “
157192	157196	157211	157211	she	142	” cried Harriet , “
157227	157228	157211	157211	she	142	” “
157233	157237	157211	157211	she	142	” said Emma , “
157329	157330	157331	157331	Me	0	” “
157333	157342	157331	157331	Me	0	” cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished . “
157358	157359	157360	157360	I	0	” “
157373	157379	157365	157365	you	2796	” replied Emma , smiling ; “
157413	157414	157400	157400	you	2796	” “
157430	157435	157436	157436	Harriet	107	” turning away distressed . “
157438	157446	157448	157448	you	107	” cried Emma , after a moment ’s pause—“What
157463	157529	157454	157454	you	107	” She could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer . Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma ’s . “
157538	157542	157454	157454	you	107	” she began , “
157744	157745	157734	157734	you	0	” “
157748	157754	157769	157769	you	107	” cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely—“Let
157776	157777	157769	157769	you	107	” “
157815	157816	157842	157844	a different person	2806	” “
157820	157828	157842	157844	a different person	2806	” returned Emma , with forced calmness , “
157881	157882	157858	157858	I	0	” “
157893	157894	157885	157886	Miss Woodhouse	80	” “
157979	157980	157983	157983	dear	1023	” “
157985	157989	157983	157983	dear	1023	” cried Harriet , “
158109	158110	158112	158112	God	178	” “
158114	158118	158112	158112	God	178	” cried Emma , “
158134	158135	158136	158136	You	1023	” “
158183	158195	158196	158196	I	0	” She paused a few moments . Emma could not speak . “
158204	158208	158201	158202	Miss Woodhouse	80	” she resumed , “
158377	158401	158403	158403	you	80	” Harriet was standing at one of the windows . Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , “
158414	158415	158403	158403	you	80	” “
158418	158425	158429	158429	I	0	” replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully—“I
158432	159648	159650	159650	he	2814	” Emma ’s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes . A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart . A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress . She touched — she admitted — she acknowledged the whole truth . Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet ’s having some hope of a return ? It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself ! Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . How improperly had she been acting by Harriet ! How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! What blindness , what madness , had led her on ! It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits — some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley — but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ’s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained — or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.—Emma ’s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ’s , but they were not less . Her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create.—She listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to Harriet ’s detail.—Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit — especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley ’s most improved opinion of Harriet . Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ’s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case . She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him — and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet ’s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma . Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ’s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.—The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself — and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . ) He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:—The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield — though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes — and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to her . The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain . On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question . “
159697	159732	159690	159690	Harriet	107	“ Mr. Martin ! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it . ”
159759	159772	159774	159774	she	107	“ I never should have presumed to think of it at first , ”
159776	159834	159774	159774	she	107	“ but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine — and so I have . But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . ”
159866	159906	159860	159860	her	79	“ Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . ”
159965	159981	159949	159949	He	417	“ She could not compose herself — Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed — she had better go;”—with
160015	160026	160011	160011	Emma	79	“ Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! ”
162207	162211	162212	162212	he	82	“ such things , ”
162215	162220	162212	162212	he	82	“ always got about . ”
162546	162564	162566	162567	Mrs. Weston	84	“ On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , ”
162569	162638	162566	162567	Mrs. Weston	84	“ she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ‘ I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart . ”
162639	162643	162645	162645	Emma	79	“ Poor girl ! ”
162647	162663	162645	162645	Emma	79	“ She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? ”
162664	162857	162566	162567	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ‘ The consequence , ’ said she , ‘ has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . ’ ‘ Do not imagine , madam , ’ she continued , ‘ that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . ’ ”
162858	162862	162864	162864	Emma	79	“ Poor girl ! ”
162867	162903	162864	162864	Emma	79	“ She loves him then excessively , I suppose . It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . ”
162904	162919	162566	162567	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . ”
162920	162925	162927	162927	Emma	79	“ I am afraid , ”
162931	162943	162927	162927	Emma	79	“ that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . ”
162944	162995	162996	162996	she	79	“ On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , ”
162999	163193	162996	162996	she	79	“ was that of making her unreasonable . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been — that had been — hard for him to bear . ‘ I did not make the allowances , ’ said she , ‘ which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits — his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ’ She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you — I could not thank you too much — for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . ”
163194	163206	163208	163208	Emma	79	“ If I did not know her to be happy now , ”
163212	163337	163208	163208	Emma	79	“ which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;—for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!—Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good — I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . ”
163432	163457	163458	163458	she	84	“ We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , ”
163493	163501	163503	163504	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Are you well , my Emma ? ”
163509	163536	163503	163504	Mrs. Weston	84	“ Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . ”
164752	164757	164736	164736	She	107	“ How d’ye do ’s ”
164800	164825	164827	164827	he	88	“ He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . ”—She
164988	165008	164975	164975	She	107	“ You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . ”
165009	165013	165015	165015	he	88	“ Have I ? ”
165023	165028	165015	165015	he	88	“ of what nature ? ”
165029	165042	165060	165060	he	88	“ Oh ! the best nature in the world — a wedding . ”
165063	165079	165060	165060	he	88	“ If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . ”
165080	165086	165088	165088	Emma	79	“ How is it possible ? ”
165120	165152	165108	165108	he	88	“ I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . ”
165169	165224	165153	165153	Emma	79	“ You probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it — but—(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . ”
165276	165307	165262	165262	him	88	“ Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent sense — your exertions for your father ’s sake — I know you will not allow yourself—. ”
165326	165337	165315	165315	he	88	“ The feelings of the warmest friendship — Indignation — Abominable scoundrel!”—And
165349	165375	165345	165345	he	88	“ He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for her . She deserves a better fate . ”
165401	165495	165345	165345	he	88	“ You are very kind — but you are mistaken — and I must set you right . — I am not in want of that sort of compassion . My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier . ”
165496	165499	165501	165501	he	88	“ Emma ! ”
165508	165512	165501	165501	he	88	“ are you , indeed?”—but
165514	165641	165345	165345	he	88	himself—“No , no , I understand you — forgive me — I am pleased that you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!—I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt — I could only be certain that there was a preference — and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?—Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . ”
165642	165646	165648	165648	Emma	79	“ Mr. Knightley , ”
165657	165733	165648	165648	Emma	79	confused—“I am in a very extraordinary situation . I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I never have . ”
165788	166058	165782	165782	She	79	“ I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story , probably — a common case — and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding . Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr. Weston — he was continually here — I always found him very pleasant — and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last — my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions . Latterly , however — for some time , indeed — I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself — except that I was not blinded — that it was my good fortune — that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . ”
166112	166197	166109	166109	he	2884	“ I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him . My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no motive for wishing him ill — and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well . ”
166198	166209	166211	166211	Emma	79	“ I have no doubt of their being happy together , ”
166213	166226	166109	166109	he	2884	“ I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached . ”
166227	166235	166237	166238	Mr. Knightley	88	“ He is a most fortunate man ! ”
166243	166540	166237	166238	Mr. Knightley	88	“ So early in life — at three - and - twenty — a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman — the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ’s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,—equality of situation — I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one — and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of her regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment — and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used every body ill — and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a fortunate man indeed ! ”
166541	166550	166607	166607	she	79	“ You speak as if you envied him . ”
166551	166571	166572	166572	Emma	79	“ And I do envy him , Emma . In one respect he is the object of my envy . ”
166639	166693	166631	166632	Mr. Knightley	88	“ You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.—You are wise — but I can not be wise . Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment . ”
166694	166709	166710	166710	she	79	“ Oh ! then , do n’t speak it , do n’t speak it , ”
166714	166727	166758	166758	He	88	“ Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself . ”
166728	166732	166734	166734	he	88	“ Thank you , ”
166836	166845	166847	166847	he	88	“ You are going in , I suppose ? ”
166849	166850	166847	166847	he	88	“ No,”—replied
166863	166877	166861	166861	he	88	spoke—“I should like to take another turn . Mr. Perry is not gone . ”
166887	166961	166861	166861	he	88	added—“I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation — as a friend , indeed , you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like . I will tell you exactly what I think . ”
166962	166965	166966	166967	Mr. Knightley.—“Emma	348	“ As a friend!”—repeated
166967	167034	167035	167035	He	2888	Knightley.—“Emma , that I fear is a word — No , I have no wish — Stay , yes , why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far already for concealment.—Emma , I accept your offer — Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ? ”
167054	167059	167061	167061	he	2888	“ My dearest Emma , ”
167063	167104	167061	167061	he	2888	“ for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour ’s conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma — tell me at once . Say ‘ No , ’ if it is to be said . ”—She
167108	167112	167113	167113	he	2888	nothing.—“You are silent , ”
167120	167131	167113	167113	he	2888	“ absolutely silent ! at present I ask no more . ”
167162	167171	167172	167172	he	2888	“ I can not make speeches , Emma : ”
167191	167321	167172	167172	he	2888	convincing.—“If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more . But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them . The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them . God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes , you see , you understand my feelings — and will return them if you can . At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice . ”
169383	169534	169535	169535	Yours	2920	“ I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface.—We are quite well.—This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.—I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind.—I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not made him ill . “
169538	169541	169544	169545	Mrs. Weston	84	“ A. W. ”
169556	172795	169552	169554	MY DEAR MADAM	1118	“ If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.—You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . My courage rises while I write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.—You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . This was the fact . My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . I shall not discuss it here . For my temptation to think it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—Had she refused , I should have gone mad.—But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing , every thing — to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ’s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.—See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as you were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father ’s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object — but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.—She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I can not say;—when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree.—She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . I can not doubt it . You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account.—Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F — , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her.—The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her . She must tell you herself what she is — yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her.—She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend . I want to have your opinion of her looks . I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars . Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ’s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . If I could but see her again!—But I must not propose it yet . My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.—I must still add to this long letter . You have not heard all that you ought to hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult . , as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose . I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.—But I had no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman — Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself.—I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully . And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W. , in being unpleasant to Miss F. , were highly blameable . She disapproved them , which ought to have been enough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.—She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold . But she was always right . If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.—We quarrelled . — Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?—There every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable . Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected.—I was mad enough , however , to resent.—I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W. , as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.—In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.—‘Jane , ’ indeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with me , I shall soon have done.—She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.—She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each : she dissolved it.—This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ’s death . I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and — may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at — : in short , the full direction to Mr. Smallridge ’s , near Bristol , stared me in the face . I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my uncle . Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different sort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake?—No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks.—I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away . But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ’s uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before . A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good fortune . I hope she is right.—In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL . CHAPTER XV This letter must make its way to Emma ’s feelings . She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold . As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed — and he had suffered , and was very sorry — and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr. Knightley came again , she desired him to read it . She was sure of Mrs. Weston ’s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct . “

172826	172850	172816	172816	I	0	” But that would not do . Mr. Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him . “
172859	172863	172851	172851	I	0	” he replied ; “
172878	172891	172851	172851	I	0	” He began — stopping , however , almost directly to say , “
172929	172949	172950	172950	Humph	357	” He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , “
172982	172983	172976	172976	We	2927	” “
172991	172997	172989	172989	me	0	” he added shortly afterwards , “
173037	173038	173033	173033	you	2923	” “
173048	173059	173060	173060	He	2924	” Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . “
173064	173068	173060	173060	He	2924	” said he , “
173146	173147	173141	173142	Miss Fairfax	142	” “
173154	173158	173141	173142	Miss Fairfax	142	” said Emma , “
173186	173187	173181	173181	you	2923	” “
173218	173290	173211	173211	I	0	” When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud — all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus — “
173395	173422	173423	173423	You	82	” Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ’s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . “
173429	173445	173423	173423	You	82	” said she . He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , “
173527	173561	173515	173515	she	3207	” After this , he made some progress without any pause . Frank Churchill ’s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing . “
173568	173573	173562	173562	I	0	sir,”—was then his remark . “
173587	173626	173580	173580	You	82	” And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ’s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , “
173740	173826	173873	173873	she	3207	” Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable . Her own behaviour had been so very improper ! She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain — no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist . “
173843	173847	173873	173873	she	3207	” was his next observation.—“His
173894	173895	173887	173887	he	548	” “
173910	173911	173914	173914	he	548	” “
173917	173928	173912	173912	I	0	” replied Mr. Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . “
173940	173941	173942	173942	She	3207	” “
173983	173984	173977	173978	Mrs. Elton	195	” “
174023	174024	174025	174025	I	0	” “
174038	174039	174027	174027	you	79	” “
174166	174167	174158	174158	your	79	” “
174212	174213	174202	174202	I	0	” “
174367	174426	174348	174348	I	0	” The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma ’s answer was ready at the first word . “
174449	174828	174443	174443	She	142	” Part only of this answer , however , was admitted . The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to . He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ’s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted . But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father ’s happiness — in other words , his life — required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts . Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . She was sensible of all the affection it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with . She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself . “
174838	174842	174443	174443	She	142	” cried Emma . “
174863	176049	174853	174853	You	2952	” She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded . Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley ’s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt . This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield — the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!—Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy ! She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield . The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from . She would be a loser in every way . Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . In time , of course , Mr. Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early . Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—not like Mr. Elton . Mr. Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than three men in one year . CHAPTER XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . Their intercourse was painful enough by letter . How much worse , had they been obliged to meet ! Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella ’s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss . Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist . Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her — and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.—When it was thus settled on her sister ’s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.—Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse ’s carriage.—It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square . Now Emma could , indeed , enjoy Mr. Knightley ’s visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself . The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard ’s , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma ’s sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself . She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied . There was a communication before her , one which she only could be competent to make — the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well . No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved — and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers . She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—She ought to go — and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . It would be a secret satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went — she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.—She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.—No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , “
176054	176140	174853	174853	You	2952	up;”—and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.—Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted . — She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , “
176172	176418	176419	176419	We	2954	” Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton ’s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand . Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together . Miss Bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity . Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm . She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton ’s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ’s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ’s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , “
176522	176532	176514	176514	I	0	“ For when a lady ’s in the case , “
176541	176599	176618	176618	she	79	” Now I say , my dear , in our case , for lady , read —— mum ! a word to the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits , an’t I ? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—My representation , you see , has quite appeased her . ”
176626	176651	176618	176618	she	79	“ I mentioned no names , you will observe.—Oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . I managed it extremely well . ”
176693	176761	176686	176686	she	79	“ Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?—(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane . ) Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!”—And
176774	176809	176763	176764	Mrs. Bates	106	“ We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.—Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit . ”
176810	176824	176825	176825	she	106	“ I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , ”
176830	176939	176825	176825	she	106	“ since the party to Box Hill . Very pleasant party . But yet I think there was something wanting . Things did not seem — that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken . However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts?—It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not one exception . ”
176985	177062	177064	177064	her	79	“ Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.—It is impossible to say — Yes , indeed , I quite understand — dearest Jane ’s prospects — that is , I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little circle as you find us here.—Yes , indeed.—Charming young man!—that is — so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!”—And
177125	177185	177117	177118	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you . ”
177186	177226	177117	177118	Mrs. Elton	195	“ What ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will be a favour indeed ! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton ’s time is so engaged . ”
177227	177365	177117	177118	Mrs. Elton	195	“ Upon my word it is , Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to night.—There is no end of people ’s coming to him , on some pretence or other.—The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion . They seem not able to do any thing without him.—‘Upon my word , Mr. E. , ’ I often say , ‘ rather you than I.—I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . ’—Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.—However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . ”
177376	177388	177369	177369	her	2961	Emma—“A congratulatory visit , you know.—Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . ”
177399	177435	177389	177390	Miss Bates	101	“ He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.—Mr . E. is Knightley ’s right hand . ”
177449	177464	177436	177436	Emma	79	“ Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk . ”
177465	177513	177389	177390	Miss Bates	101	“ Oh ! no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way . ”
177514	177522	177524	177524	Emma	79	“ Have not you mistaken the day ? ”
177526	177558	177524	177524	Emma	79	“ I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.—Mr . Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday . ”
177559	177572	177389	177390	Miss Bates	101	“ Oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to - day , ”
177589	177593	177594	177594	she	79	side.—“I do believe , ”
177597	177618	177594	177594	she	79	“ this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove . ”
177619	177626	177628	177628	Jane	101	“ Your parish there was small , ”
177630	177652	177628	177628	Jane	101	“ Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of . ”
177653	177699	177594	177594	she	79	“ But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children . ”
177700	177774	177628	177628	Jane	101	“ Ah ! you clever creature , that ’s very true . What a thinking brain you have ! I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together . My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that some people may not think you perfection already.—But hush!—not a word , if you please . ”
177848	177936	177844	177844	her	2166	“ Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience — for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ? ”
177988	177995	177997	177997	he	91	“ When I got to Donwell , ”
177999	178037	177997	177997	he	91	“ Knightley could not be found . Very odd ! very unaccountable ! after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . ”
178038	178041	178043	178043	his	91	“ Donwell ! ”
178044	178068	177997	177997	he	91	wife.—“My dear Mr. E. , you have not been to Donwell!—You mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown . ”
178069	178198	178199	178199	Emma	79	“ No , no , that ’s to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill - usage , ) which made it so much the worse . And then not to find him at home ! I assure you I am not at all pleased . And no apology left , no message for me . The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone . Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.—Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it ? ”
178224	178230	178232	178233	Mrs. Elton	195	“ I can not imagine , ”
178247	178384	178232	178233	Mrs. Elton	195	“ I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it . ”
178385	178391	178393	178394	Mr. Elton	91	“ I met William Larkins , ”
178396	178506	178393	178394	Mr. Elton	91	“ as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him.—William seemed rather out of humour . He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . I have nothing to do with William ’s wants , but it really is of very great importance that I should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose . ”
178597	178655	178588	178588	she	79	“ It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent . ”
178656	178659	178661	178661	Jane	142	“ Oh ! ”
178685	178820	178835	178835	Emma	79	composure—“there would have been no danger . The danger would have been of my wearying you . You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest—. Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to — I have not time for half that I could wish to say . I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . I feel it so very due . But , unfortunately — in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend — ”
178821	178833	178835	178835	Emma	79	“ Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , ”
178843	178872	178835	178835	Emma	79	“ You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even — ”
178873	178910	178835	178835	Emma	79	“ You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know that I must have disgusted you . ”
178911	178967	178835	178835	Emma	79	“ Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side . Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there . I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ? ”
178968	178971	178835	178835	Emma	79	“ Very . ”
178972	178999	178835	178835	Emma	79	“ And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you — just as I begin to know you . ”
179000	179028	178835	178835	Emma	79	“ Oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . ”
179029	179039	179041	179041	Emma	79	“ Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , ”
179043	179054	179041	179041	Emma	79	smiling—“but , excuse me , it must be thought of . ”
179063	179138	179060	179060	Jane	142	“ You are very right ; it has been thought of . And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for . ”
179139	179176	179220	179220	She	79	“ Thank you , thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh ! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!—Good - bye , good - bye . ”
179368	179383	179384	179384	she	79	“ She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , ”
179385	179419	179426	179427	Mr. Knightley	88	continued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ’ Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . ”
179420	179424	179426	179427	Mr. Knightley	88	“ That is , ”
179429	179459	179426	179427	Mr. Knightley	88	“ she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . It will be the only difference . ”
179460	179464	179466	179466	Emma	79	“ Poor child ! ”
179468	179479	179466	179466	Emma	79	“ at that rate , what will become of her ? ”
179480	179542	179543	179543	Emma	79	“ Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . I , who am owing all my happiness to you , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ? ”
179549	179580	179543	179543	Emma	79	“ But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . ”
179581	179718	179466	179466	Emma	79	“ Do you?—I have no doubt . Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor gave you principles . You must have done well . My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . I do not believe I did you any good . The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . ”
179719	179730	179732	179732	Emma	79	“ I am sure you were of use to me , ”
179734	179805	179732	179732	Emma	79	“ I was very often influenced rightly by you — oftener than I would own at the time . I am very sure you did me good . And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . ”
179806	179879	179466	179466	Emma	79	“ How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks—‘Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ’s leave’—something which , you knew , I did not approve . In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . ”
179880	179898	179466	179466	Emma	79	“ What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . ”
179899	179948	179732	179732	Emma	79	“ ‘ Mr. Knightley . ’—You always called me , ‘ Mr. Knightley ; ’ and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal . I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what . ”
179949	179996	179466	179466	Emma	79	“ I remember once calling you ‘ George , ’ in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again . ”
179997	180009	179466	179466	Emma	79	“ And can not you call me ‘ George ’ now ? ”
180010	180047	180048	180048	she	2986	“ Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘ Mr. Knightley . ’ I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise , ”
180054	180091	180048	180048	she	2986	blushing—“I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . ”
180423	180432	180434	180435	Mr. Knightley	88	“ John does not even mention your friend , ”
180437	180450	180434	180435	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Here is his answer , if you like to see it . ”
180499	180509	180511	180512	Mr. Knightley	88	“ John enters like a brother into my happiness , ”
180514	180573	180511	180512	Mr. Knightley	88	“ but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . ”
180574	180582	180584	180584	Emma	79	“ He writes like a sensible man , ”
180593	180662	180584	180584	Emma	79	“ I honour his sincerity . It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . ”
180663	180677	180511	180512	Mr. Knightley	88	“ My Emma , he means no such thing . He only means — ”
180678	180693	180695	180695	she	2997	“ He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , ”
180702	180725	180695	180695	she	2997	smile—“much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . ”
180726	180733	180511	180512	Mr. Knightley	88	“ Emma , my dear Emma — ”
180734	180737	180738	180738	she	2997	“ Oh ! ”
180745	180836	180738	180738	she	2997	“ if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion . Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing you justice . He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine . I wish I may not sink into ‘ poor Emma ’ with him at once.—His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther . ”
180837	180840	180841	180841	he	2997	“ Ah ! ”
180844	180918	180841	180841	he	2997	“ I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together . I am amused by one part of John ’s letter — did you notice it?—where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind . ”
180919	180953	180738	180738	she	2997	“ If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying . He had no idea of me . He seems perfectly unprepared for that . ”
180954	181062	180841	180841	he	2997	“ Yes , yes — but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings . What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so , I suppose . I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day . I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual . I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ‘ Uncle seems always tired now . ’ ”
182095	182111	182083	182083	he	431	saying—“Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way . ”
182310	182321	182323	182323	he	82	“ It is to be a secret , I conclude , ”
182325	182361	182323	182323	he	82	“ These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . ”
182575	182586	182572	182572	he	91	“ the young lady ’s pride would now be contented ; ”
182589	182601	182572	182572	he	91	“ she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; ”
182616	182620	182572	182572	he	91	“ Rather he than I!”—But
182627	182636	182572	182572	he	91	indeed.—“Poor Knightley ! poor fellow!—sad business for him . ”—She
182868	182881	182853	182853	he	88	“ I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . ”
182882	182887	182889	182889	she	79	“ Good or bad ? ”
182899	182911	182889	182889	she	79	“ I do not know which it ought to be called . ”
182912	182932	182853	182853	he	88	“ Oh ! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile . ”
182933	182938	182940	182940	he	88	“ I am afraid , ”
182946	182967	182940	182940	he	88	“ I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . ”
182968	182994	182853	182853	he	88	“ Indeed ! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too . ”
182995	183001	183002	183002	he	88	“ There is one subject , ”
183005	183019	183002	183002	he	88	“ I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . ”
183036	183047	183029	183029	his	88	“ Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet Smith . ”
183068	183078	183080	183080	he	88	“ Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? ”
183082	183094	183080	183080	he	88	“ You have , I believe , and know the whole . ”
183095	183110	183149	183149	her	79	“ No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . ”
183111	183134	183135	183135	Emma	79	“ You are prepared for the worst , I see — and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . ”
183158	183165	183149	183149	her	79	“ No , this is impossible ! ”
183172	183179	183181	183182	Mr. Knightley	88	“ It is so , indeed , ”
183184	183202	183181	183182	Mr. Knightley	88	“ I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . ”
183215	183274	183203	183203	She	79	“ You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . ”
183275	183285	183286	183286	she	79	“ You mistake me , you quite mistake me , ”
183292	183355	183286	183286	she	79	“ It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it . It seems an impossibility!—You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again — yet . You only mean , that he intends it . ”
183356	183365	183367	183368	Mr. Knightley	88	“ I mean that he has done it , ”
183376	183381	183367	183368	Mr. Knightley	88	“ and been accepted . ”
183382	183386	183387	183387	she	79	“ Good God ! ”
183388	183424	183367	183368	Mr. Knightley	88	cried.—“Well!”—Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , “
183473	183474	183463	183463	I	0	” “
183819	183875	183876	183876	Emma	79	” He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad . Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , “
184006	184033	184034	184034	You	79	” He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly — she did — cheerfully answering , “
184127	184128	184106	184106	I	0	” “
184137	184142	184129	184129	You	79	” replied Mr. Knightley ; “
184178	184188	184190	184190	my	0	” Emma could not help laughing as she answered , “
184290	184348	184286	184288	some famous ox	3061	” The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma ’s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet ’s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , “
184363	184386	184360	184361	Robert Martin	112	” that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature . It could not be otherwise . “
184393	184398	184388	184388	you	0	” cried Mr. Knightley . “
184424	184425	184400	184400	you	0	” “
184476	184477	184463	184463	you	0	” “
184483	184491	184463	184463	you	0	” he replied , speaking very distinctly , “
184610	184611	184594	184594	he	112	” “
184617	184626	184612	184612	I	0	” replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , “
184634	184635	184636	184636	You	0	” “
184648	184649	184636	184636	You	0	” “
184663	184664	184660	184661	a fool	1027	” “
184825	184826	184819	184819	she	107	” “
184829	184835	184819	184819	she	107	” cried Emma , shaking her head.—“Ah
184840	185335	184838	184838	Harriet	107	” She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . She was not sorry . She wanted to be alone . Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational . Her father ’s business was to announce James ’s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing . The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet ’s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.—What had she to wish for ? Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . She must laugh at such a close ! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart — such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure in her returning — Every thing would be a pleasure . It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over . The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed . They arrived.—Mrs . Weston was alone in the drawing - room:—but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window . “
185343	185348	185340	185341	Miss Fairfax	142	” said Mrs. Weston . “
185393	185547	185390	185390	I	0	” In half a minute they were in the room . Emma was extremely glad to see him — but there was a degree of confusion — a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure . When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation — or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , “
185594	185595	185590	185590	you	3074	” “
185600	185609	185590	185590	you	3074	” cried Emma , most happy to begin , “
185635	185659	185615	185615	I	0	” He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . “
185666	185676	185679	185679	she	84	” said he , turning his eyes towards Jane . “
185695	185735	185689	185690	Mrs. Weston	84	” But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.—Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . “
185743	185747	185689	185690	Mrs. Weston	84	” she cried , “
185752	185753	185689	185690	Mrs. Weston	84	” “
185757	185761	185764	185764	mine	0	” he answered , “
185793	185794	185789	185789	you	0	” “
185805	185806	185801	185801	I	0	” “
185873	185874	185861	185861	I	0	” “
185883	185887	185861	185861	I	0	” said Emma . “
185893	185897	185888	185888	I	0	” resumed he , “
185983	186004	185979	185979	you	0	” Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , “
186011	186022	185979	185979	you	0	” then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment—“I
186029	186034	186036	186036	you	0	” He paused.—She coloured and laughed.—“I
186082	186122	186072	186080	a man whom I can not presume to praise	3081	” Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were , “
186177	186178	186179	186179	I	0	” “
186186	186192	186179	186179	I	0	” replied Emma , archly ; “
186221	186222	186217	186217	you	0	” “
186237	186254	186234	186234	I	0	” But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying , “
186291	186292	186303	186303	you	0	” “
186318	186319	186313	186316	the most miserable wretch	3085	” “
186393	186397	186383	186383	I	0	” He bowed . “
186404	186416	186383	186383	I	0	” she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , “
186443	186444	186467	186468	no superior	3087	” “
186449	186455	186467	186468	no superior	3087	” he answered , warmly . “
186569	186570	186565	186565	her	3088	” “
186576	186592	186565	186565	her	3088	” replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , “
186634	186764	186620	186620	I	0	” The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ’s appearing not quite well . She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry . Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . “
186844	186851	186852	186852	Perry	102	” Frank Churchill caught the name . “
186854	186874	186852	186852	Perry	102	” said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax ’s eye . “
186903	186941	186897	186897	he	102	” Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane ’s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf . “
186949	186953	186947	186947	mine	0	” he cried . “
187047	187082	187084	187084	you	0	” Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , “

The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced . CHAPTER XIX If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied — unaccountable as it was!—that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness . Harriet was a little distressed — did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ’s approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.—Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley ’s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . But what did such particulars explain?—The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.—Harriet ’s parentage became known . She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.—Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley — or for the Churchills — or even for Mr. Elton!—The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . No objection was raised on the father ’s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet ’s happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;—or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself . Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted.—The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner . Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them , could impair.—Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr. Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November . The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr. Knightley.—They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ’s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan.—John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it . But Mr. Woodhouse — how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?—he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event . When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless.—A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain.—He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it — a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation . Still , however , he was not happy . Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter ’s courage failed . She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated — she could not proceed . In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse ’s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way.—Mrs . Weston ’s poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys — evidently by the ingenuity of man . Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.—Pilfering was housebreaking to Mr. Woodhouse ’s fears.—He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law ’s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life . The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe.—But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November . The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day — and Mr. Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse . The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs. Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own.—“Very
