1441	1464	1435	1435	he	422	“ Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again . What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! ”
1465	1532	1435	1435	he	422	“ I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not . Mr. Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? ”
1533	1566	1435	1435	he	422	“ A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own ? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours , my dear . ”
1567	1605	1435	1435	he	422	“ How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us!—We shall be always meeting ! _ We _ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . ”
1606	1632	1435	1435	he	422	“ My dear , how am I to get so far ? Randalls is such a distance . I could not walk half so far . ”
1633	1655	1435	1435	he	422	“ No , papa , nobody thought of your walking . We must go in the carriage , to be sure . ”
1656	1689	1435	1435	he	422	“ The carriage ! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? ”
1690	1793	1435	1435	he	422	“ They are to be put into Mr. Weston ’s stable , papa . You know we have settled all that already . We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ’s being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . That was your doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place . Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her — James is so obliged to you ! ”
1794	1969	1435	1435	he	422	“ I am very glad I did think of her . It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . He will be able to tell her how we all are . ”

2192	2226	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . ”
2227	2254	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire . ”
2255	2275	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold . ”
2276	2292	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them . ”
2293	2335	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding . ”
2336	2393	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ By the bye — I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ? ”
2394	2407	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! ’ Tis a sad business . ”
2408	2468	2187	2188	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly say ‘ poor Miss Taylor . ’ I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . ”
2469	2486	2488	2488	Emma	124	“ Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! ”
2491	2517	2488	2488	Emma	124	“ That is what you have in your head , I know — and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . ”
2518	2531	2533	2534	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , ”
2540	2552	2533	2534	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . ”
2553	2624	2625	2626	Mr. Knightley	94	“ My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean _ you _ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _ you _ . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know — in a joke — it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another . ”
2701	2709	2711	2712	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Emma knows I never flatter her , ”
2714	2753	2711	2712	Mr. Knightley	94	“ but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer . ”
2754	2757	2759	2759	Emma	124	“ Well , ”
2765	2839	2711	2712	Mr. Knightley	94	pass—“you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day . ”
2840	2849	2851	2852	her father	422	“ Dear Emma bears every thing so well , ”
2854	2887	2851	2852	her father	422	“ But , Mr. Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _ will _ miss her more than she thinks for . ”
2900	2913	2915	2916	Mr. Knightley	94	“ It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion , ”
2918	3021	2915	2916	Mr. Knightley	94	“ We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ’s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ’s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . ”
3022	3034	3036	3036	Emma	124	“ And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , ”
3038	3097	3036	3036	Emma	124	“ and a very considerable one — that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . ”
3111	3145	3101	3101	his	94	“ Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches . ”
3146	3318	3106	3107	Her father	422	“ I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people . It is the greatest amusement in the world ! And after such success , you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no ! Mr. Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful — Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . Oh no ! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again . Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it . “

4115	5374	5375	5375	I	0	” CHAPTER II Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied . Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune — though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate — was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum . It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness . Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best . She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ’s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe . Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ’ marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved . The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ’s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease . Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . A complete change of life became desirable . He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought just employment enough . He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . He had , by that time , realised an easy competence — enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for — enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition . It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished . He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it . He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ’s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age . It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ’s assistance . His father had no apprehension of it . The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston ’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear . He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too . He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved . Now , upon his father ’s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place . There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates , or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit . Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion . For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received . “
5431	5808	5418	5418	he	87	” It was , indeed , a highly prized letter . Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ’s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ’s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston ’s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction — her more than satisfaction — her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ‘ poor Miss Taylor , ’ when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse ’s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , “
5823	8033	5815	5815	She	86	” There was no recovering Miss Taylor — nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse . The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up . His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself . What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ’s eating it . He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry , the apothecary , on the subject . Mr. Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse ’s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many — perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately . With such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone . There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston ’s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it . CHAPTER III Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such . Not unfrequently , through Emma ’s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse ’s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses . Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance . Mrs. Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders . She loved every body , was interested in every body ’s happiness , quicksighted to every body ’s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself . She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School — not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems — and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity — but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies . Mrs. Goddard ’s school was in high repute — and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse ’s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ’s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston . She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody . Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs. Goddard ’s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder . This was all that was generally known of her history . She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her . She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired . She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ’s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging — not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk — and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm . They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell — very creditably , she believed — she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them — but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _ She _ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners . It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers . She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse ’s feelings were in sad warfare . He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : “
8191	8904	8181	8181	I	0	” Emma allowed her father to talk — but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions . Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last ! CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith ’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing . Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . In that respect Mrs. Weston ’s loss had been important . Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs. Weston ’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined . She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs . Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ’s being exactly the young friend she wanted — exactly the something which her home required . Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question . Two such could never be granted . Two such she did not want . It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing . Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell . She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain . Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked — but she could never believe that in the same situation _ she _ should not have discovered the truth . Harriet had no penetration . She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . Mrs. Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation — and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole . But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . Emma encouraged her talkativeness — amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin ’s having “
9039	9455	9459	9460	Mrs. Martin	117	” For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose . She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ’s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it . Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging . He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging . He had his shepherd ’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her . She was very fond of singing . He could sing a little himself . She believed he was very clever , and understood every thing . He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . She believed every body spoke well of him . His mother and sisters were very fond of him . Mrs. Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it , ) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband . Not that she _ wanted _ him to marry . She was in no hurry at all . “
9462	9466	9459	9460	Mrs. Martin	117	” thought Emma . “
9474	9475	9459	9460	Mrs. Martin	117	” “
9539	9540	9531	9532	Miss Richardson	121	” “
9566	9567	9561	9561	He	118	” “
9708	9714	9716	9719	sort of looking man	514	” The next question was — “
9724	9725	9721	9722	Mr. Martin	118	” “
9803	9804	9796	9796	He	118	” “
9931	9932	9926	9926	he	118	” “
9964	9965	9952	9952	he	118	” “
10007	10008	10000	10000	you	516	” “
10042	10043	10000	10000	you	516	” “
10130	10131	10136	10138	Dear Miss Woodhouse	86	” “
10147	10148	10140	10140	he	118	” “
10263	10264	10281	10283	no indoors man	530	” “
10305	10306	10295	10296	Mrs. Martin	117	” “
10430	10431	10438	10438	I	0	” “
10472	10473	10474	10474	You	532	” “
10590	10591	10600	10600	I	0	” “
10712	10977	10995	10995	he	549	” Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love . The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ’s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . They met Mr. Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road . He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion . Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin . His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ’s inclination . Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder . Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose . “
11101	11102	11094	11094	you	96	” “
11171	11172	11159	11159	him	549	” “
11177	11186	11159	11159	him	549	” said Harriet , in a mortified voice , “
11196	11197	11198	11198	I	0	” “
11345	11346	11349	11349	he	118	” “
11388	11389	11390	11391	Mr. Knightley	94	” “
11489	11490	11483	11483	You	113	” “
11516	11517	11507	11508	Mr. Weston	88	” “
11594	11595	11584	11584	he	118	” “
11603	11609	11584	11584	he	118	” replied Harriet rather solemnly . “
11642	11643	11645	11645	he	118	” “
11655	11656	11645	11645	he	118	” “
11753	11754	11755	11755	I	0	” “
11762	11802	11755	11755	I	0	book”—was all Harriet ’s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time . Her next beginning was , “
12053	12461	12045	12045	he	97	” She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable . Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ’s head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet ’s coming to Hartfield . The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency . Mr. Elton ’s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet . He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ’s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy . And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ’s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton ’s admiration . CHAPTER V “
12475	12480	12472	12473	Mrs. Weston	90	” said Mr. Knightley , “
12499	12500	12492	12492	I	0	” “

13013	13020	13009	13009	I	0	” replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , “

13060	13076	13036	13036	Emma	124	that_,”—said Mr. Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . “
13080	13085	13078	13078	I	0	” he soon added , “
13200	13201	13202	13202	I	0	” “

13967	13968	13960	13961	Mr. Knightley	94	” “
13980	13984	13985	13985	I	0	” he replied . “
14064	14065	14067	14067	I	0	” “

14405	14406	14395	14396	Mr. Knightley	94	” “
14411	14415	14395	14396	Mr. Knightley	94	” cried he ; “
14452	14453	14454	14456	Mrs. John Knightley	123	” “
14470	14471	14454	14456	Mrs. John Knightley	123	” “
14475	14479	14454	14456	Mrs. John Knightley	123	” said he , “
14548	14549	14540	14540	I	0	” “
14554	14560	14540	14540	I	0	” said Mrs. Weston gently , “
14564	14565	14566	14566	She	124	” “
14662	14663	14648	14648	nobody	3141	” “
14682	14687	14648	14648	nobody	3141	” said Mrs. Weston , “
14748	14806	14744	14744	I	0	” Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston ’s on the subject , as much as possible . There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma ’s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to “
14820	15021	14809	14809	Weston	88	” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield . CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ’s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton ’s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ’s side , as there could be any occasion for . She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton ’s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . She had no scruple with regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ’s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . “
15032	15036	15037	15037	you	639	” said he ; “
15077	15078	15079	15079	I	0	” “
15128	15129	15122	15122	I	0	” “
15139	15146	15147	15147	I	0	” said the gallant Mr. Elton — “
15175	15176	15147	15147	I	0	” “
15200	15201	15147	15147	I	0	” “
15222	15223	15224	15224	I	0	” “
15231	15278	15224	15224	I	0	” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ’s picture . “
15289	15293	15295	15295	you	0	” said she : “
15302	15325	15295	15295	you	0	” Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naïveté , “
15334	15347	15295	15295	you	0	” No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , “
15459	15460	15462	15462	me	0	” “
15466	15471	15462	15462	me	0	” cried Mr. Elton ; “
15545	15587	15529	15530	Mrs. Weston	90	” Yes , good man!—thought Emma — but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? You know nothing of drawing . Do n’t pretend to be in raptures about mine . Keep your raptures for Harriet ’s face . “
15648	15649	15643	15643	one	483	” “
15701	15702	15708	15709	Mr. Elton	97	” “
15751	15752	15729	15729	you	0	” “
15784	16082	15778	15778	she	113	” Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn . She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . She played and sang;—and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of . She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . There was merit in every drawing — in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . They were both in ecstasies . A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ’s performances must be capital . “
16091	16095	15778	15778	she	113	” said Emma . “
16420	16433	16436	16436	my	0	last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length—“my
16524	16535	16497	16497	Weston	90	side”—after all this , came poor dear Isabella ’s cold approbation of—“Yes
16665	16682	16686	16686	wives	666	” Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , “
16706	16899	16702	16702	husbands	665	” with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer . She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr. John Knightley ’s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . But there was no doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere . It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . “
16938	17205	16934	16935	Miss Smith	113	” Mr. Elton was only too happy . Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ’s sketch to wish to go on . There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both — a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton ’s very promising attachment was likely to add . Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . “
17224	17281	17210	17210	We	675	” The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy . Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . “
17292	17308	17210	17210	We	675	wanted,”—observed Mrs. Weston to him — not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.—“The
17340	17341	17335	17335	she	113	” “
17347	17351	17343	17343	you	676	” replied he . “
17393	17394	17390	17390	you	676	” “
17404	17427	17402	17402	Emma	124	” said Mr. Knightley . Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , “
17500	17501	17552	17552	she	113	” “
17507	17512	17552	17552	she	113	” said Mr. Woodhouse . “
17580	17581	17575	17575	she	113	” “
17606	17607	17575	17575	she	113	” “
17622	17623	17624	17624	You	682	” “
17633	17638	17626	17626	sir	3156	” cried Mr. Elton , “
17717	17833	17710	17710	I	0	” The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December . But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was always on the alert . “
17880	17881	17882	17882	He	0	” “
17901	17966	17882	17882	He	0	world,”—brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . “
17972	17985	17986	17987	This man	685	” said he with a tender sigh , as he received it . “
17997	18001	18002	18002	I	0	” thought Emma . “
18093	18287	18086	18086	his	685	” CHAPTER VII The very day of Mr. Elton ’s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ’s services towards her friend . Harriet had been at Hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . Half a minute brought it all out . She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard ’s , that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr. Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . “
18365	18382	18347	18347	she	688	” Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful . “
18387	18391	18347	18347	she	688	” she cried , “
18416	18417	18407	18407	He	3246	” “
18424	18428	18419	18419	you	0	” cried Harriet . “
18437	18546	18434	18434	you	0	” Emma was not sorry to be pressed . She read , and was surprized . The style of the letter was much above her expectation . There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a “
18551	18560	18434	18434	you	0	” and was at last forced to add , “
18573	18574	18434	18434	you	0	” “
18584	18588	18593	18593	Harriet	113	” replied Emma rather slowly—“so
18755	18756	18744	18744	Harriet	113	” “
18759	18764	18744	18744	Harriet	113	” said the still waiting Harriet;—“well
18774	18775	18778	18778	you	0	” “
18794	18795	18786	18786	you	0	” “

18949	18956	18940	18940	You	0	” said Harriet , looking down . “
19034	19049	19022	19022	you	113	” Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : “
19061	19062	19058	19058	I	0	” “
19104	19105	19106	19106	I	0	” “

19151	19191	19139	19139	I	0	” said Harriet , contemplating the letter . For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , “
19298	19299	19292	19292	I	0	” “
19385	19386	19375	19375	you	113	” “
19392	19399	19401	19401	I	0	” said Emma , smiling graciously , “
19496	19558	19492	19492	you	113	” The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said — “
19609	19610	19603	19603	you	96	” “
19747	19765	19743	19743	you	113	” Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . “
19773	19780	19766	19766	You	113	” she cried , looking aghast . “
19830	19831	19809	19809	I	0	” “
19871	19872	19864	19864	I	0	” “
19895	19896	19886	19886	me	0	” “
19945	19946	19935	19935	He	3246	” “
19959	19969	19947	19947	I	0	” said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; “
20122	20123	20125	20125	you	113	” “
20171	20172	20128	20128	you	113	” “
20183	20199	20128	20128	you	113	” Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a “
20239	20240	20128	20128	you	113	” “
20284	20500	20281	20281	I	0	” Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . The business was finished , and Harriet safe . She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton . “
20512	20521	20501	20501	I	0	” was said in rather a sorrowful tone . “
20557	20558	20540	20540	You	724	” “
20580	20587	20588	20588	I	0	” Some time afterwards it was , “
20631	20632	20626	20629	a linen - draper	728	” “
20734	20781	20719	20719	I	0	” Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin . “
20789	20794	20783	20783	he	732	” said she softly . “
20830	20831	20819	20819	I	0	” “
20847	20851	20836	20845	those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed	738	” cried Emma . “
20902	20903	20904	20904	My	0	” “
20916	20917	20919	20919	he	97	” “
21021	21240	21243	21243	I	0	” Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger . CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night . For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard ’s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose . Mr. Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other . “
21320	21321	21322	21322	My	0	” “
21334	21335	21322	21322	My	0	” “
21372	21373	21374	21374	You	0	” “
21382	21383	21374	21374	You	0	” “
21430	21431	21433	21433	you	0	” “
21472	21522	21459	21459	I	0	” Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before . “
21533	21537	21523	21523	I	0	” said he ; “
21579	21580	21581	21581	I	0	” “
21601	21602	21593	21593	I	0	” “
21605	21609	21610	21610	you	0	” said he , “
21646	21647	21640	21640	she	758	” “
21693	21694	21683	21683	You	0	” “
21707	21708	21701	21701	you	0	” “
21723	21724	21713	21713	She	758	” “
21736	21737	21732	21733	some visitors	763	” “
21742	21743	21744	21744	Harriet	113	” “
21755	21778	21752	21752	you	0	” Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing . He presently added , with a smile , “
21814	21815	21802	21804	your little friend	764	” “
21825	21826	21827	21830	A very serious sort	765	” “
21836	21840	21827	21830	A very serious sort	765	” still smiling . “
21865	21903	21904	21904	I	0	” Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton ’s having dropt a hint . Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him . “
21910	21914	21904	21904	I	0	” he replied , “
21965	21966	21967	21967	He	118	” “
21972	21976	21967	21967	He	118	” said Emma ; “
21988	21989	21982	21982	Harriet	113	” “
22355	22356	22338	22338	she	784	” “
22362	22380	22359	22360	Mr. Knightley	94	” said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , “
22393	22394	22386	22387	Mr. Martin	118	” “
22397	22403	22386	22387	Mr. Martin	118	” replied he , surprized , “
22426	22427	22419	22419	she	784	” “
22430	22434	22435	22435	I	0	” said she , “
22465	22501	22458	22458	he	118	” This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , “
22521	22522	22516	22518	the foolish girl	788	” “
22529	22533	22516	22518	the foolish girl	788	” cried Emma , “
22568	22569	22552	22553	A man	557	” “
22609	22610	22611	22611	I	0	” “
22619	22620	22611	22611	I	0	” “
22644	22645	22637	22637	You	0	” “
22731	22732	22761	22761	he	118	” “
22738	22758	22761	22761	he	118	” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , “
23143	23144	23145	23145	I	0	” “
23308	23309	23273	23274	Mr. Martin	118	” “
23329	23330	23321	23327	a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer	814	” “
23450	23451	23446	23448	Mr. Robert Martin	118	” “
23458	23463	23446	23448	Mr. Robert Martin	118	” said Mr. Knightley , “
23695	23726	23691	23691	he	118	” It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . “
24018	24019	24021	24021	my	0	” “
24057	24058	24054	24054	you	124	” “
24063	24068	24054	24054	you	124	” cried she playfully . “
24178	24179	24180	24180	I	0	” “
24190	24196	24198	24198	I	0	” said Mr. Knightley presently , “
24479	24480	24461	24461	she	113	” “
24727	24728	24713	24720	nothing but a gentleman in education and manner	868	” “
24739	24742	24713	24720	nothing but a gentleman in education and manner	868	” cried Mr. Knightley.—“Robert
24772	24916	24917	24918	Robert Martin	118	” Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma ’s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer . He was thinking . The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . “
25008	25017	25022	25022	Elton	97	” Emma laughed and disclaimed . He continued , “
25178	25179	25180	25180	I	0	” “
25188	25195	25186	25186	you	97	” said Emma , laughing again . “
25262	25263	25228	25228	Harriet	113	” “
25267	26096	26098	26098	she	879	you,”—said he , rising and walking off abruptly . He was very much vexed . He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly . Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ’s , than in his . She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ’s wrong , as Mr. Knightley . He walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her . She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives . Harriet ’s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young man ’s coming to Mrs. Goddard ’s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ’s friendship and woman ’s feelings would not justify . He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley ’s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives . Mr. Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton . Harriet ’s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight . Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard ’s to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr. Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _ very _ _ particular _ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _ lady _ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits . Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , “
26150	26624	26139	26140	Mr. Elton	97	” CHAPTER IX Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself . He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . She was sorry , but could not repent . On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton ’s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet ’s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin ’s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend ’s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow . It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ’s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs. Goddard ’s , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse ’s help , to get a great many more . Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity . Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . “
26655	26661	26662	26662	Kitty	134	” And it always ended in “
26670	26908	26662	26662	Kitty	134	” His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter . It was by no means his daughter ’s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition . Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade , My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin’d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal . — made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already . “
26922	26926	26912	26912	you	886	” said she ; “
26944	26945	26966	26968	The stupidest fellow	888	” “
26976	26979	26980	26981	Miss Smith	113	Woodhouse”—he stopt a moment—“or
26986	27058	26980	26981	Miss Smith	113	” The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . “
27070	27074	27059	27059	I	0	” said he . “
27105	27153	27174	27174	your	890	” The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand . There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ’s . He was gone the next moment:—after another moment ’s pause , “
27157	27168	27174	27174	your	890	” said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet—“it
27177	27373	27174	27174	your	890	” But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself . To Miss — — CHARADE . My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! But ah ! united , what reverse we have ! Man ’s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye ! She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , “
27564	27598	27604	27605	Miss Woodhouse?—what	892	” She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet ’s wondering questions . “
27761	27762	27752	27752	you	96	” “
27974	28024	27941	27941	Harriet	113	” Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness . She could not speak . But she was not wanted to speak . It was enough for her to feel . Emma spoke for her . “
28039	28043	28060	28060	his	97	” said she , “
28278	28279	28280	28282	Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and	138	” “
28282	28283	28280	28282	Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and	138	Woodhouse!”—and “
28288	28345	28284	28286	Dear Miss Woodhouse	138	” was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought . Mr. Elton ’s superiority had very ample acknowledgment . “
28353	28357	28347	28347	you	925	” cried Harriet , “
28442	28443	28444	28444	I	0	” “
28499	28500	28513	28513	I	0	” “

29154	29155	29156	29156	I	0	” “
29178	29199	29156	29156	I	0	” Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . “
29205	29215	29156	29156	I	0	” said she , presently — her cheeks in a glow—“to
29270	29286	29315	29316	Miss Woodhouse	138	” Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin ’s prose . “
29291	29293	29315	29316	Miss Woodhouse	138	” continued Harriet—“these
29325	29326	29315	29316	Miss Woodhouse	138	” “

29584	29627	29628	29628	I	0	” Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . “
29641	29645	29628	29628	I	0	” said she . “
29649	29653	29675	29676	my father	3164	” replied Emma ; “
29736	29741	29730	29730	me	0	” Harriet looked grave . “

29882	29906	29879	29879	you	113	” Mr. Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “
29924	29925	29928	29928	papa	3131	” “
29972	30030	29965	29965	we	952	” She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded — and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion . “
30086	30106	30084	30084	Emma	124	” Emma only nodded , and smiled.—After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , “
30241	30242	30234	30234	you	113	” “
30272	30273	30266	30266	Garrick	144	” “
30348	30349	30326	30326	you	113	” “
30389	30390	30391	30391	I	0	” “
30453	30454	30439	30439	she	89	” “
30466	30467	30461	30461	papa	3131	” “
30495	30496	30485	30485	I	0	” “
30514	30515	30502	30503	Mrs. Weston	90	” “
30545	30546	30502	30503	Mrs. Weston	90	” “
30645	30646	30618	30619	Mr. Knightley	94	” “
30669	30707	30660	30660	Isabella	89	” Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley ’s claims on his brother , or any body ’s claims on Isabella , except his own . He sat musing a little while , and then said , “
30755	30756	30759	30759	papa	3131	” “
30791	30847	30781	30781	Isabella	89	” This was too true for contradiction . Unwelcome as it was , Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ’s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them . “
30906	30907	30896	30896	she	113	” “
30939	30940	30937	30937	Harriet	113	” “
30960	30961	30952	30952	I	0	” “
31114	31115	31102	31102	I	0	” “
31122	31126	31116	31116	He	1010	” said Emma , “
31201	31202	31193	31194	The children	3304	” “
31223	31224	31205	31206	their uncle	1016	” “
31272	31273	31292	31292	papa	3131	” “
31282	31283	31292	31292	papa	3131	” “
31308	31530	31294	31298	One half of the world	1021	” Later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o’clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again . Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push — of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse ’s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield . If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him — had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come . Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber . He re - urged — she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it — “
31596	31620	31586	31586	I	0	” Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say . He looked rather doubtingly — rather confused ; said something about “
31621	31662	31663	31663	You	1023	honour,”—glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively . With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said , “
31702	31703	31704	31704	I	0	” “
31711	31725	31726	31726	I	0	” replied Mr. Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; “
31796	32055	31784	31784	he	889	” After this speech he was gone as soon as possible . Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet ’s share . CHAPTER X Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury . Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr. Elton . A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be . It had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.—Emma ’s remark was — “
32073	32077	31764	31764	I	0	”—Harriet ’s was — “
32097	32098	32091	32092	Miss Nash	119	” “
32110	32118	32099	32099	I	0	” said Emma , as they proceeded , “
32152	32207	32208	32208	I	0	” Harriet , she found , had never in her life been inside the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr. Elton ’s seeing ready wit in her . “
32215	32219	32208	32208	I	0	” said she ; “
32249	32272	32246	32247	my father	3164	” She pondered , but could think of nothing . After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again — “
32300	32308	32297	32297	you	86	” — Emma laughed , and replied , “
32364	32365	32367	32367	you	86	” “
32377	32378	32379	32379	I	0	” “
32456	32457	32449	32449	I	0	” “
32470	32472	32465	32466	a woman	3225	” — “
32622	32623	32615	32615	I	0	” “
32639	32640	32629	32631	an old maid	1047	” “
32725	32726	32710	32710	I	0	” “
32743	32744	32733	32735	an old maid	1047	” “
32987	32988	32975	32975	nobody	3141	” “
33008	33009	33000	33000	you	0	” “
33243	33244	33238	33239	a niece	1069	” “
33272	33273	33269	33269	you	0	” “
33418	33574	33412	33412	she	149	” They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded . Emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse . She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will . In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away , “
33631	33632	33594	33594	appear!—I	1080	” “
33636	33640	33641	33642	Poor creatures	1082	” said Harriet . “
33651	33652	33644	33644	one	483	” “
33667	33701	33656	33656	I	0	” said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again . “
33709	33731	33702	33702	I	0	” stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within . “
33738	33781	33702	33702	I	0	” said her companion . They walked on . The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr. Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther , “
33859	33865	33977	33977	I	0	” Harriet could just answer , “
33872	33939	33977	33977	I	0	” before the gentleman joined them . The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting . He had been going to call on them . His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them . “
33953	33957	33977	33977	I	0	” thought Emma ; “
34006	34429	33999	33999	I	0	” Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road . But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ’s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her . This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ’s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . Mr. Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them . Mr. Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ’s party at his friend Cole ’s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the celery , the beet - root , and all the dessert . “
34442	34448	33999	33999	I	0	” was her consoling reflection ; “
34480	34577	34472	34472	I	0	” They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more . She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort . “
34585	34589	34472	34472	I	0	” said she , “
34659	34926	34639	34640	your housekeeper	1092	” Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it . It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious . “
34932	34936	34937	34937	he	1093	” thought Emma ; “
34953	36100	36103	36104	my dear	3137	” Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event . CHAPTER XI Mr. Elton must now be left to himself . It was no longer in Emma ’s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures . The coming of her sister ’s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected — she did not herself expect — that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers . They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . She hardly wished to have more leisure for them . There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves . Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella ’s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety . The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them . Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible . She could never see a fault in any of them . She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry . They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance . Mr. John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour . He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased . The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his . He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law . Nothing wrong in him escaped her . She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself . Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella ’s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . There he had not always the patience that could have been wished . Mr. Woodhouse ’s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed . It did not often happen ; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for Emma ’s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not . The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality . They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ’s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last . “
36106	36110	36103	36104	my dear	3137	” said he , “
36121	36122	36112	36113	Miss Taylor	86	” “
36128	36135	36112	36113	Miss Taylor	86	” cried she with ready sympathy , “
36183	36184	36181	36181	sir	3156	” “
36208	36227	36191	36191	I	0	” Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls . “
36260	36261	36256	36256	his	150	” “
36270	36276	36256	36256	his	150	” was the handsome reply . “
36288	36303	36279	36279	you	3156	” asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.—“Not
36316	36317	36320	36320	papa	3131	” “
36468	36469	36442	36442	Mr.	1107	” “
36476	36482	36442	36442	Mr.	1107	” said Mr. John Knightley , “
36561	36562	36556	36556	you	89	” “
36569	36572	36556	36556	you	89	” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes
36608	36609	36599	36599	she	90	” “
36630	36631	36627	36628	Mr. Weston	88	” “
36637	36643	36632	36632	I	0	” said John Knightley pleasantly , “
36723	36724	36725	36725	Me	0	” “
36730	36743	36725	36725	Me	0	” cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part . — “
36936	36937	36933	36934	Miss Taylor	86	” “
36944	36949	36933	36934	Miss Taylor	86	” said John Knightley . “
36963	36964	36951	36951	he	3246	” “
36972	36976	36965	36965	He	3246	” replied Emma . “
37005	37006	37001	37001	him	3246	” “
37019	37024	37025	37025	He	3246	” said her father . “
37089	37090	37078	37078	He	3246	” “
37109	37110	37095	37095	he	3246	” “
37220	37221	37228	37228	him	3246	” “
37230	37240	37228	37228	him	3246	” cried the good - hearted Mrs. John Knightley . “
37327	37328	37329	37329	Nobody	3141	” “
37341	37348	37335	37336	the Churchills	102	” observed Mr. John Knightley coolly . “
37456	37848	37869	37869	women	1041	” Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass . She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ’s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important.—It had a high claim to forbearance . CHAPTER XII Mr. Knightley was to dine with them — rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ’s first day . Emma ’s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation . She hoped they might now become friends again . She thought it was time to make up . Making - up indeed would not do . _ She _ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _ he _ would never own that he had . Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her — the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ’s arms . It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , “
37891	37892	37894	37894	you	0	” “
37940	37941	37907	37907	women	1041	” “

37962	37966	37907	37907	women	1041	” said he , smiling—“and
37980	37981	37970	37970	I	0	” “
37987	37989	37970	37970	I	0	” she replied—“and

38037	38038	37970	37970	I	0	” “

38147	38149	38137	38137	she	1161	” she cried—“very
38237	38238	38227	38228	Mr. Martin	118	” “
38247	38255	38227	38228	Mr. Martin	118	” was his short , full answer . “
38267	38286	38257	38257	I	0	” This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and “
38293	38295	38291	38291	George	126	” and “
38302	38641	38300	38300	you	94	” succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing — and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong . The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness . While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . “
38647	38673	38300	38300	you	94	” said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children—“How
38740	38809	38730	38730	Emma	124	” Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;—and two basins only were ordered . After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , “
38841	38842	38831	38831	I	0	” “
38882	38883	38859	38859	He	154	” “
38944	38945	38935	38935	I	0	” “
38950	38962	38963	38963	I	0	” cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , “
39018	39019	39013	39013	he	108	” “
39032	39033	39028	39028	he	108	” “
39112	39113	39115	39116	Mrs. Perry	106	” “
39158	39159	39147	39147	He	108	” “
39207	39208	39199	39199	him	108	” “
39268	39269	39253	39254	Mr. Wingfield	154	” “
39306	39319	39321	39321	Emma	124	“ You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , ”
39323	39333	39321	39321	Emma	124	“ I have not heard one inquiry after them . ”
39334	39403	39321	39321	Emma	124	“ Oh ! the good Bateses — I am quite ashamed of myself — but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs. Bates — I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.—They are always so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they , sir ? ”
39404	39430	39321	39321	Emma	124	“ Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago . ”
39431	39474	39321	39321	Emma	124	“ How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy — except when it has been quite an influenza . ”
39475	39529	39321	39321	Emma	124	“ That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . ”
39530	39548	39321	39321	Emma	124	“ No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except — “
39601	39602	39605	39605	indeed—_we	1195	” “
39715	39716	39700	39700	Wingfield	154	” “
39780	39781	39782	39782	I	0	” “
39913	39924	39908	39909	Mr. Knightley	94	” turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband . “
39947	39948	39938	39940	Mr. John Knightley	94	” “
39960	39971	39955	39955	you	0	” cried Mr. John Knightley , hearing his own name . “
40025	40026	40018	40019	Mr. Wingfield	154	” “
40029	40031	40035	40035	yourself	0	Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray
40059	40060	40061	40061	I	0	” “
40073	40077	40067	40067	you	0	” cried Emma , “
40113	40179	40106	40108	the old prejudice	1219	” And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ’s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising . “
40187	40191	40106	40108	the old prejudice	1219	” said Mrs. John Knightley.—“It
40285	40296	40275	40275	She	149	” Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , “
40330	40331	40332	40332	I	0	” “
40358	40526	40354	40354	Emma	124	” This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said — much praise and many comments — undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;—but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin . Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . Here was a dangerous opening . “
40529	40553	40354	40354	Emma	124	” said Mr. Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma ’s ear expressed , “
40578	40625	40626	40626	I	0	” And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with , “
40646	40647	40626	40626	I	0	” “
40669	40670	40651	40651	you	124	” “
40712	40713	40700	40700	Perry	108	” “
40797	40798	40777	40777	he	154	” “
40884	40885	40882	40882	Perry	108	” “
40913	40914	40921	40921	Perry	108	” “
40994	41032	41033	41034	Mr. Perry	108	” Emma ’s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ’s breaking out . “
41036	41048	41033	41034	Mr. Perry	108	” said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , “
41117	41135	41137	41138	Mr. Perry	108	” He paused — and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , “
41186	41187	41184	41184	himself	108	” “
41192	41200	41190	41190	true	1253	” cried Mr. Knightley , with most ready interposition—“very
41332	42033	42046	42046	her	1258	” Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it . CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister . She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly . It was a delightful visit;—perfect , in being much too short . In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas . Mr. Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party . How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter ’s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also . Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse ’s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing . The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house . Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears . Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard ’s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton ’s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard ’s door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid — of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield — they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together . Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ’s complaint;—“a
42084	42098	42063	42064	Mrs. Goddard	111	” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed , “
42151	42218	42147	42147	Perry	108	” Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard ’s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards — as if quite another subject , “
42381	42478	42358	42358	I	0	” Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her ’s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “
42486	42516	42517	42517	You	97	” and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening . “
42522	42524	42527	42527	your	97	” said she;—“we
42535	42626	42532	42533	Mrs. Weston	90	” But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton ’s only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing ; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . “
42629	42635	42532	42533	Mrs. Weston	90	” said she to herself , “
42789	42911	42912	42912	I	0	” Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard ’s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with — “
42961	42962	42963	42964	Mr. Elton	97	” “
42971	42975	42963	42964	Mr. Elton	97	” replied Emma ; “
43039	43040	43055	43055	he	97	” “
43043	43054	43055	43055	he	97	” said Mr. John Knightley presently , with some slyness , “
43069	43070	43071	43071	Me	0	” “
43073	43082	43084	43084	you	97	” she replied with a smile of astonishment , “
43094	43095	43084	43084	you	97	” “
43127	43128	43117	43117	you	124	” “
43138	43139	43129	43130	Mr. Elton	97	” “
43205	43206	43207	43207	I	0	” “
43233	43538	43539	43540	A man	557	” and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more . Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time . Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour . The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent . “
43542	43546	43554	43554	himself	557	” said he , “
43802	43829	44027	44027	my	0	” Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the “
43836	43990	44027	44027	my	0	” which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips . They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr. Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly . Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her . She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , “
43998	43999	44001	44001	My	0	” “
44009	44014	44001	44001	My	0	” said she presently , “
44031	44049	44027	44027	my	0	” His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . “
44139	44143	44115	44115	I	0	” Emma smiled and answered—“My
44190	44191	44178	44179	Mr. Perry	108	” “
44204	44205	44206	44206	He	108	” “
44252	44253	44206	44206	He	108	” “
44264	44316	44206	44206	He	108	” This was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . “
44322	44326	44206	44206	He	108	” said he , “
44416	44417	44413	44413	I	0	” “
44420	44425	44413	44413	I	0	” said John Knightley , “
44438	44439	44427	44427	I	0	” “
44443	44448	44413	44413	I	0	” observed Mr. Elton . “
44572	44592	44593	44593	I	0	” Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , “
44606	44644	44645	44645	We	1297	” At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton ’s spirits for other feelings . Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party . “
44652	44656	44645	44645	We	1297	” continued he , “
44804	44805	44806	44806	I	0	” “
44825	44826	44818	44818	I	0	” “
44880	44881	44882	44882	My	0	” “
44886	44900	44882	44882	My	0	” replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , “
44911	45394	44882	44882	My	0	” CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston ’s drawing - room;—Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill - humour . Mr. Elton must smile less , and Mr. John Knightley more , to fit them for the place.—Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was . To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons . Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ’s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each . This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day ’s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton ’s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost . The misfortune of Harriet ’s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ’s coming , and of Emma ’s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma . Emma ’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of “
45423	45576	45577	45578	my son	1324	insufferable!”—Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet ’s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton ’s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words “
45580	45582	45583	45583	Frank	104	” and “
45585	45587	45588	45589	my son	1324	” and “
45591	45962	45588	45589	my son	1324	” repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma ’s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her . She had frequently thought — especially since his father ’s marriage with Miss Taylor — that if she _ were _ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ’ imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton ’s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross — and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her , “
46044	46074	46075	46075	He	104	” Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete . “
46084	46089	46075	46075	He	104	” continued Mr. Weston , “
46156	46157	46141	46141	I	0	” “
46191	46192	46182	46182	she	90	” “
46456	46457	46437	46437	she	1340	” “
46472	46476	46458	46458	I	0	” replied Emma ; “
46506	46507	46502	46502	you	1339	” “
46664	46744	46644	46644	she	1340	” Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy — yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming . — Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : “
46794	46795	46777	46778	Mr. Weston	88	” “
46826	46827	46810	46811	Mrs. Churchill	100	” “
46831	46838	46810	46811	Mrs. Churchill	100	” replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , “
46846	46857	46810	46811	Mrs. Churchill	100	” Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before—“You
46951	46952	46944	46944	her	100	” “
46964	46968	46961	46962	Mrs. Churchill	100	” replied Isabella : “
47045	47202	47039	47039	she	100	” Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . But at present there was nothing more to be said . Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room . To be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure . Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable . While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , “
47248	47249	47039	47039	she	100	” “
47356	47357	47350	47351	Mr. Weston	88	” “
47363	47367	47350	47351	Mr. Weston	88	” said Emma . “
47469	47470	47471	47471	One	483	” “
47495	47500	47471	47471	One	483	” replied Mrs. Weston . “
47556	47557	47541	47541	she	1365	” “
47638	47639	47640	47640	My	0	” “
47708	47717	47718	47718	I	0	” Emma listened , and then coolly said , “
47728	47729	47730	47730	He	1373	” “
47742	47747	47730	47730	He	1373	” continued Mrs. Weston , “
47788	47996	47998	47998	she	1379	” CHAPTER XV Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation . Mr. Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in . Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa . He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them . Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles . He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend — her fair , lovely , amiable friend . “
48029	48267	48270	48270	she	1381	” And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him . But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet’s — more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present — to entreat her to _ promise _ _ him _ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was vexed . It did appear — there was no concealing it — exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , “
48327	48328	48318	48318	she	1381	” “
48334	48338	48344	48344	herself	1381	” he continued , “
48405	48584	48395	48395	I	0	” Emma saw Mrs. Weston ’s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : “
48616	48685	48686	48686	I	0	” Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer . Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . “
48695	48699	48688	48688	your	1387	” said he , “
48798	48960	48785	48785	I	0	” Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away . As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . “
48975	49128	49129	49129	You	1399	” was Mr. Woodhouse ’s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time . To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little . His eldest daughter ’s alarm was equal to his own . The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them . “
49140	49144	49129	49129	You	1399	” said she ; “
49224	49225	49202	49202	you	1399	” “
49228	49232	49202	49202	you	1399	” replied he . “
49283	49597	49598	49598	Your	1407	” Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan . Mrs. Weston could only approve . Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr. Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother ’s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence . He had gone beyond the sweep — some way along the Highbury road — the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep — in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over . He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend . To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father ’s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls . He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus — “
49611	49612	49613	49613	I	0	” “
49622	49623	49613	49613	I	0	” “
49630	49631	49625	49625	I	0	” “
49636	49758	49759	49759	He	1408	” And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for . A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . “
49811	50261	50262	50262	I	0	” and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage . Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tête - à - tête drive . It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . But now , she would rather it had not happened . She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston ’s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense . To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up — her hand seized — her attention demanded , and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping — fearing — adoring — ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . It really was so . Without scruple — without apology — without much apparent diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _ her _ lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all . Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , “
50314	50315	50316	50317	Miss Smith!—message	169	” “
50324	50350	50322	50322	she	113	mean!”—And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , “
50411	50517	50528	50528	You	97	” But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects . He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer . As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , “
50625	50626	50627	50628	Good Heaven	171	” “
50630	50635	50627	50628	Good Heaven	171	” cried Mr. Elton , “
50813	50879	50806	50806	you	97	” It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this — which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton ’s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed — “
50901	50902	50895	50895	you	97	” “
50907	50911	50895	50895	you	97	” cried Emma , “
51057	51058	51049	51049	you	3156	” “
51063	51072	51049	51049	you	3156	” cried he , affronted in his turn : “
51190	51191	51187	51187	I	0	” “
51323	51784	51314	51314	I	0	” He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane — turning a corner which he could never bear to think of — and in strange hands — a mere common coachman — no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem — if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel — perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of all . Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken — more in error — more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself . “
51816	51925	51814	51814	Harriet	113	” How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet — never ! She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion . She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it . His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled . The picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the charade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet . To be sure , the charade , with its “
51927	51930	51803	51803	He	768	wit”—but then the “
51932	52871	51814	51814	Harriet	113	eyes”—in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth . Who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ? Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ’s friend . To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility . There was no denying that those brothers had penetration . She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr. Elton ’s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service . She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes . He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . There had been no real affection either in his language or manners . Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . She need not trouble herself to pity him . He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten . But — that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ) , to marry him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking . Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind . The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family — and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _ he _ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers . The first error and the worst lay at her door . It was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple . She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . “
52876	52880	52874	52874	I	0	” said she , “
53091	53656	53086	53089	a pert young lawyer	1430	” She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ’s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him — that Harriet ’s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive — and that there could be no necessity for any body ’s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ’s being given a moment ’s uneasiness about it . These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present . The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church . Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton ’s absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them , — “
53674	53948	53950	53950	he	1432	” These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield . He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body . But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease . CHAPTER XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr. Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;—which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness . The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton ’s best compliments , “
54040	55171	54027	54028	Mr. Woodhouse	87	” Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr . Elton ’s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . She had not even a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not mentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ’s suspicion . It did , however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude . She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark . She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ’s return . She went to Mrs. Goddard ’s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding — to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred — and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame — and the sight of Harriet ’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . Harriet bore the intelligence very well — blaming nobody — and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend . Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ’s side , not her own . Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved him — and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible . Her tears fell abundantly — but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ’s eyes — and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding — really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two — and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ’s claims , was to promote Harriet ’s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts . Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ’s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton ’s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness — and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . If Mr. Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three . Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society . They must encounter each other , and make the best of it . Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard ’s ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself . CHAPTER XVIII Mr. Frank Churchill did not come . When the time proposed drew near , Mrs. Weston ’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . For the present , he could not be spared , to his “
55195	55636	55180	55180	he	1435	” Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed — much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . It soon flies over the present failure , and begins to hope again . For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ’s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner . These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs. Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself . Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill ’s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls . The acquaintance at present had no charm for her . She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston ’s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship . She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away . She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs. Weston ’s arguments against herself . “

58046	58246	58030	58030	He	104	” said Mr. Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry . To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . VOLUME II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma ’s opinion , had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet ’s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—“Mr
58256	58602	58248	58248	Elton	97	” she found something else must be done . They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates . She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers . There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency — but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time — tiresome women — and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them . But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in — observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax . The house belonged to people in business . Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse ’s health , cheerful communications about her mother ’s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet—“Mrs
58675	58898	58657	58657	she	1520	” The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton . There was intimacy between them , and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his going away . Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ’ ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ’s being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties . She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece . “
59097	59113	59093	59093	she	107	” Emma ’s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest — “
59134	59135	59137	59137	you	182	” “
59144	59156	59139	59139	You	182	” replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh
59537	59566	59567	59567	You	1531	” All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax ’s handwriting . “
59572	59580	59567	59567	You	1531	” replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; “
59630	59634	59628	59628	Ma’am	185	” addressing her , “
59651	59727	59639	59640	Miss Woodhouse	96	” And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it . She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ’s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention . “

60506	60549	60491	60491	Jane	149	” At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ’s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr. Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , “
60598	60599	60595	60596	Mrs. Campbell	160	” “
60831	60832	60828	60829	Mr. Dixon	188	” “

61596	61607	61608	61608	father	1588	” said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise—“My
61678	63216	63223	63223	her	1591	” And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded . She regained the street — happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax ’s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself . CHAPTER II Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates ’s youngest daughter . The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of the — — regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad — of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards — and this girl . By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the foundling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations . But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life . These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power . When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ’s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ’s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ’s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell ’s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ’s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was Jane Fairfax ’s history . She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ’s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters . Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . The evil day was put off . It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ’s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn . This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever . The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did . As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness:—what must be at last , had better be soon . Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment . She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ’s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it — Mr. Frank Churchill — must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ’ absence . Emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But “
63303	63983	63984	63984	She	1596	” These were her reasons — she had no better . It was a dislike so little just — every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ’ interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance . Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face — her features — there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it:—elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury . There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit . In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon ’s affections from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . These were charming feelings — but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , “
63995	64393	64395	64395	he	1597	” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane ’s offences rose again . They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion . Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon ’s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises . There probably _ was _ something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr. Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds . The like reserve prevailed on other topics . She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time . It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was . “
64396	64407	64499	64499	her;—but	1600	handsome?”—“She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . ”
64408	64411	64395	64395	he	1597	“ Was he agreeable?”—“He
64417	64418	64499	64499	her;—but	1600	” “
64431	64486	64420	64420	he	1597	information?”—“At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing . ”
64603	64609	64610	64610	he	94	“ A very pleasant evening , ”
64635	64732	64610	64610	he	94	away;—“particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma . You left nothing undone . I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ’s , it must have been a real indulgence . ”
64733	64740	64742	64742	Emma	124	“ I am happy you approved , ”
64746	64764	64742	64742	Emma	124	“ but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . ”
64765	64771	64773	64774	her father	422	“ No , my dear , ”
64777	64830	64773	64774	her father	422	“ _ that _ I am sure you are not . There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . If any thing , you are too attentive . The muffin last night — if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough . ”
64831	64834	64836	64837	Mr. Knightley	94	“ No , ”
64845	64869	64836	64837	Mr. Knightley	94	“ you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore . ”
64873	64879	64881	64881	she	124	expressed—“I understand you well enough ; ”
64885	64891	64881	64881	she	124	“ Miss Fairfax is reserved . ”
64892	64936	64773	64774	her father	422	“ I always told you she was — a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . What arises from discretion must be honoured . ”
64937	64949	64881	64881	she	124	“ You think her diffident . I do not see it . ”
64950	64955	64957	64957	he	94	“ My dear Emma , ”
64969	64989	64957	64957	he	94	“ you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . ”
64990	65016	64881	64881	she	124	“ Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained . ”
65017	65022	64957	64957	he	94	“ I am disappointed , ”
65028	65038	65044	65044	his	87	“ I hope every body had a pleasant evening , ”
65048	65169	65044	65044	his	87	“ I had . Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way . I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed . She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . ”
65170	65184	65187	65187	his	1605	“ True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . ”
65214	65249	65250	65251	Mr. Knightley	94	“ She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one ’s eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . ”
65286	65435	65273	65274	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished — but it is so little one can venture to do — small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon — Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate — Hartfield pork is not like any other pork — but still it is pork — and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork — I think we had better send the leg — do not you think so , my dear ? ”
65436	65487	65273	65274	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter . I knew you would wish it . There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . ”
65488	65573	65273	65274	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ That ’s right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . ”
65574	65577	65579	65580	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Emma , ”
65583	65613	65579	65580	Mr. Knightley	94	“ I have a piece of news for you . You like news — and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . ”
65614	65639	65640	65640	He	94	“ News ! Oh ! yes , I always like news . What is it?—why do you smile so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls ? ”
65647	65661	65640	65640	He	94	“ No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , ”
65721	65774	65698	65699	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse — I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . ”
65811	65822	65824	65825	Mr. Knightley	94	“ There is my news:—I thought it would interest you , ”
65844	65854	65856	65857	Miss Bates	107	“ But where could _ you _ hear it ? ”
65859	66066	65856	65857	Miss Bates	107	“ Where could you possibly hear it , Mr. Knightley ? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole ’s note — no , it can not be more than five — or at least ten — for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out — I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork — Jane was standing in the passage — were not you , Jane?—for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ‘ Shall I go down instead ? for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen . ’—‘Oh ! my dear , ’ said I — well , and just then came the note . A Miss Hawkins — that ’s all I know . A Miss Hawkins of Bath . But , Mr. Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . A Miss Hawkins — ”
66067	66102	66166	66167	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3953	“ I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago . He had just read Elton ’s letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly . ”
66103	66156	66166	66167	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3953	“ Well ! that is quite — I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . My dear sir , you really are too bountiful . My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her . ”
66157	66164	66166	66167	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3953	“ We consider our Hartfield pork , ”
66167	66192	66166	66167	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3953	Woodhouse—“indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I can not have a greater pleasure than — ”
66193	66273	66166	66167	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3953	“ Oh ! my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us . If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us . We may well say that ‘ our lot is cast in a goodly heritage . ’ Well , Mr. Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well — ”
66274	66291	66166	66167	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3953	“ It was short — merely to announce — but cheerful , exulting , of course . ”
66301	66355	66166	66167	Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed	3953	“ He had been so fortunate as to — I forget the precise words — one has no business to remember them . The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled . ”
66356	66364	66366	66366	Emma	124	“ Mr. Elton going to be married ! ”
66375	66387	66366	66366	Emma	124	“ He will have every body ’s wishes for his happiness . ”
66388	66396	66398	66399	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ He is very young to settle , ”
66403	66434	66398	66399	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ He had better not be in a hurry . He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . ”
66435	66446	66448	66449	Miss Bates	107	“ A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! ”
66453	66500	66448	66449	Miss Bates	107	“ my mother is so pleased!—she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress . This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . ”
66517	66527	66528	66528	she	107	“ No — I have never seen Mr. Elton , ”
66536	66546	66528	66528	she	107	“ is he — is he a tall man ? ”
66547	66554	66556	66556	Emma	124	“ Who shall answer that question ? ”
66558	66618	66556	66556	Emma	124	“ My father would say ‘ yes , ’ Mr. Knightley ‘ no ; ’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . ”
66619	66841	66528	66528	she	107	“ Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man — But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry . Miss Hawkins,—I dare say , an excellent young woman . His extreme attention to my mother — wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know — it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it — the warm bath — but she says it did him no lasting benefit . Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel . And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . It is such a happiness when good people get together — and they always do . Now , here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys — I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry . I say , sir , ”
66847	66896	66844	66845	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ I think there are few places with such society as Highbury . I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.—My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork — a roast loin of pork — ”
66897	66918	66920	66920	Emma	124	“ As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , ”
66922	66950	66920	66920	Emma	124	“ nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . ”
66969	67035	66966	66966	Emma	124	“ You are silent , Miss Fairfax — but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ’s account — we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . ”
67036	67044	67046	67046	Jane	149	“ When I have seen Mr. Elton , ”
67048	67088	67046	67046	Jane	149	“ I dare say I shall be interested — but I believe it requires _ that _ with me . And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . ”
67089	67107	67109	67110	Miss Bates	107	“ Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , ”
67112	67292	67109	67110	Miss Bates	107	“ four weeks yesterday.—A Miss Hawkins!—Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever — Mrs. Cole once whispered to me — but I immediately said , ‘ No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man — but’—In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired — Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley . I mean in person — tall , and with that sort of look — and not very talkative . ”
67293	67308	67046	67046	Jane	149	“ Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . ”
67309	67352	67109	67110	Miss Bates	107	“ Very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . One takes up a notion , and runs away with it . Mr. Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? ”
67353	67374	67046	67046	Jane	149	“ Handsome ! Oh ! no — far from it — certainly plain . I told you he was plain . ”
67375	67397	67046	67046	Jane	149	“ My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself — ”
67398	67442	67109	67110	Miss Bates	107	“ Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking . But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain . ”
67443	67641	67642	67642	Emma	124	“ Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole ’s ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly — I would not have you out in a shower!—We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _ boiled _ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very!—I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!—Good morning to you . ”
67855	67868	67832	67832	Harriet	113	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! ”
67916	68054	68057	68065	the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper	1616	“ She had set out from Mrs. Goddard ’s half an hour ago — she had been afraid it would rain — she had been afraid it would pour down every moment — but she thought she might get to Hartfield first — she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford’s . ”—Ford
68082	68751	68057	68065	the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper	1616	place.—“And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps — when , all of a sudden , who should come in — to be sure it was so very odd!—but they always dealt at Ford’s — who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door — Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door!—Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.—Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse — well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me—(do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came forward — came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said — I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away — and then — only think!—I found he was coming up towards me too — slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered — and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n’t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole ’s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables — I believe I did — but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . ”
68962	68972	68974	68974	she	113	“ It might be distressing , for the moment , ”
68976	69015	69016	69016	Harriet	113	“ but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over — and may never — can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . ”
69019	69023	69025	69025	she	113	“ very true , ”
69026	69033	69036	69036	she	113	“ would not think about it ; ”
71993	72001	72010	72011	the man	768	“ master nor mistress was at home ; ”
72019	72025	72027	72027	Emma	124	“ This is too bad , ”
72034	72055	72027	72027	Emma	124	“ And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so disappointed . ”
72147	72279	72140	72141	Mr. Weston	88	“ How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father — glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow — I had a letter this morning — we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty — he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . ”
72454	72464	72466	72466	he	88	“ I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , ”
72490	72500	72502	72502	she	124	“ We had better move on , Mr. Weston , ”
72504	72511	72502	72502	she	124	“ we are detaining the girls . ”
72512	72519	72475	72475	she	124	“ Well , well , I am ready;”—and
72525	72559	72475	72475	she	124	“ but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:”—though
72591	72607	72609	72610	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o’clock , ”
72626	72638	72640	72641	Mr. Weston	88	“ Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three , ”
72725	72736	72704	72704	she	124	“ Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”—was
72814	72820	72821	72821	she	124	“ My dear , dear anxious friend,”—said
72835	72873	72821	72821	she	124	“ always overcareful for every body ’s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . ”
72885	72939	72940	72940	She	124	“ ’ Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon . ”
73190	73196	73198	73199	Mr. Weston	88	“ I told you yesterday , ”
73203	73277	73198	73199	Mr. Weston	88	“ I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ’s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . ”
73278	73291	73293	73295	the young man	3246	“ It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it , ”
73297	73326	73293	73295	the young man	3246	“ though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _ home _ I felt I might do any thing . ”
73523	73557	73489	73489	He	3246	inquiries,—“Was she a horsewoman?—Pleasant rides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large neighbourhood?—Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough?—There were several very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls — had they balls?—Was it a musical society ? ”
73706	73712	73713	73713	he	3246	“ His father ’s marriage , ”
73716	73754	73713	73713	he	3246	“ had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him . ”
73841	73852	73854	73854	he	3246	“ Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , ”
73856	73901	73854	73854	he	3246	“ but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . ”
73902	73917	73919	73919	Emma	124	“ You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , ”
73921	73972	73919	73919	Emma	124	“ were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Do n’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . ”
73973	73981	73982	73982	he	1721	“ I hope I should know better , ”
73985	74022	73982	73982	he	1721	“ no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . ”
74347	74383	74343	74344	Mr. Weston	88	move.—“He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford ’s , but he need not hurry any body else . ”
74401	74519	74343	74344	Mr. Weston	88	“ As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name — I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ? ”
74520	74527	74529	74530	his father	3231	“ To be sure we do , ”
74532	74583	74343	74344	Mr. Weston	88	“ Mrs. Bates — we passed her house — I saw Miss Bates at the window . True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is . Call upon her , by all means . ”
74584	74595	74597	74599	the young man	3246	“ There is no necessity for my calling this morning , ”
74601	74620	74597	74599	the young man	3246	“ another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which — ”
74621	74728	74729	74730	The son	3187	“ Oh ! go to - day , go to - day . Do not defer it . What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided . You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . If you do not call early it will be a slight . ”
74734	74744	74746	74746	Emma	124	“ I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , ”
74748	74757	74746	74746	Emma	124	“ she is a very elegant young woman . ”
74768	74771	74774	74774	her	124	“ Yes , ”
74810	74822	74824	74824	she	124	“ If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , ”
74826	74872	74824	74824	she	124	“ I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her — no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . ”
74873	74887	74889	74890	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? ”
74902	74974	74889	74890	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . ”
74975	74993	74824	74824	she	124	“ My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . ”
74994	75067	75068	75070	Mr. Frank Churchill	104	“ But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . ”
75093	75137	75083	75084	his father	3231	“ My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates ’s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . ”
75266	75310	75313	75314	Mrs. Weston	90	Highbury.—“He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . ”—Highbury
76325	76330	76307	76307	Emma	124	“ Yes , oh ! yes”—he
76333	76494	76307	76307	Emma	124	“ I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him — but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . ”
76495	76505	76574	76574	Emma	124	“ And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? ”
76506	76573	76307	76307	Emma	124	“ Ill , very ill — that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most deplorable want of complexion . ”
76592	76634	76635	76635	He	1775	“ It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . ”
76712	76715	76717	76717	Emma	124	“ Well , ”
76719	76734	76717	76717	Emma	124	“ there is no disputing about taste.—At least you admire her except her complexion . ”
76740	76750	76737	76737	his	1775	laughed.—“I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion . ”
76751	76768	76737	76737	his	1775	“ Did you see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in the same society ? ”
76783	76886	76779	76779	he	1775	“ Ha ! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford ’s . If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford ’s . It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say they sell gloves . ”
76887	76946	76947	76947	They	1780	“ Oh ! yes , gloves and every thing . I do admire your patriotism . You will be adored in Highbury . You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr. Weston ’s son — but lay out half a guinea at Ford ’s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . ”
76961	76965	76737	76737	his	1775	“ Men ’s Beavers ”
76967	76970	76737	76737	his	1775	“ York Tan ”
76981	77047	76779	76779	he	1775	said—“But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _ amor _ _ patriae _ . Do not let me lose it . I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life . ”
77048	77067	76779	76779	he	1775	“ I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . ”
77068	77125	76980	76980	he	1781	“ And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . It is always the lady ’s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow . ”
77126	77188	76779	76779	he	1775	“ Upon my word ! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her . ”
77189	77260	76779	76779	he	1775	“ May I , indeed?—Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . I met her frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs. Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman . I like them all . ”
77261	77281	76980	76980	he	1781	“ You know Miss Fairfax ’s situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? ”
77282	77289	76779	76779	he	1775	“ Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do . ”
77290	77299	77301	77302	Mrs. Weston	90	“ You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , ”
77305	77338	77301	77302	Mrs. Weston	90	“ remember that I am here.—Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax ’s situation in life . I will move a little farther off . ”
77339	77351	77353	77353	Emma	124	“ I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , ”
77355	77370	77353	77353	Emma	124	“ as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . ”
77398	77413	77415	77416	Frank Churchill	104	“ Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? ”
77418	77423	77425	77425	Emma	124	“ Ever hear her ! ”
77427	77455	77415	77416	Frank Churchill	104	“ You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly . ”
77456	77617	77375	77375	he	1782	“ You think so , do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ’s performance.—I have been used to hear her ’s admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman — engaged to her — on the point of marriage — would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead — never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof . ”
77618	77622	77624	77624	Emma	124	“ Proof indeed ! ”
77627	77664	77624	77624	Emma	124	amused.—“Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . ”
77665	77686	77375	77375	he	1782	“ Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . ”
77687	77763	77375	77375	he	1782	“ Certainly — very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . I could not excuse a man ’s having more music than love — more ear than eye — a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ? ”
77764	77775	77375	77375	he	1782	“ It was her very particular friend , you know . ”
77776	77780	77782	77782	Emma	124	“ Poor comfort ! ”
77786	77848	77782	77782	Emma	124	“ One would rather have a stranger preferred than one ’s very particular friend — with a stranger it might not recur again — but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . ”
77849	77873	77375	77375	he	1782	“ You are right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it . ”
77874	77938	77375	77375	he	1782	“ So much the better — or so much the worse:—I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her — quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling — there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . ”
77939	77948	77375	77375	he	1782	“ As to that — I do not — ”
77949	78009	77375	77375	he	1782	“ Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ’s sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses . ”
78010	78022	78023	78023	he	1785	“ There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all — ”
78034	78109	78023	78023	he	1785	“ however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were — how it might all be behind the scenes . I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be . ”
78110	78226	77375	77375	he	1782	“ I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve — I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . ”
78227	78237	78239	78239	he	1786	“ It is a most repulsive quality , indeed , ”
78241	78271	78239	78239	he	1786	“ Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in reserve , but no attraction . One can not love a reserved person . ”
78272	78389	78390	78390	He	1786	“ Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ’s reserve to procure one . Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question . I have no reason to think ill of her — not the least — except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . ”
78996	79006	78980	78980	her	124	“ all young people would have their little whims . ”
79307	79317	79303	79304	Mrs. Weston	90	“ all young people would have their little whims . ”
79439	79453	79428	79428	himself	1816	“ Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . ”
79940	79960	79933	79934	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , ”
80150	80158	80140	80140	her	113	“ of course it must be declined , ”
80230	80282	80287	80287	she	113	“ They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . ”
80399	80409	80577	80578	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I am not fond of dinner - visiting , ”
80411	80573	80577	80578	Mrs. Weston	90	he—“I never was . No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us — take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . ”
80585	80605	80577	80578	Mrs. Weston	90	reproach—“Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . ”
80606	80611	80613	80614	Mr. Weston	88	“ Well , sir , ”
80616	80654	80613	80614	Mr. Weston	88	“ as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . ”
80717	80768	80706	80707	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole . ”
80769	80938	80676	80677	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him . We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . ”
80939	80956	80706	80707	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? ”
80957	80990	80706	80707	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise . ”
80991	80998	81000	81001	Mr. Weston	88	“ But , my dear sir , ”
81003	81018	81000	81001	Mr. Weston	88	“ if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . ”
81019	81028	81030	81031	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ And no great harm if it does , ”
81033	81044	81030	81031	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ The sooner every party breaks up , the better . ”
81045	81161	80706	80707	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma ’s going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ’s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ’s in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years . ”
81162	81307	81030	81031	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious — Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . ”
81308	81422	80706	80707	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time — and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up . ”
81632	81764	81625	81625	Emma	124	“ I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.—It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.—No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . ”
82125	82134	82136	82136	she	124	“ This is coming as you should do , ”
82138	82149	82136	82136	she	124	“ like a gentleman.—I am quite glad to see you . ”
82156	82211	82150	82150	He	94	“ How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . ”
82212	82336	82150	82150	He	94	“ Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . _ Now _ you have nothing to try for . You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than any body else . _ Now _ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . ”
82337	82341	82343	82343	his	1861	“ Nonsensical girl ! ”
82799	82806	82808	82809	Mrs. Cole	182	“ One can suppose nothing else , ”
82811	82881	82808	82809	Mrs. Cole	182	“ and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her . ”
82943	83211	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought — or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . ”
83241	83247	83249	83249	she	182	“ Why do you smile ? ”
83251	83258	83249	83249	she	182	“ Nay , why do you ? ”
83259	83281	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell ’s being so rich and so liberal.—It is a handsome present . ”
83282	83285	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ Very . ”
83286	83297	83249	83249	she	182	“ I rather wonder that it was never made before . ”
83298	83311	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . ”
83312	83341	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument — which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . ”
83342	83362	83249	83249	she	182	“ That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates ’s house . ”
83363	83391	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ You may _ say _ what you chuse — but your countenance testifies that your _ thoughts _ on this subject are very much like mine . ”
83392	83454	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ I do not know . I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve . I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ? ”
83455	83464	83249	83249	she	182	“ What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? ”
83465	83543	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ’s scheme than an elderly man ’s . It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say . I told you that your suspicions would guide mine . ”
83544	83563	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _ Mr _ . Dixon in them . ”
83564	83608	83249	83249	she	182	“ Mr. Dixon.—Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . ”
83609	83851	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _ her _ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ’s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her ’s . I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are . ”
83852	83887	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . Mr. Dixon ’s preference of her music to her friend ’s , I can answer for being very decided . ”
83888	83919	83249	83249	she	182	“ And then , he saved her life . Did you ever hear of that?—A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . He caught her . ”
83920	83933	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ He did . I was there — one of the party . ”
83934	83968	83212	83213	Miss Woodhouse	86	“ Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries . ”
83969	84075	83249	83249	she	182	“ I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.—It was the work of a moment . And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable — indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again — yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . ”
84142	84187	84139	84139	Emma	124	“ The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . ”
84188	84210	84394	84394	he	1881	“ And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells . ”
84211	84281	84394	84394	he	1881	“ No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business . ”
84282	84378	84139	84139	Emma	124	“ Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . ”
84779	84786	84787	84788	Mrs. Weston	90	“ my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . ”
84987	85004	85006	85006	she	124	“ He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naïveté . ”
85008	85036	85006	85006	she	124	“ Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . ”
85516	85525	85527	85527	he	104	“ I have made a most wretched discovery , ”
85535	85585	85527	85527	he	104	“ I have been here a week to - morrow — half my time . I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!—I hate the recollection . ”
85586	85612	85527	85527	he	104	“ Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut . ”
85613	85616	85618	85618	he	104	“ No , ”
85622	85651	85618	85618	he	104	“ that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . ”
85717	85723	85725	85725	she	124	“ What is the matter ? ”
85730	85737	85738	85738	he	104	“ Thank you for rousing me , ”
85741	85837	85738	85738	he	104	“ I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way — so very odd a way — that I can not keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I?—Yes , I will — I declare I will — and you shall see how she takes it;—whether she colours . ”
85906	85916	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	“ This is the luxury of a large party , ”
85918	85978	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	she:—“one can get near every body , and say every thing . My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you . I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh . Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ? ”
85979	85988	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	“ How?—They were invited , were not they ? ”
85989	86005	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Oh ! yes — but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their coming ? ”
86006	86019	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	“ They walked , I conclude . How else could they come ? ”
86020	86333	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Very true.—Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . Poor girl ! I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage . You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ‘ Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!’—but with many , many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr. Knightley ’s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again . ’ I was quite surprized;—very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention — and so thoughtful an attention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of . And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . ”
86334	86338	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Very likely , ”
86340	86463	85903	85904	Mrs. Weston	90	Emma—“nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing — to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ’s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to - day — for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . ”
86464	86467	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Well , ”
86474	86559	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax . See the consequence of keeping you company!—What do you say to it ? ”
86560	86567	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! ”
86571	86645	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?—Mr . Knightley!—Mr . Knightley must not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh ! no , no , Henry must have Donwell . I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley ’s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . ”
86646	86724	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match — I do not want to injure dear little Henry — but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ’s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? ”
86725	86769	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr . Knightley marry!—No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women ! ”
86770	86789	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . ”
86790	86799	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ But the imprudence of such a match ! ”
86800	86813	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . ”
86814	86930	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax — and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!—Oh ! no , no;—every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing . ”
86931	86961	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Imprudent , if you please — but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . ”
86962	87051	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry?—He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother ’s children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . ”
87052	87076	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax — ”
87077	87115	86469	86470	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but — ”
87116	87119	87121	87122	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Well , ”
87126	87146	87121	87122	Mrs. Weston	90	“ perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home . ”
87147	87273	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! ’ And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ’s old petticoat . ‘ Not that it was such a very old petticoat either — for still it would last a great while — and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ’ ”
87274	87526	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he takes in her — his anxiety about her health — his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me — this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody — though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ? I can not help suspecting him . I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . ”
87527	87565	87121	87122	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously . ”
87566	87599	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . ”
87600	87621	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . ”
87622	87663	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner . ”
87664	87722	86569	86569	Emma	124	“ You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment — I believe nothing of the pianoforte — and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . ”
88329	88335	88337	88337	she	124	“ I often feel concern , ”
88339	88384	88337	88337	she	124	“ that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose . ”
88385	88398	88399	88399	he	94	“ Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , ”
88400	88411	88413	88413	he	94	replied;—“but you must often wish it , I am sure . ”
88430	88437	88413	88413	he	94	“ This present from the Campbells , ”
88439	88446	88337	88337	she	124	she—“this pianoforte is very kindly given . ”
88447	88450	88451	88451	he	94	“ Yes , ”
88459	88501	88451	88451	he	94	embarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her notice of it . Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell . ”
88561	88566	88568	88568	he	94	“ That will do , ”
88576	88589	88568	88568	he	94	aloud—“you have sung quite enough for one evening — now be quiet . ”
88600	88620	88568	88568	he	94	“ One more;—they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more . ”
88629	88657	88622	88623	Frank Churchill	104	“ I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . The strength of the song falls on the second . ”
88663	88667	88669	88669	he	94	“ That fellow , ”
88673	88689	88669	88669	he	94	“ thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . This must not be . ”
88700	88730	88731	88732	Miss Bates	107	near—“Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? Go , and interfere . They have no mercy on her . ”
89108	89115	89117	89118	Frank Churchill	104	“ Perhaps it is as well , ”
89128	89150	89121	89121	he	104	“ I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after yours . ”
89421	89437	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! ”
89438	89463	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Do n’t class us together , Harriet . My playing is no more like her ’s , than a lamp is like sunshine . ”
89464	89510	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Oh ! dear — I think you play the best of the two . I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . ”
89511	89552	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax ’s is much beyond it . ”
89553	89615	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . ”
89616	89628	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . ”
89629	89722	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it . And I hate Italian singing.—There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ? ”
89723	89733	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Just as they always do — very vulgar . ”
89734	89740	89742	89742	Harriet	113	“ They told me something , ”
89746	89755	89742	89742	Harriet	113	“ but it is nothing of any consequence . ”
89775	89789	89772	89773	Mr. Elton	97	“ They told me — that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday . ”
89790	89793	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Oh ! ”
89794	89813	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner . ”
89814	89817	89772	89773	Mr. Elton	97	“ Oh ! ”
89818	89856	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox . I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer . ”
89857	89874	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . ”
89875	89910	89772	89773	Mr. Elton	97	“ She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . He sat by her at dinner . Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . ”
89911	89928	89399	89399	Harriet	113	“ Very likely.—I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . ”
90283	90290	90292	90292	she	124	“ For my companion tells me , ”
90294	90342	90292	90292	she	124	“ that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now . ”
90343	90360	90362	90363	Frank Churchill	104	“ And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , ”
90365	90383	90362	90363	Frank Churchill	104	“ to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield — if you are going home . ”
90389	90406	90384	90385	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased . ”
90407	90480	90292	90292	she	124	“ Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps — I may be equally in the way here . Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ? ”
90481	90492	90494	90494	Emma	124	“ I am here on no business of my own , ”
90496	90532	90494	90494	Emma	124	“ I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument . ”
90533	90612	90292	90292	she	124	“ Well — if you advise it.—But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone — what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . ”
90613	90622	90292	90292	she	124	“ I do not believe any such thing , ”
90624	90668	90292	90292	she	124	Emma.—“I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax ’s opinion last night . ”
90669	90675	90677	90678	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Do come with me , ”
90680	90737	90677	90678	Mrs. Weston	90	“ if it be not very disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long . We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to call with me . It will be felt so great an attention ! and I always thought you meant it . ”
90841	90853	90855	90856	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	225	“ Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard ’s , ma’am ? ”
90856	90944	90855	90856	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	225	Ford.—“Yes — no — yes , to Mrs. Goddard ’s . Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield . No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please . But then , Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the pattern gown home any day . But I shall want the ribbon directly — so it had better go to Hartfield — at least the ribbon . You could make it into two parcels , Mrs. Ford , could not you ? ”
90945	90964	90855	90856	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	225	“ It is not worth while , Harriet , to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels . ”
90965	90971	90855	90856	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	225	“ No more it is . ”
90972	90981	90983	90986	the obliging Mrs. Ford	207	“ No trouble in the world , ma’am , ”
90988	91056	90983	90986	the obliging Mrs. Ford	207	“ Oh ! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one . Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s — I do not know — No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night . What do you advise ? ”
91057	91081	90855	90856	Mrs. Ford.—“Yes	225	“ That you do not give another half - second to the subject . To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs. Ford . ”
91082	91091	91093	91093	Harriet	113	“ Aye , that will be much best , ”
91098	91114	91093	91093	Harriet	113	“ I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard ’s . ”
91139	91145	91147	91148	the latter	1970	“ My dear Miss Woodhouse , ”
91150	91216	91147	91148	the latter	1970	“ I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith . How do you do , Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding . ”
91217	91227	91125	91126	two ladies	1969	“ I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are — ”
91228	91823	91824	91824	Emma	124	“ Very well , I am much obliged to you . My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night . How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad to hear such a good account . Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh ! then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her — and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.—‘Aye , pray do , ’ said Mr. Frank Churchill , ‘ Miss Woodhouse ’s opinion of the instrument will be worth having . ’—But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh , ’ said he , ‘ wait half a minute , till I have finished my job;’—For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ’s spectacles.—The rivet came out , you know , this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had no use of her spectacles — could not put them on . And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress ’s spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always — I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present — and she really eats nothing — makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats — so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before — I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us . ”
91827	91839	91824	91824	Emma	124	“ very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , ”
91860	91925	91856	91857	Miss Bates	107	“ How do you do , Mrs. Ford ? I beg your pardon . I did not see you before . I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . Jane came back delighted yesterday . Thank ye , the gloves do very well — only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in . ”
91926	91933	91935	91935	she	124	“ What was I talking of ? ”
91961	92883	92884	92885	Miss Bates	107	“ I declare I can not recollect what I was talking of.—Oh ! my mother ’s spectacles . So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill ! ‘ Oh ! ’ said he , ‘ I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . ’—Which you know shewed him to be so very .... Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .... I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could .... ‘ Oh ! ’ said he , ‘ I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively . ’ I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ‘ Oh ! ’ said he directly , ‘ there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life . ’ That , you know , was so very .... And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice — only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times — but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell — some of Mr. Knightley ’s most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees — I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day — for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ‘ I am sure you must be , ’ said he , ‘ and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing . ’ So I begged he would not — for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left — it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me — No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had ; he had brought them all — and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ’s profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very .... I wanted to keep it from Jane ’s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . ”
92921	92992	92915	92915	her	107	“ Pray take care , Mrs. Weston , there is a step at the turning . Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase — rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss Smith , pray take care . Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning . ”
93084	93090	93092	93092	he	1978	“ This is a pleasure , ”
93100	93129	93092	93092	he	1978	“ coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . ”
93130	93133	93135	93136	Mrs. Weston	90	“ What ! ”
93138	93162	93135	93136	Mrs. Weston	90	“ have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . ”
93163	93171	93172	93172	he	1978	“ I have not been working uninterruptedly , ”
93175	93239	93240	93240	He	1978	“ I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe . You see we have been wedging one leg with paper . This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . ”
93427	93434	93436	93437	Frank Churchill	104	“ Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , ”
93445	93523	93436	93437	Frank Churchill	104	“ the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ’s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not you think so ? ”
93549	93555	93557	93557	Emma	124	“ It is not fair , ”
93563	93575	93557	93557	Emma	124	“ mine was a random guess . Do not distress her . ”
93604	93706	93600	93600	he	1981	“ How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax . I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument ’s coming to hand . Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? ”
93722	93732	93734	93734	she	1982	“ Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell , ”
93743	93758	93734	93734	she	1982	“ I can imagine nothing with any confidence . It must be all conjecture . ”
93759	93866	93867	93867	He	1983	“ Conjecture — aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm . What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all;—your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word — Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing . There , it is done . I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . ”
93909	93916	93918	93918	he	1983	“ If you are very kind , ”
93920	93986	93987	93987	She	149	“ it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;—let me live them over again . You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds — all the worlds one ever has to give — for another half - hour . ”
93990	94016	94017	94017	She	149	“ What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _ has _ made one happy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth . ”
94052	94147	94034	94034	He	1983	“ Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here are a new set of Irish melodies . That , from such a quarter , one might expect . This was all sent with the instrument . Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . True affection only could have prompted it . ”
94251	94262	94231	94231	He	1983	“ You speak too plain . She must understand you . ”
94263	94287	94231	94231	He	1983	“ I hope she does . I would have her understand me . I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . ”
94288	94307	94231	94231	He	1983	“ But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea . ”
94308	94353	94231	94231	He	1983	“ I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . Leave shame to her . If she does wrong , she ought to feel it . ”
94354	94365	94231	94231	He	1983	“ She is not entirely without it , I think . ”
94366	94391	94231	94231	He	1983	“ I do not see much sign of it . She is playing _ Robin _ _ Adair _ at this moment—_his _ favourite . ”
94413	94484	94485	94485	She	107	“ Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother ’s room you know . I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . Quite delightful to have you all meet so!—Our little room so honoured ! ”
94533	94585	94609	94609	he	94	“ How d ’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here . ”
94612	94658	94609	94609	he	94	“ How is your niece , Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold last night . How is she to - day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . ”
94705	94719	94721	94722	Miss Bates	107	“ So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage , ”
94730	94745	94724	94724	He	94	“ I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ? ”
94746	94768	94724	94724	He	94	“ Oh ! dear , Kingston — are you?—Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . ”
94769	94787	94724	94724	He	94	“ Mrs. Cole has servants to send . Can I do any thing for _ you _ ? ”
94788	94835	94724	94724	He	94	“ No , I thank you . But do come in . Who do you think is here?—Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in . ”
94836	94839	94841	94841	he	94	“ Well , ”
94848	94855	94841	94841	he	94	“ for five minutes , perhaps . ”
94856	94873	94724	94724	He	94	“ And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful ; so many friends ! ”
94874	94903	94724	94724	He	94	“ No , not now , I thank you . I could not stay two minutes . I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can . ”
94904	94921	94724	94724	He	94	“ Oh ! do come in . They will be so very happy to see you . ”
94922	94944	94724	94724	He	94	“ No , no ; your room is full enough . I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . ”
94945	94989	94724	94724	He	94	“ Well , I am so sorry!—Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . ”
94990	95097	94724	94724	He	94	“ Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England . Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it . ”
95098	95124	94724	94724	He	94	“ Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence — so shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples ! ”
95125	95132	94724	94724	He	94	“ What is the matter now ? ”
95133	95266	94724	94724	He	94	“ To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked ! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins mentioned it here . You should not have done it , indeed you should not . Ah ! he is off . He never can bear to be thanked . But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .... Well , ( returning to the room , ) I have not been able to succeed . Mr. Knightley can not stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing .... ”
95267	95270	95272	95272	Jane	149	“ Yes , ”
95274	95286	95272	95272	Jane	149	“ we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . ”
95287	95372	94724	94724	He	94	“ Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ‘ Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ’ said he ; so I just mentioned .... Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?—You seem but just come — so very obliging of you . ”
95811	95832	96016	96018	Mrs _ .	2013	“ You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five , ”
95840	95903	96016	96018	Mrs _ .	2013	“ And there will be the two Gilberts , young Cox , my father , and myself , besides Mr. Knightley . Yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure . You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room . ”
95914	95931	96016	96018	Mrs _ .	2013	“ But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think there will . ”
95935	95989	95990	95990	Somebody	3317	“ And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it . It will not do to _ invite _ five couple . It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment . ”
96114	96128	96151	96151	Emma	124	“ Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? ”
96197	96202	96204	96204	he	87	“ Oh ! no , ”
96206	96346	96204	96204	he	87	“ it would be the extreme of imprudence . I could not bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So would poor little Harriet . So you would all . Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . Pray do not let them talk of it . That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of the draught . I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! ”
96447	96453	96455	96455	he	104	“ We were too magnificent , ”
96457	96471	96455	96455	he	104	“ We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well . ”
96475	96499	96455	96455	he	104	“ It would be a crowd — a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? ”
96500	96504	96505	96505	he	104	“ Very true , ”
96509	96515	96505	96505	he	104	“ it was very bad . ”
96529	96542	96525	96525	he	104	“ I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . ”
96543	96548	96550	96550	she	124	“ No , no , ”
96552	96590	96550	96550	she	124	“ you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd — and a crowd in a little room ! ”
96591	96598	96599	96599	he	104	“ There is no denying it , ”
96602	96684	96599	96599	he	104	“ I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room — Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite!—Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father — and altogether — I do not know that — I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . ”
96821	96827	96828	96828	he	104	“ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ”
96833	96916	96828	96828	he	104	“ your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father ’s little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a thought of my father ’s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? ”
96917	96921	96793	96793	he	104	“ The Crown ! ”
96922	97060	96793	96793	he	104	“ Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange?—You consent — I hope you consent ? ”
97061	97123	97124	97124	She	2026	“ It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not . I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy — It seems the only improvement that could be . Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ? ”
97155	97254	96793	96793	he	104	“ No ; he thought it very far from an improvement — a very bad plan — much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life — did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh ! no — a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . ”
97255	97264	97266	97267	Frank Churchill	104	“ I was going to observe , sir , ”
97269	97318	97266	97267	Frank Churchill	104	“ that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ’s catching cold — so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . ”
97319	97322	97324	97325	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Sir , ”
97330	97382	97324	97325	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character . Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ’s house . ”
97383	97445	96793	96793	he	104	“ From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all — not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . ”
97446	97503	96793	96793	he	104	“ Open the windows!—but surely , Mr. Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent ! I never heard of such a thing . Dancing with open windows!—I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . ”
97504	97542	97324	97325	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Ah ! sir — but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself . ”
97543	97646	97324	97325	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Have you indeed , sir?—Bless me ! I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over — but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One can not resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . ”
97647	97660	96793	96793	he	104	“ But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited — ”
97661	97664	97666	97666	Emma	124	“ Oh ! ”
97668	97719	97666	97666	Emma	124	“ there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable . ”
97720	97786	96793	96793	he	104	“ So they will , my dear . That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired — but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight . ”
97787	97818	96793	96793	he	104	“ I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston ’s care . Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . ”
97819	97900	96793	96793	he	104	“ There , papa!—Now you must be satisfied — Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ‘ If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . ’ How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! ”
97901	98004	96793	96793	he	104	“ Aye , very true . Mr. Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ’s great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort — which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella ’s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . ”
98005	98019	98021	98022	Frank Churchill	104	“ My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , ”
98024	98100	98021	98022	Frank Churchill	104	“ examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . ”
98182	98185	98187	98187	she	124	“ Emma , ”
98189	98225	98187	98187	she	124	“ this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined . ”
98226	98235	98237	98238	her husband	438	“ My dear , you are too particular , ”
98240	98279	98237	98238	her husband	438	“ What does all that signify ? You will see nothing of it by candlelight . It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight . We never see any thing of it on our club - nights . ”
98289	98300	98302	98303	the gentlemen	1759	“ Men never know when things are dirty or not ; ”
98310	98321	98308	98308	himself	1759	“ Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . ”
98571	98593	98554	98554	She	90	“ I do not think it _ is _ so very small . We shall not be many , you know . ”
98615	98648	98595	98596	Mr. Weston	88	“ You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs . ”
98649	98653	98655	98656	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I wish , ”
98658	98695	98655	98656	Mrs. Weston	90	“ one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object — if one could but tell what that would be . ”
98696	98702	98704	98704	Frank	104	“ Yes , very true , ”
98706	98805	98704	98704	Frank	104	“ very true . You want your neighbours ’ opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them — the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ? She is still nearer.—And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ? ”
98806	98813	98815	98816	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Well — if you please , ”
98820	98831	98815	98816	Mrs. Weston	90	“ if you think she will be of any use . ”
98832	98844	98846	98846	Emma	124	“ You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , ”
98848	98882	98846	98846	Emma	124	“ She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . ”
98883	98916	98815	98816	Mrs. Weston	90	“ But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know . ”
98936	99015	98932	98932	his	88	“ Aye , do , Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both . Invite them both . ”
99016	99025	98917	98919	Here Mr. Weston	88	“ Both sir ! Can the old lady ? ”
99027	99061	98932	98932	his	88	“ The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . ”
99062	99092	98917	98919	Here Mr. Weston	88	“ Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both . ”
99382	99400	99375	99376	Mr. Weston	88	“ He has asked her , my dear . That ’s right . I knew he would ! ”
99666	99800	99656	99656	Emma	124	“ Very well . If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh ! yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins ’s week ’s account ; much rather , I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not I , indeed — I never look at it — I do not know who does.—Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . ”
99876	99916	99871	99871	she	124	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment it would be ! I do look forward to it , I own , with _ very _ great pleasure . ”
100166	100212	100162	100163	Mrs. Weston	90	“ that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . ”
100286	100293	100275	100276	been!—Every body	2076	happiest!—“I said it would be so , ”
100429	100442	100421	100421	himself	2081	“ Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst . ”
100443	100450	100452	100452	Emma	124	“ But you will come again , ”
100454	100465	100452	100452	Emma	124	“ This will not be your only visit to Randalls . ”
100466	100530	100421	100421	himself	2081	“ Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring — but I am afraid — they did not stir last spring — I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever . ”
100531	100541	100421	100421	himself	2081	“ Our poor ball must be quite given up . ”
100542	100585	100452	100452	Emma	124	“ Ah ! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ? ”
100586	100610	100421	100421	himself	2081	“ Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance . I would much rather have been merry than wise . ”
100611	100638	100639	100639	Emma	124	“ If I can come again , we are still to have our ball . My father depends on it . Do not forget your engagement . ”
100643	100652	100653	100653	he	2082	“ Such a fortnight as it has been ! ”
100656	100688	100653	100653	he	2082	“ every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making me less fit to bear any other place . Happy those , who can remain at Highbury ! ”
100689	100699	100701	100701	Emma	124	“ As you do us such ample justice now , ”
100705	100769	100770	100770	He	2082	“ I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? Do not we rather surpass your expectations ? I am sure we do . I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury . ”
100790	100800	100781	100781	Emma	124	“ And you must be off this very morning ? ”
100801	100836	100653	100653	he	2082	“ Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . ”
100837	100868	100770	100770	He	2082	“ Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ? How unlucky ! Miss Bates ’s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours . ”
100869	100964	100781	100781	Emma	124	“ Yes — I _ have _ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better . It was a right thing to do . I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ’s being absent . She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _ must _ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . It was better to pay my visit , then ”
100977	100981	100983	100983	he	2083	“ In short , ”
100985	101000	100983	100983	he	2083	“ perhaps , Miss Woodhouse — I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion ”
101057	101075	101053	101053	she	2084	“ You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then ”
101155	101181	101142	101142	he	2083	“ It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield . My regard for Hartfield is most warm ”
101284	101291	101293	101295	the young man	3246	“ It was time to go ; ”
101313	101321	101323	101323	he	2083	“ I shall hear about you all , ”
101325	101399	101323	101323	he	2083	“ that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you . I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it . Oh ! the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing . In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again . ”
101411	101416	101323	101323	he	2083	“ Good - bye , ”
101659	101664	101666	101666	she	124	“ I certainly must , ”
101668	101779	101666	101666	she	124	“ This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ’s being dull and insipid about the house ! — I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not — for a few weeks at least . Well ! evil to some is always good to others . I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will be happy . He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes . ”
101840	101868	101816	101816	he	94	“ You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! ”
102275	102291	102366	102366	she	2091	“ I do not find myself making any use of the word _ sacrifice _ , ”
102293	102361	102366	102366	she	2091	she.—“In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness . So much the better . I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do . I am quite enough in love . I should be sorry to be more . ”
102377	102620	102366	102366	she	2091	“ _ He _ is undoubtedly very much in love — every thing denotes it — very much in love indeed!—and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto . No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.—Still , however , I must be on my guard . This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man — I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.—His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable.—Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do very well again after a little while — and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily . ”
102888	102918	102929	102929	herself	124	words—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse ’s beautiful little friend . Pray make my excuses and adieus to her . ”
103085	103090	103084	103088	the “ beautiful little friend	4524	“ beautiful little friend , ”
103159	103167	103149	103149	Harriet	113	“ I must not dwell upon it , ”
103169	103230	103149	103149	Harriet	113	she.—“I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure . ”
103346	103352	103355	103356	every body	3172	“ Mr. Elton and his bride ”
103546	103579	103540	103540	Harriet	113	“ it was very true — it was just as Miss Woodhouse described — it was not worth while to think about them — and she would not think about them any longer ”
103615	103709	103608	103608	Emma	124	“ Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton ’s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ . You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.—Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you — and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . ”
103729	103902	103726	103726	Emma	124	“ I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important — and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due — or rather what would be kind by me . ”
103967	104009	104063	104063	herself	124	“ You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life — Want gratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for you!—Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! ”
104047	104058	104060	104060	she	124	“ There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , ”
104065	104221	104060	104060	she	124	“ There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved — which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not — but I know how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet!—I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a hundred such — And for a wife — a sensible man ’s wife — it is invaluable . I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! ”
104478	104486	104487	104487	She	124	“ elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . ”
104747	104753	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ”
104775	104799	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?—Is not she very charming ? ”
104810	104823	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ Oh ! yes — very — a very pleasing young woman . ”
104824	104833	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . ”
104834	104846	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . ”
104847	104862	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . ”
104863	104886	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ Oh ! no — there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . ”
104887	104892	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ I dare say , ”
104899	104911	104894	104894	Harriet	113	“ I dare say she was very much attached to him . ”
104912	104953	104755	104755	Harriet	113	“ Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ’s fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . ”
104954	104957	104959	104959	Harriet	113	“ Yes , ”
104962	105087	104959	104959	Harriet	113	“ and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again . He is just as superior as ever;—but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ‘ Augusta . ’ How delightful ! ”
105334	105340	105389	105389	she	201	“ My brother Mr. Suckling ’s seat;”—a
105395	105429	105370	105371	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the likeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ’s favourite room . ”—Mr
105434	105448	105431	105431	Elton	201	to.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . ”
105449	105610	105611	105611	Emma	124	“ And the staircase — You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) . A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . ”
105638	105751	105627	105628	Mrs. Elton	201	“ So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is not merely the house — the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way — just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . ”
105806	105833	106715	106716	Mrs. Elton	201	“ When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties . ”
105834	105863	106715	106716	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that . It is the garden of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England . ”
105864	105896	105906	105907	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry . ”
105897	105904	105906	105907	Mrs. Elton	201	“ No , I fancy not , ”
105915	105926	105906	105907	Mrs. Elton	201	“ I never heard any county but Surry called so . ”
105931	105950	105952	105953	Mrs. Elton	201	“ My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , ”
105955	106150	105952	105953	Mrs. Elton	201	“ and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _ our _ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King’s - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ? ”
106151	106205	105906	105907	Mrs. Elton	201	“ No ; not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . ”
106206	106442	105952	105953	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ‘ I really can not get this girl to move from the house . I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . ’ Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father ’s state of health must be a great drawback . Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he should . Let me recommend Bath to you . I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . ”
106443	106492	105952	105953	Mrs. Elton	201	“ My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . ”
106493	106694	105906	105907	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Ah ! that ’s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse ’s spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . ”
106795	106825	106791	106792	Mrs. Elton	201	“ but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . ”
106841	106878	106791	106792	Mrs. Elton	201	“ I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady ’s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . ”
106879	107295	106791	106792	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea . A superior performer!—very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music — passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely can not do without music . It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too — knowing what I had been accustomed to — of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ I could give up — parties , balls , plays — for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _ me _ . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ‘ But , ’ said I , ‘ to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . ’ ”
107296	107302	107304	107304	Emma	124	“ We can not suppose , ”
107308	107353	107304	107304	Emma	124	“ that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive . ”
107354	107495	106791	106792	Mrs. Elton	201	“ No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head . I am delighted to find myself in such a circle . I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ? If _ we _ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies . Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know — there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music . ”
107496	107516	107304	107304	Emma	124	“ But you , who are so extremely fond of it — there can be no danger , surely ? ”
107517	107647	106791	106792	Mrs. Elton	201	“ I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music — never touches the instrument — though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys — Clara Partridge , that was — and of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate . Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . ”
107648	107656	107658	107658	Emma	124	“ But every thing of that kind , ”
107660	107670	107658	107658	Emma	124	“ will soon be in so regular a train — ”
107671	107674	107676	107677	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Well , ”
107681	107686	107676	107677	Mrs. Elton	201	“ we shall see . ”
107718	107726	107728	107728	she	201	“ We have been calling at Randalls , ”
107730	107809	107728	107728	she	201	“ and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . I like them extremely . Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature — quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you . And _ she _ appears so truly good — there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . She was your governess , I think ? ”
107832	107859	107820	107821	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman . ”
107860	107866	107868	107868	Emma	124	“ Mrs. Weston ’s manners , ”
107870	107895	107868	107868	Emma	124	“ were always particularly good . Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . ”
107896	107909	107910	107910	Emma	124	“ And who do you think came in while we were there ? ”
107931	107934	107936	107937	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Knightley ! ”
107939	108048	107936	107937	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Knightley himself!—Was not it lucky?—for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. ’s , I had a great curiosity . ‘ My friend Knightley ’ had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much . Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man . ”
108068	108072	108074	108074	her	124	“ Insufferable woman ! ”
108078	108305	108074	108074	her	124	“ Worse than I had supposed . Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley!—I could not have believed it . Knightley!—never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her _ caro _ _ sposo _ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs. Weston!—Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse . I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ? How angry and how diverted he would be ! Ah ! there I am — thinking of him directly . Always the first person to be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind ! ”
108349	108355	108356	108356	he	422	“ Well , my dear , ”
108360	108549	108356	108356	he	422	“ considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you . She speaks a little too quick . A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor . However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . Though I think he had better not have married . I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _ should _ in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before . Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . Ah ! it shews what a sad invalid I am ! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane . ”
108550	108566	108320	108320	her	2149	“ I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . Mr. Elton knows you . ”
108567	108596	108356	108356	he	422	“ Yes : but a young lady — a bride — I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . It was being very deficient . ”
108597	108654	108356	108356	he	422	“ But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _ bride _ ? It ought to be no recommendation to _ you _ . It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them . ”
108655	108728	108320	108320	her	2149	“ No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady — and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected . More is avowedly due to _ her _ . A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . ”
108729	108771	108356	108356	he	422	“ Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is . And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies . ”
108772	108808	108809	108809	Emma	124	“ My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . ”
109109	109117	109107	109107	her	86	“ very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . ”
109437	109612	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.—A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike — and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth — but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward . Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ‘ Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ‘ And waste its fragrance on the desert air . ’ We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax . ”
109613	109625	109627	109627	Emma	263	“ I can not think there is any danger of it , ”
109630	109669	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	answer—“and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ’s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . ”
109670	109810	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Oh ! but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end ! And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me . I am a great advocate for timidity — and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . ”
109811	109854	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	“ You appear to feel a great deal — but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax ’s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than ”
109856	110231	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	“ My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . You and I need not be afraid . If _ we _ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _ We _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it . I have no idea of that sort of thing . It is not likely that I _ should _ , considering what I have been used to . My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be — for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.—However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.—I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties . ”
110232	110235	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought
110236	110310	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	Emma.—“You have not deserved this . You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax . ’ Heavens ! Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!—But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ’s tongue ! ”
110334	110339	109426	109427	Mrs. Elton	201	“ dear Miss Woodhouse . ”
110541	110551	110606	110606	Jane	149	“ She is a riddle , quite a riddle ! ”
110553	110605	110606	110606	Jane	149	she.—“To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton ’s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection . ”
110702	110719	110721	110721	Emma	124	“ She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , ”
110725	110789	110721	110721	Emma	124	“ She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.—She is _ not _ to be with the _ Dixons _ . The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle . ”
110822	110889	110814	110815	Mrs. Weston	90	“ We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma — but it is better than being always at home . Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . ”
110890	110898	110900	110901	Mr. Knightley	94	“ You are right , Mrs. Weston , ”
110904	110961	110900	110901	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . ”
110992	111026	110988	110988	she	124	“ Such attentions as Mrs. Elton ’s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton ’s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . ”
111027	111033	111035	111036	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I should not wonder , ”
111038	111107	111035	111036	Mrs. Weston	90	“ if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ’s eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton ’s civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . ”
111128	111317	111125	111125	he	2179	“ Another thing must be taken into consideration too — Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other — a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton ’s way before — and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . ”
111318	111329	111331	111331	Emma	124	“ I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , ”
111355	111358	111359	111359	he	125	“ Yes , ”
111362	111374	111359	111359	he	125	“ any body may know how highly I think of her . ”
111375	111379	111381	111381	Emma	124	“ And yet , ”
111410	111441	111408	111408	she	124	on—“And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . ”
111483	111506	111507	111507	He	94	“ Oh ! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand . Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . ”
111533	111575	111529	111529	he	94	“ That will never be , however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her — and I am very sure I shall never ask her . ”
111592	111608	111609	111609	He	94	“ You are not vain , Mr. Knightley . I will say that for you . ”
111634	111647	111616	111616	he	94	“ So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? ”
111648	111747	111748	111749	Mr. Knightley	94	“ No indeed I have not . You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . ”
111761	111797	111757	111757	his	94	“ No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . ”
111802	111841	111757	111757	his	94	“ Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman — but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . ”
111855	111858	111860	111860	she	124	“ Well , ”
111862	111873	111860	111860	she	124	“ and you soon silenced Mr. Cole , I suppose ? ”
111874	111916	111757	111757	his	94	“ Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . ”
111917	112143	111860	111860	she	124	“ In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles — what she calls them ! How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? She calls you , Knightley — what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax ’s mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton ’s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau . ”
112144	112150	112152	112153	Mr. Knightley—“I	271	“ Jane Fairfax has feeling , ”
112153	112254	111860	111860	she	124	Knightley—“I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong — and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - control ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be — And I love an open temper . No — till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always — but with no thought beyond . ”
112255	112261	112263	112263	Emma	124	“ Well , Mrs. Weston , ”
112270	112284	112263	112263	Emma	124	“ what do you say now to Mr. Knightley ’s marrying Jane Fairfax ? ”
112285	112337	111860	111860	she	124	“ Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me . ”
112401	112408	112410	112410	she	124	“ I see how it is , ”
112412	112486	112410	112410	she	124	“ I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . ”
112831	112881	112816	112816	Emma	124	“ She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . ”
113001	113007	113009	113009	she	124	“ This is very true , ”
113011	113075	113009	113009	she	124	“ at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant — and it is very shameful.—Of the same age — and always knowing her — I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never like me now . I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . ”
113538	113574	113535	113535	he	94	“ I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time . I hope you turned directly . ”
113575	113585	113587	113587	she	149	“ I went only to the post - office , ”
113589	113636	113587	113587	she	149	“ and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . A walk before breakfast does me good . ”
113637	113649	113535	113535	he	94	“ Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . ”
113650	113664	113587	113587	she	149	“ No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . ”
113673	113758	113665	113667	Mr. John Knightley	94	“ That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . ”
113770	113808	113535	113535	he	94	“ I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . ”
113809	113839	113535	113535	he	94	“ Indifferent ! Oh ! no — I never conceived you could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . ”
113840	113855	113535	113535	he	94	“ You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . ”
113856	113868	113870	113870	he	2215	“ I have often thought them the worst of the two , ”
113873	113889	113870	113870	he	2215	“ Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does . ”
113890	114019	113535	113535	he	94	“ Ah ! you are not serious now . I know Mr. John Knightley too well — I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . ”
114020	114037	114039	114040	John Knightley	94	“ When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , ”
114042	114122	114039	114040	John Knightley	94	“ I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other . Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle — but that is not the change I had in view for you . As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . ”
114137	114140	113535	113535	he	94	“ thank you ”
114221	114274	114215	114215	his	87	“ I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies are delicate plants . They should take care of their health and their complexion . My dear , did you change your stockings ? ”
114275	114297	114215	114215	his	87	“ Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . ”
114298	114384	114215	114215	his	87	“ My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . ”
114437	114485	114486	114486	Jane	149	“ My dear Jane , what is this I hear?—Going to the post - office in the rain!—This must not be , I assure you.—You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you . ”
114499	114552	114486	114486	Jane	149	“ Oh ! do not tell _ me _ . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.—To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority . ”
114553	114557	114559	114560	Mrs. Weston	90	“ My advice , ”
114565	114677	114559	114560	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I certainly do feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.—Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again . ”
114678	114694	114697	114698	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Oh ! she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again , ”
114700	114711	114697	114698	Mrs. Elton	201	“ We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”—and
114713	114792	114486	114486	Jane	149	significantly—“there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _ us _ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . ”
114793	114799	114801	114801	Jane	149	“ You are extremely kind , ”
114803	114857	114801	114801	Jane	149	“ but I can not give up my early walk . I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . ”
114858	114950	114486	114486	Jane	149	“ My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . ”
114951	114955	114957	114957	Jane	149	“ Excuse me , ”
114960	115010	114957	114957	Jane	149	“ I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ’s . ”
115011	115034	115035	115035	Jane	149	“ Oh ! my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to employ our men . ”
115061	115071	115052	115052	she	149	“ The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! ”
115073	115104	115052	115052	she	149	she.—“The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! ”
115105	115113	115052	115052	she	149	“ It is certainly very well regulated . ”
115114	115185	115052	115052	she	149	“ So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong — and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder . ”
115186	115215	115217	115217	he	94	“ The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . If you want any farther explanation , ”
115221	115248	115217	115217	he	94	“ they are paid for it . That is the key to a great deal of capacity . The public pays and must be served well . ”
115264	115271	115273	115274	John Knightley	94	“ I have heard it asserted , ”
115276	115361	115273	115274	John Knightley	94	“ that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike . I have not always known their writing apart . ”
115362	115365	115367	115368	his brother	3486	“ Yes , ”
115371	115391	115367	115368	his brother	3486	“ there is a likeness . I know what you mean — but Emma ’s hand is the strongest . ”
115392	115400	115402	115403	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , ”
115405	115415	115402	115403	Mr. Woodhouse	87	“ and always did . And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with
115426	115433	115367	115368	his brother	3486	“ I never saw any gentleman ’s handwriting”—Emma
115466	115539	115461	115461	her	90	“ Now , how am I going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend — your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.—No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.—Now for it . ”
115547	115563	115545	115545	Emma	124	again—“Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ’s hands I ever saw . ”
115564	115571	115573	115574	Mr. Knightley	94	“ I do not admire it , ”
115576	115593	115573	115574	Mr. Knightley	94	“ It is too small — wants strength . It is like a woman ’s writing . ”
115611	115646	115603	115603	They	2226	“ No , it by no means wanted strength — it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong . Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce ? ”
115668	115677	115679	115679	Emma	124	“ If we were in the other room , ”
115681	115721	115679	115679	Emma	124	“ if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . I have a note of his.—Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? ”
115722	115730	115603	115603	They	2226	“ He chose to say he was employed ”
115732	115753	115603	115603	They	2226	“ Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . ”
115754	115768	115770	115771	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Oh ! when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , ”
115774	115795	115770	115771	Mr. Knightley	94	“ writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best . ”
115838	115854	115821	115821	his	87	“ Must I go first ? I really am ashamed of always leading the way . ”
116203	116209	116211	116211	she	149	“ Here is April come ! ”
116213	116227	116211	116211	she	149	“ I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here . ”
116228	116250	116166	116166	them	3341	“ But I have never fixed on June or any other month — merely looked forward to the summer in general . ”
116251	116260	116211	116211	she	149	“ But have you really heard of nothing ? ”
116261	116279	116211	116211	she	149	“ I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet . ”
116280	116307	116166	116166	them	3341	“ Oh ! my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . ”
116308	116313	116315	116315	Jane	149	“ I not aware ! ”
116321	116337	116315	116315	Jane	149	“ dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ? ”
116338	116452	116166	116166	them	3341	“ But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations . I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove . A cousin of Mr. Suckling , Mrs. Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . Wax - candles in the schoolroom ! You may imagine how desirable ! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge ’s is the one I would most wish to see you in . ”
116453	116467	116469	116469	Jane	149	“ Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , ”
116471	116514	116469	116469	Jane	149	“ I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself . But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . ”
116515	116586	116166	116166	them	3341	“ Trouble ! aye , I know your scruples . You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . ”
116587	116621	116166	116166	them	3341	“ Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . ”
116622	116704	116469	116469	Jane	149	“ But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ’s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . ”
116705	116790	116166	116166	them	3341	“ Excuse me , ma’am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something — Offices for the sale — not quite of human flesh — but of human intellect . ”
116791	116830	116166	116166	them	3341	“ Oh ! my dear , human flesh ! You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . ”
116831	116847	116849	116849	Jane	149	“ I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , ”
116851	116933	116849	116849	Jane	149	“ governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . ”
116934	116940	116942	116943	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Something that would do ! ”
116945	117010	116942	116943	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . ”
117011	117072	116166	116166	them	3341	“ You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman ’s family is all that I should condition for . ”
117073	117228	116942	116943	Mrs. Elton	201	“ I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;—that is — I do not know — if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;—yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;—and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest . ”
117229	117249	117251	117251	Jane	149	“ You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , ”
117253	117335	117251	117251	Jane	149	“ they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am . ”
117336	117348	117350	117351	Mrs. Elton	201	“ And I am quite serious too , I assure you , ”
117354	117380	117350	117351	Mrs. Elton	201	“ in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . ”
117425	117686	117414	117414	her	201	“ Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!—Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he is;—I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . Oh ! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it?—Selina ’s choice — handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed — quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ? ”
117974	117987	117968	117968	his	94	“ I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . ”
118139	118146	118148	118148	he	88	“ Read it , read it , ”
118150	118173	118148	118148	he	88	“ it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines — will not take you long ; read it to Emma . ”
118208	118428	118183	118183	he	88	“ Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it?—I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?—Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?—In town next week , you see — at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . ”
118666	118682	118684	118685	Mr. Weston	88	“ I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , ”
118708	118721	118722	118722	he	88	“ You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , ”
118723	118739	118684	118685	Mr. Weston	88	continued—“and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . ”
118740	118783	118722	118722	he	88	“ Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . ”
118784	118877	118722	118722	he	88	“ You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure . — He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ’s hand , presumed to open it — though it was not directed to me — it was to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter . ”
118878	118948	118684	118685	Mr. Weston	88	“ And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston—(laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.—A most dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! ”
118949	119036	118684	118685	Mr. Weston	88	“ Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.—This letter tells us — it is a short letter — written in a hurry , merely to give us notice — it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill ’s account — she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her — so they are all to move southward without loss of time . ”
119037	119049	118722	118722	he	88	“ Indeed!—from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? ”
119050	119068	118684	118685	Mr. Weston	88	“ Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London , a considerable journey . ”
119069	119145	118684	118685	Mr. Weston	88	“ Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me — but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses . ”
119146	119155	119157	119158	Mr. Weston	88	“ The evil of the distance from Enscombe , ”
119160	119276	119157	119158	Mr. Weston	88	“ is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank ’s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ’s ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness — but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . You must grant me that . ”
119277	119399	119503	119503	she	201	“ No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice — You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women — and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill ’s making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says it is quite horror to her — and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? ”
119400	119431	119433	119434	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for ”
119439	119469	119433	119434	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Oh ! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me . Selina is no fine lady , I assure you . Do not run away with such an idea . ”
119470	119497	119498	119499	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Is not she ? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . ”
119562	119651	119557	119558	Mr. Weston	88	“ Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect — but this is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _ that _ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . I would not say so to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill ’s illness . ”
119652	119673	119545	119545	she	201	“ If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr. Weston?—To Bath , or to Clifton ? ”
119674	119741	119545	119545	she	201	“ She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her . The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . It is a retired place . A fine place , but very retired . ”
119742	119853	119557	119558	Mr. Weston	88	“ Aye — like Maple Grove , I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from every thing — in the most complete retirement.—And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . I always say a woman can not have too many resources — and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . ”
119854	119864	119545	119545	she	201	“ Frank was here in February for a fortnight . ”
119865	119920	119545	119545	she	201	“ So I remember to have heard . He will find an _ addition _ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world . ”
119948	119984	119985	119985	He	88	“ My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston ’s letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton . ”
119997	120003	120005	120005	he	88	“ When Frank left us , ”
120007	120154	120005	120005	he	88	“ it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ’s news doubly welcome . It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up — but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ‘ How could he contrive to come ? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ’ and so forth — I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . I have observed , Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . ”
120155	120283	120284	120284	She	2265	“ Very true , Mr. Weston , perfectly true . It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _ May _ before Hymen ’s saffron robe would be put on for us . Oh ! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! The carriage — we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair . ”
120305	120595	120295	120296	Mr. Weston	88	“ You were mentioning May . May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe — in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring — precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time . This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . I think it is so . I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . Mrs. Weston ’s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . She thinks nobody equal to him . ”
120596	120683	120684	120685	Mr. Weston	88	“ And I assure you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer . ”
120689	120693	120695	120695	he	88	“ I hope , ”
120698	120926	120695	120695	he	88	“ I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill . If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish . You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . She was the instigator . Frank ’s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ’s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart . ”
120927	121201	121202	121202	They	2266	“ Only think ! well , that must be infinitely provoking ! I have quite a horror of upstarts . Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves ! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly . People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families . A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr. Weston . One has not great hopes from Birmingham . I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr. Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . It is infinitely too bad . Mr. Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him — I believe , at least — I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death . ”
121334	121417	121329	121329	he	94	“ Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ’s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her ’s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . ”
121418	121427	121429	121429	Emma	124	“ I rather hope to satisfy you both , ”
121431	121461	121429	121429	Emma	124	“ for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . ”
121462	121477	121329	121329	he	94	“ And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again . ”
121478	121492	121329	121329	he	94	“ That is very likely . You think so , do not you ? ”
121493	121533	121429	121429	Emma	124	“ I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father — or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . ”
121534	121537	121329	121329	he	94	“ Increase ! ”
121538	121562	121329	121329	he	94	“ Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life . ”
121563	121572	121429	121429	Emma	124	“ Difference ! No indeed I am not . ”
121573	121686	121329	121329	he	94	“ There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!—When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr. Cole ’s , or balls at the Crown . The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great . ”
121687	121690	121692	121693	his brother	3486	“ Yes , ”
121696	121705	121692	121693	his brother	3486	“ it is Randalls that does it all . ”
121706	121762	121329	121329	he	94	“ Very well — and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way . And if they are , I only beg you to send them home . ”
121763	121766	121768	121769	Mr. Knightley	94	“ No , ”
121771	121793	121768	121769	Mr. Knightley	94	“ that need not be the consequence . Let them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be at leisure . ”
121794	121799	121801	121801	Emma	124	“ Upon my word , ”
121803	122017	121801	121801	Emma	124	“ you amuse me ! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing engagements of mine — what have they been ? Dining once with the Coles — and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I can not imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one — and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . ”
122577	122641	122642	122642	She	124	“ He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed — he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word — but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . ”
123733	123738	123739	123739	she	124	“ So unreasonably early ! ”
124092	124101	124103	124103	he	104	“ I think she must be here soon , ”
124105	124137	124103	124103	he	104	“ I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her . It can not be long , I think , before she comes . ”
124156	124187	124188	124188	Mr.	2316	“ I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her . I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton . I have no business to put myself forward . ”
124203	124211	124213	124214	Mr. Weston	88	“ But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! ”
124219	124228	124213	124214	Mr. Weston	88	“ We thought you were to bring them . ”
124308	124318	124320	124320	Frank	104	rain.—“I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , ”
124325	124333	124320	124320	Frank	104	“ Miss Bates must not be forgotten : ”
124387	124527	124364	124364	she	201	“ A very fine young man indeed , Mr. Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.—You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve — so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies — quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . ”
124579	124655	124572	124573	Mrs. Elton	201	“ I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a pleasure it is to send one ’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of _ them _ . ”
124761	124892	124757	124757	she	201	“ So very obliging of you!—No rain at all . Nothing to signify . I do not care for myself . Quite thick shoes . And Jane declares — Well!—(as soon as she was within the door ) Well ! This is brilliant indeed!—This is admirable!—Excellently contrived , upon my word . Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane , Jane , look!—did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ’s lamp . Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ‘ Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ’ said I — but I had not time for more . ”
124899	125503	124898	124899	Mrs. Weston.—“Very	291	Weston.—“Very well , I thank you , ma’am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache!—seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs. Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage!—excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment . Most comfortable carriage.—Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score . Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.—But two such offers in one day!—Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ‘ Upon my word , ma’am—. ’ Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr. Woodhouse ’s . I made her take her shawl — for the evenings are not warm — her large new shawl — Mrs. Dixon ’s wedding - present.—So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know — Mr. Dixon ’s choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely — and there was a mat to step upon — I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh ! Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother ’s spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?—Ah ! here ’s Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?—Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land!—Such a transformation!—Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)—that would be rude — but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look — how do you like Jane ’s hair?—You are a judge.—She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah ! Dr. Hughes I declare — and Mrs. Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.—How do you do ? How do you do?—Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it?—Where ’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh ! there he is . Do n’t disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the town — Mrs. Otway , I protest!—and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do you do ? How do you all do?—Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the worthy Coles.—Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me — never take coffee.—A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,—no hurry — Oh ! here it comes . Every thing so good ! ”
125592	125608	125578	125579	Mrs. Elton	201	“ How do you like my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my hair?”—with
125625	125729	125620	125621	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do — but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ’s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons — who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour — I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.—We shall see if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill . I like him very well . ”
125794	125830	125782	125782	Elton	201	“ Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?—I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . ”
125831	125832	125833	125834	Frank Churchill	104	“ Jane!”—repeated
125842	125857	125833	125834	Frank Churchill	104	displeasure.—“That is easy — but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . ”
125858	125866	125868	125868	Emma	124	“ How do you like Mrs. Elton ? ”
125873	125878	125868	125868	Emma	124	“ Not at all . ”
125879	125884	125929	125929	him	104	“ You are ungrateful . ”
125885	125891	125929	125929	him	104	“ Ungrateful!—What do you mean ? ”
125899	125924	125929	125929	him	104	smile—“No , do not tell me — I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is my father?—When are we to begin dancing ? ”
126017	126031	126033	126034	Mr. Weston	88	“ And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? ”
126036	126046	126033	126034	Mr. Weston	88	“ She will think Frank ought to ask her . ”
126920	126929	126912	126912	her	90	“ Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? ”
126937	126951	126912	126912	her	90	“ Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me . ”
126952	126972	126907	126909	gentle Mrs. Weston	90	“ Me!—oh ! no — I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer . ”
126973	126981	126983	126983	he	97	“ If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , ”
126985	127038	126983	126983	he	97	“ I shall have great pleasure , I am sure — for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert . ”
127039	127068	126907	126909	gentle Mrs. Weston	90	“ Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing — Miss Smith . ”
127069	127124	127125	127126	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging — and if I were not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command — but my dancing days are over . ”
127427	127444	127424	127424	her	124	“ Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good - natured , I declare . ”
127478	128120	127454	127455	Miss Bates	107	“ Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?—Here is your tippet . Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet . She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done — One door nailed up — Quantities of matting — My dear Jane , indeed you must . Mr. Churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! How well you put it on!—so gratified ! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.—I set off without saying a word , just as I told you . Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ‘ Oh ! ’ said I , ‘ I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr. William Cox . ’ My dear sir , you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not rather?—I am not helpless . Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other!—Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs. Elton is going ; dear Mrs. Elton , how elegant she looks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening!—Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one . Well , I was persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style — Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus — so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!—Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing!—Such elegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since — Well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where _ I _ sit is of no consequence . Oh ! do you recommend this side?—Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill — only it seems too good — but just as you please . What you direct in this house can not be wrong . Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? Soup too ! Bless me ! I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I can not help beginning . ”
128189	128198	128200	128200	he	94	“ They aimed at wounding more than Harriet , ”
128202	128214	128215	128215	He	94	“ Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? ”
128230	128273	128215	128215	He	94	“ _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.—To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet . ”
128274	128278	128280	128280	Emma	124	“ I did , ”
128282	128290	128291	128291	He	94	“ and they can not forgive me . ”
128311	128326	128307	128307	he	94	“ I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections . ”
128327	128345	128215	128215	He	94	“ Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ? ”
128346	128371	128215	128215	He	94	“ Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . ”
128372	128424	128215	128215	He	94	“ I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It was through a series of strange blunders ! ”
128425	128512	128513	128513	Emma	124	“ And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without . An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl — infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton . I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . ”
128534	128568	128523	128524	Mr. Weston	88	“ Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?—Come Emma , set your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep ! ”
128569	128574	128576	128576	Emma	124	“ I am ready , ”
128578	128584	128576	128576	Emma	124	“ whenever I am wanted . ”
128585	128594	128596	128597	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Whom are you going to dance with ? ”
128608	128618	128599	128599	She	124	“ With you , if you will ask me . ”
128619	128623	128625	128625	he	94	“ Will you ? ”
128631	128664	128625	128625	he	94	“ Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . ”
128665	128674	128599	128599	She	124	“ Brother and sister ! no , indeed . ”
130626	130665	130602	130602	Harriet	113	“ Miss Woodhouse — if you are at leisure — I have something that I should like to tell you — a sort of confession to make — and then , you know , it will be over . ”
130704	130719	130720	130720	she	113	“ It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , ”
130723	130797	130720	130720	she	113	“ to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary — I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . ”
130798	130801	130803	130803	Emma	124	“ Yes , ”
130805	130811	130803	130803	Emma	124	“ I hope I do . ”
130812	130825	130827	130827	Harriet	113	“ How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! ... ”
130831	131055	131057	131057	she	2437	“ It seems like madness ! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not — except that of the two I had rather not see him — and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him — but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable — I shall never forget her look the other night!—However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil.—No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ’s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy — what I ought to have destroyed long ago — what I ought never to have kept — I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke).—However , now I will destroy it all — and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Can not you guess what this parcel holds ? ”
131064	131078	131057	131057	she	2437	“ Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing ? ”
131079	131100	131101	131101	She	2437	“ No — I can not call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much . ”
131188	131191	131193	131193	Harriet	113	“ Now , ”
131195	131202	131193	131193	Harriet	113	“ you _ must _ recollect . ”
131203	131211	131159	131159	Harriet	113	“ No , indeed I do not . ”
131212	131398	131193	131193	Harriet	113	“ Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat — just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came — I think the very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?—But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it — so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . ”
131399	131404	131406	131406	Emma	124	“ My dearest Harriet ! ”
131419	131519	131406	131406	Emma	124	“ you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic — I knew nothing of that till this moment — but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!—Oh ! my sins , my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on — what else ? ”
131520	131544	131406	131406	Emma	124	“ And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . ”
131545	131562	131564	131564	Emma	124	“ And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! ”
131587	131624	131582	131582	she	124	“ Lord bless me ! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this . ”
131625	131628	131630	131630	Harriet	113	“ Here , ”
131638	131677	131630	131630	Harriet	113	“ here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . ”
131701	131707	131582	131582	she	124	“ This was really his , ”
131709	131864	131582	131582	she	124	Harriet.—“Do not you remember one morning?—no , I dare say you do not . But one morning — I forget exactly the day — but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _ that _ _ evening _ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . ”
131865	131871	131873	131873	Emma	124	“ I do remember it , ”
131875	131936	131873	131873	Emma	124	“ I perfectly remember it.—Talking about spruce - beer.—Oh ! yes — Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton ’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it.—Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ? I have an idea he was standing just here . ”
131937	131974	131582	131582	she	124	“ Ah ! I do not know . I can not recollect.—It is very odd , but I can not recollect.—Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now . ”
131976	131982	131873	131873	Emma	124	“ Well , go on . ”
131983	132026	131582	131582	she	124	“ Oh ! that ’s all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say — except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . ”
132027	132045	131582	131582	she	124	“ My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? ”
132046	132109	131873	131873	Emma	124	“ Yes , simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was — but had not resolution enough to part with them . ”
132110	132146	131582	131582	she	124	“ But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?—I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful . ”
132147	132156	132158	132158	Harriet	113	“ I shall be happier to burn it , ”
132160	132192	132158	132158	Harriet	113	“ It has a disagreeable look to me . I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . ”
132193	132197	132199	132199	Emma	124	“ And when , ”
132201	132211	132199	132199	Emma	124	“ will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? ”
132299	132315	132287	132287	She	124	“ Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so”—and
132338	132344	132330	132330	Harriet	113	“ I shall never marry . ”
132376	132384	132330	132330	Harriet	113	“ Never marry!—This is a new resolution . ”
132385	132397	132450	132450	She	124	“ It is one that I shall never change , however . ”
132403	132423	132450	132450	She	124	“ I hope it does not proceed from — I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? ”
132424	132429	132431	132431	Harriet	113	“ Mr. Elton indeed ! ”
132432	132434	132431	132431	Harriet	113	indignantly.—“Oh ! no”—and
132442	132449	132431	132431	Harriet	113	“ so superior to Mr. Elton ! ”
132607	132663	133080	133080	Harriet	113	“ Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ? ”
132664	132732	133080	133080	Harriet	113	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose — Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance — and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially . ”
132733	132757	133080	133080	Harriet	113	“ I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet . The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . ”
132758	132816	133080	133080	Harriet	113	“ Service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time — when I saw him coming — his noble look — and my wretchedness before . Such a change ! In one moment such a change ! From perfect misery to perfect happiness ! ”
132817	133079	133080	133080	Harriet	113	“ It is very natural . It is natural , and it is honourable.—Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise . I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet . I do not by any means engage for its being returned . Consider what you are about . Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him . Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject . I am determined against all interference . Henceforward I know nothing of the matter . Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . But take care of yourself . I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _ him _ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value . ”
133546	133553	133541	133541	his	94	“ Myself creating what I saw , ”
133768	133773	133775	133776	Frank Churchill	104	“ By the bye , ”
133782	133796	133778	133779	Mrs. Weston	90	“ what became of Mr. Perry ’s plan of setting up his carriage ? ”
133805	133818	133797	133798	Mrs. Weston	90	“ I did not know that he ever had any such plan . ”
133819	133838	133778	133779	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago . ”
133839	133844	133778	133779	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Me ! impossible ! ”
133845	133912	133797	133798	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to _ her _ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . You must remember it now ? ”
133913	133926	133778	133779	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . ”
133927	133973	133778	133779	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Never ! really , never!—Bless me ! how could it be?—Then I must have dreamt it — but I was completely persuaded — Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . ”
133974	133981	133983	133984	Mr. Weston	88	“ What is this?—What is this ? ”
133986	134021	133983	133984	Mr. Weston	88	“ about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I am glad he can afford it . You had it from himself , had you ? ”
134022	134027	134029	134030	his son	3236	“ No , sir , ”
134034	134131	134029	134030	his son	3236	“ I seem to have had it from nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston ’s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars — but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . I am a great dreamer . I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away — and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry . ”
134132	134138	134140	134141	his father	3231	“ It is odd though , ”
134143	134266	134140	134141	his father	3231	“ that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe . Perry ’s setting up his carriage ! and his wife ’s persuading him to it , out of care for his health — just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature . What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream ! And at others , what a heap of absurdities it is ! Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ? ”
134299	134307	134309	134310	Miss Bates	107	“ Why , to own the truth , ”
134326	134679	134309	134310	Miss Bates	107	“ if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have — I do not mean to say that he did not dream it — I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world — but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves — but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n’t you remember grandmama ’s telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to — very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother — indeed I do not know who is not — and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she?—Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry ’s coming.—Extraordinary dream , indeed ! ”
134894	134898	134900	134901	Frank Churchill	104	“ Miss Woodhouse , ”
134918	134980	134900	134901	Frank Churchill	104	“ have your nephews taken away their alphabets — their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ? This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again . ”
135084	135089	135097	135097	he	104	“ poor little boys , ”
135459	135465	135456	135456	she	124	“ Nonsense ! for shame ! ”
135479	135488	135468	135469	Frank Churchill	104	“ I will give it to her — shall I?”—and
135500	135515	135492	135492	Emma	124	“ No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . ”
135662	135673	135652	135652	he	94	“ I did not know that proper names were allowed , ”
135717	135726	135728	135729	the latter	1970	“ Aye , very true , my dear , ”
135737	135788	135728	135729	the latter	1970	word—“I was just going to say the same thing . It is time for us to be going indeed . The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . My dear sir , you are too obliging . We really must wish you good night . ”
135972	135977	135979	135979	he	94	“ Pray , Emma , ”
135981	136035	135979	135979	he	94	“ may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . ”
136072	136075	136076	136076	she	124	“ Oh ! ”
136082	136094	136076	136076	she	124	“ it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . ”
136095	136099	136100	136100	he	94	“ The joke , ”
136104	136113	136100	136100	he	94	“ seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . ”
136220	136225	136227	136227	he	94	“ My dear Emma , ”
136235	136257	136227	136227	he	94	“ do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? ”
136258	136280	136548	136548	She	2486	“ Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh ! yes , perfectly.—Why do you make a doubt of it ? ”
136281	136303	136548	136548	She	2486	“ Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? ”
136304	136309	136310	136310	she	124	“ Never , never ! ”
136316	136344	136548	136548	She	2486	eagerness—“Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me . And how could it possibly come into your head ? ”
136345	136373	136548	136548	She	2486	“ I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them — certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public . ”
136374	136547	136548	136548	She	2486	“ Oh ! you amuse me excessively . I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander — but it will not do — very sorry to check you in your first essay — but indeed it will not do . There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances — feelings rather of a totally different nature — it is impossible exactly to explain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it — but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be . That is , I _ presume _ it to be so on her side , and I can _ answer _ for its being so on his . I will answer for the gentleman ’s indifference . ”
137241	137253	137255	137255	he	88	“ I am glad you approve of what I have done , ”
137259	137310	137255	137255	he	88	“ But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party . A large party secures its own amusement . And she is a good - natured woman after all . One could not leave her out . ”
137423	137432	137433	137433	she	201	“ Is not this most vexatious , Knightley ? ”
137434	137485	137412	137413	Mrs. Elton	201	cried.—“And such weather for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious . What are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston . ”
137486	137494	137496	137497	Mr. Knightley	94	“ You had better explore to Donwell , ”
137499	137519	137496	137497	Mr. Knightley	94	“ That may be done without horses . Come , and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast . ”
137546	137557	137536	137536	his	94	“ Oh ! I should like it of all things , ”
137646	137653	137655	137655	she	201	“ You may depend upon me , ”
137657	137681	137655	137655	she	201	“ I certainly will come . Name your day , and I will come . You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? ”
137682	137690	137692	137692	he	94	“ I can not name a day , ”
137694	137710	137655	137655	she	201	“ till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you . ”
137711	137746	137655	137655	she	201	“ Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give me a carte - blanche.—I am Lady Patroness , you know . It is my party . I will bring friends with me . ”
137747	137755	137757	137757	he	94	“ I hope you will bring Elton , ”
137759	137772	137757	137757	he	94	“ but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations . ”
137773	137836	137655	137655	she	201	“ Oh ! now you are looking very sly . But consider — you need not be afraid of delegating power to _ me _ . I am no young lady on her preferment . Married women , you know , may be safely authorised . It is my party . Leave it all to me . I will invite your guests . ”
137837	137838	137655	137655	she	201	“ No,”—he
137840	137868	137655	137655	she	201	replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is — ”
137869	137877	137879	137880	Mrs. Elton	201	“ — Mrs. Weston , I suppose , ”
137885	137903	137879	137880	Mrs. Elton	201	“ No — Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . ”
137904	137913	137914	137914	she	201	“ Ah ! you are an odd creature ! ”
137924	137983	137879	137880	Mrs. Elton	201	herself.—“You are a humourist , and may say what you like . Quite a humourist . Well , I shall bring Jane with me — Jane and her aunt.—The rest I leave to you . I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family . Do n’t scruple . I know you are attached to them . ”
137984	138007	137655	137655	she	201	“ You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . ”
138008	138158	137655	137655	she	201	“ That ’s quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:—but as you like . It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade — a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;—and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors — a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ? ”
138159	138230	137879	137880	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors . When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . ”
138231	138287	137655	137655	she	201	“ Well — as you please ; only do n’t have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything — ”
138288	138302	137655	137655	she	201	“ I have not the least wish for it , I thank you . ”
138303	138319	137879	137880	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Well — but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . ”
138320	138343	137655	137655	she	201	“ I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ’s assistance . ”
138344	138448	137655	137655	she	201	“ I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me — and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;—and very long walks , you know — in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . ”
138449	138508	137879	137880	Mrs. Elton	201	“ You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs. Cole ’s . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . ”
138509	138589	137655	137655	she	201	“ That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend . Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.—Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . ”
138705	138842	138695	138695	He	87	“ Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma ’s , and Harriet ’s going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them — very kind and sensible — much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining out . ”
139501	139661	139703	139703	she	90	of.—“The best fruit in England — every body ’s favourite — always wholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather for one ’s self — the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly the best time — never tired — every sort good — hautboy infinitely superior — no comparison — the others hardly eatable — hautboys very scarce — Chili preferred — white wood finest flavour of all — price of strawberries in London — abundance about Bristol — Maple Grove — cultivation — beds when to be renewed — gardeners thinking exactly different — no general rule — gardeners never to be put out of their way — delicious fruit — only too rich to be eaten much of — inferior to cherries — currants more refreshing — only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping — glaring sun — tired to death — could bear it no longer — must go and sit in the shade . ”
139946	139970	139926	139926	she	318	removal.—“Should not they walk ? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens — all the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent . ”—The
140415	140440	140444	140444	him	94	“ These are my own concerns . I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin . ”—She
140568	140588	140554	140554	He	3231	“ His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them . ”—Mrs
141002	141009	141011	141011	she	149	“ Will you be so kind , ”
141013	141124	141011	141011	she	149	“ when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent — but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any body . It would only be giving trouble and distress . Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ? ”
141125	141142	141237	141237	She	2570	“ Certainly , if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ? ”
141143	141162	141011	141011	she	149	“ Yes — what should hurt me?—I walk fast . I shall be at home in twenty minutes . ”
141163	141201	141011	141011	she	149	“ But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . Let my father ’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage . It can be round in five minutes . ”
141202	141236	141237	141237	She	2570	“ Thank you , thank you — but on no account.—I would rather walk.—And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!—I , who may so soon have to guard others ! ”
141249	141279	141244	141244	Emma	124	“ That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . I must order the carriage . The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already . ”
141280	141282	141011	141011	she	149	“ I am,”—she
141283	141355	141356	141356	Emma	124	answered—“I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue — quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . ”
141405	141416	141401	141401	her	124	“ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!”—seemed
141448	141459	141461	141461	Emma	124	“ Such a home , indeed ! such an aunt ! ”
141472	141496	141497	141497	Jane	149	“ I do pity you . And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . ”
141721	141733	141735	141735	Emma	124	“ You will soon be cooler , if you sit still , ”
141737	141798	141735	141735	Emma	124	“ As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared — but such a point had been made of my coming ! You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . I met _ one _ as I came — Madness in such weather!—absolute madness ! ”
141888	141908	141881	141881	she	124	“ No — he should not eat . He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter . ”
141946	141985	141933	141933	Emma	124	“ I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet ’s sweet easy temper will not mind it . ”
142085	142099	142101	142101	he	104	“ As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad , ”
142103	142151	142101	142101	he	104	“ I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places . You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at — or my tour to read — or my poem . I shall do something to expose myself . ”
142152	142183	142063	142063	them	2583	“ That may be — but not by sketches in Swisserland . You will never go to Swisserland . Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England . ”
142184	142286	142063	142063	them	2583	“ They may be induced to go too . A warm climate may be prescribed for her . I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . I assure you I have . I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . I ought to travel . I am tired of doing nothing . I want a change . I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy — I am sick of England — and would leave it to - morrow , if I could . ”
142287	142312	142101	142101	he	104	“ You are sick of prosperity and indulgence . Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? ”
142313	142359	142063	142063	them	2583	“ _ I _ sick of prosperity and indulgence ! You are quite mistaken . I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . I am thwarted in every thing material . I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . ”
142360	142418	142063	142063	them	2583	“ You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us . ”
142419	142439	142063	142063	them	2583	“ No — I shall not stir . I shall sit by you . You are my best cure . ”
142440	142485	142101	142101	he	104	“ We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;—you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ? ”
142486	142503	142063	142063	them	2583	“ No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening . ”
142504	142519	142063	142063	them	2583	“ But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning . ”
142520	142539	142101	142101	he	104	“ No — It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross . ”
142540	142547	142063	142063	them	2583	“ Then pray stay at Richmond . ”
142548	142573	142063	142063	them	2583	“ But if I do , I shall be crosser still . I can never bear to think of you all there without me . ”
142574	142599	142101	142101	he	104	“ These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . I shall press you no more . ”
142701	142718	142694	142694	his	104	“ Well;—if _ you _ wish me to stay and join the party , I will . ”
143234	143245	143246	143246	They	2585	“ Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively . ”
143351	143360	143362	143362	he	104	“ How much I am obliged to you , ”
143364	143401	143362	143362	he	104	“ for telling me to come to - day!—If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . I had quite determined to go away again . ”
143402	143452	143343	143343	She	124	“ Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . I was a kinder friend than you deserved . But you were humble . You begged hard to be commanded to come . ”
143453	143470	143362	143362	he	104	“ Do n’t say I was cross . I was fatigued . The heat overcame me . ”
143471	143479	143362	143362	he	104	“ It is hotter to - day . ”
143480	143494	143343	143343	She	124	“ Not to my feelings . I am perfectly comfortable to - day . ”
143495	143505	143362	143362	he	104	“ You are comfortable because you are under command . ”
143506	143510	143362	143362	he	104	“ Your command?—Yes . ”
143511	143581	143343	143343	She	124	“ Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command . You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again — and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . ”
143582	143625	143362	143362	he	104	“ It comes to the same thing . I can have no self - command without a motive . You order me , whether you speak or not . And you can be always with me . You are always with me . ”
143626	143654	143362	143362	he	104	“ Dating from three o’clock yesterday . My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before . ”
143655	143675	143343	143343	She	124	“ Three o’clock yesterday ! That is your date . I thought I had seen you first in February . ”
143676	143710	143362	143362	he	104	“ Your gallantry is really unanswerable . But ( lowering her voice)—nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . ”
143711	143721	143723	143723	he	2600	“ I say nothing of which I am ashamed , ”
143729	143772	143723	143723	he	2600	“ I saw you first in February . Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can . Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side , and Dorking on the other . I saw you first in February . ”
143775	143834	143835	143835	Some	324	whispering—“Our companions are excessively stupid . What shall we do to rouse them ? Any nonsense will serve . They _ shall _ talk . Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ? ”
143872	143890	143863	143864	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ? ”
143891	143896	143897	143897	Emma	124	“ Oh ! no , no”—cried
143904	143974	143863	143864	Mr. Knightley	94	could—“Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now . Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . ”
143975	143983	143985	143986	Mrs. Elton	201	“ It is a sort of thing , ”
143989	144032	143985	143986	Mrs. Elton	201	“ which _ I _ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the _ Chaperon _ of the party—_I _ never was in any circle — exploring parties — young ladies — married women — ”
144048	144093	144042	144042	he	438	“ Very true , my love , very true . Exactly so , indeed — quite unheard of — but some ladies say any thing . Better pass it off as a joke . Every body knows what is due to _ you _ . ”
144094	144100	144102	144102	Frank	104	“ It will not do , ”
144106	144238	144102	144102	Frank	104	“ they are most of them affronted . I will attack them with more address . Ladies and gentlemen — I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated — or two things moderately clever — or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . ”
144239	144245	144247	144248	Miss Bates	107	“ Oh ! very well , ”
144250	144320	144247	144248	Miss Bates	107	“ then I need not be uneasy . ‘ Three things very dull indeed . ’ That will just do for me , you know . I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , sha n’t I ? ( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body ’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall ? ”
144326	144355	144356	144357	Miss Bates	107	“ Ah ! ma’am , but there may be a difficulty . Pardon me — but you will be limited as to number — only three at once . ”
144399	144451	144392	144392	shewed	2602	“ Ah!—well — to be sure . Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue . I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend . ”
144452	144458	144460	144461	Mr. Weston	88	“ I like your plan , ”
144463	144486	144460	144461	Mr. Weston	88	“ Agreed , agreed . I will do my best . I am making a conundrum . How will a conundrum reckon ? ”
144487	144499	144501	144501	his	88	“ Low , I am afraid , sir , very low , ”
144502	144517	144460	144461	Mr. Weston	88	son;—“but we shall be indulgent — especially to any one who leads the way . ”
144518	144523	144525	144525	Emma	124	“ No , no , ”
144527	144558	144525	144525	Emma	124	“ it will not reckon low . A conundrum of Mr. Weston ’s shall clear him and his next neighbour . Come , sir , pray let me hear it . ”
144559	144568	144570	144571	Mr. Weston	88	“ I doubt its being very clever myself , ”
144573	144599	144570	144571	Mr. Weston	88	“ It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ? ”
144600	144614	144525	144525	Emma	124	“ What two letters!—express perfection ! I am sure I do not know . ”
144615	144647	144570	144571	Mr. Weston	88	“ Ah ! you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em - ma.—Do you understand ? ”
144709	144752	144704	144705	Mr. Knightley	94	“ This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon . ”
144753	144766	144768	144769	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Oh ! for myself , I protest I must be excused , ”
144771	144967	144768	144769	Mrs. Elton	201	“ _ I _ really can not attempt — I am not at all fond of the sort of thing . I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with . I knew who it came from . An abominable puppy!—You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) . These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . Miss Woodhouse must excuse me . I am not one of those who have witty things at every body ’s service . I do not pretend to be a wit . I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . Pass us , if you please , Mr. Churchill . Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself . We have nothing clever to say — not one of us . “
144978	144990	144992	144992	I	0	” added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; “
145026	145027	145030	145030	my	0	” “
145054	145069	145047	145047	Jane	107	” Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . “
145073	145085	145070	145071	Happy couple	2608	” said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing:—“How
145226	145245	145269	145269	You	0	” Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . “
145253	145268	145269	145269	You	0	”—She was stopped by a cough . Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . “
145273	145284	145269	145269	You	0	” said he , gravely . She recovered her voice . “
145381	145405	145435	145435	you	0	” He made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , “
145498	145499	145486	145486	I	0	” “
145506	145507	145504	145504	myself	0	” “
145516	145517	145504	145504	myself	0	” “
145533	145534	145526	145526	You	0	” “
145578	145647	145567	145567	I	0	” Emma was in no danger of forgetting . It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . Would not Harriet be the very creature described ? Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it . “
145652	145659	145650	145650	ma’am	4308	” said Jane to her aunt , “
145666	145667	145663	145664	Mrs. Elton	201	” “
145740	145951	145737	145737	I	0	” They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley . Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man ’s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _ her _ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again . While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr. Knightley by her side . He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , “
146035	146051	146028	146028	I	0	” Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . “
146083	146084	146077	146077	she	2632	” “
146162	146163	146128	146128	her	2632	” “
146166	146170	146128	146128	her	2632	” cried Emma , “
146203	146204	146205	146205	They	2635	” “
146209	146213	146214	146214	I	0	” said he , “
146475	147031	147034	147034	you	2641	” While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in . He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless . They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern . She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome — then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late . He had turned away , and the horses were in motion . She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind . She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed — almost beyond what she could conceal . Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life . She was most forcibly struck . The truth of this representation there was no denying . She felt it at her heart . How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates ! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not compose her . As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more . She never had been so depressed . Happily it was not necessary to speak . There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were . CHAPTER VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma ’s thoughts all the evening . How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell . They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . A whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it . _ There _ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart . She hoped no one could have said to her , “
147052	147244	147043	147043	I	0	” Miss Bates should never again — no , never ! If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . But it should be so no more . In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse . She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . She had no objection . She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not . “
147252	147394	147043	147043	I	0	” She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule . There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking . She heard Miss Bates ’s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , “
147422	147447	147414	147414	I	0	” Poor old Mrs. Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . “
147457	147461	147451	147451	Jane	107	” said she , “
147533	147558	147527	147527	she	754	” Emma seriously hoped she would . She had a moment ’s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her . But Miss Bates soon came—“Very
147561	147612	147615	147616	Miss Woodhouse	96	obliged”—but Emma ’s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before — less ease of look and manner . A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings . The touch seemed immediate . “
148154	148283	148142	148142	I	0	” Emma was most sincerely interested . Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude — sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax ’s advantage and comfort as possible . “
148308	148309	148294	148294	She	2665	” “
148314	148319	148294	148294	She	2665	” replied Miss Bates . “
148326	148333	148321	148321	you	2666	” There was no bearing such an “
148336	148352	148321	148321	you	2666	” and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of — “
148362	148363	148366	148367	Mrs. Smallridge	329	” “
148447	148448	148449	148450	Mrs. Elton	201	” “
148465	148466	148449	148450	Mrs. Elton	201	” “
148748	148749	148750	148750	You	0	” “
148758	148759	148755	148756	Mrs. Elton	201	” “
148818	148819	148827	148827	he	94	” “
148829	148830	148827	148827	he	94	” “
148969	148970	148971	148972	Miss Fairfax	149	” “
148995	148996	149000	149000	she	149	” “
149003	149004	149000	149000	she	149	” “
149048	149049	149035	149035	I	0	” “
149203	149204	149207	149207	madam	1420	” “
149209	149213	149207	149207	madam	1420	” cried Emma , “
149254	149255	149256	149256	You	96	” “
149264	149265	149256	149256	You	96	” “
149275	149276	149269	149270	Miss Fairfax	149	” “
149344	149345	149318	149318	I	0	” “
149376	149377	149385	149385	they	828	” “
149707	150018	149701	149701	Jane	149	” Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill ’s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence . What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler ’s own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill — which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady . There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma ’s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind . The contrast between Mrs. Churchill ’s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ’s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing — and she sat musing on the difference of woman ’s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ’s saying , “
150134	150264	150121	150121	she	107	” Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave . CHAPTER IX Emma ’s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her . Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father.—Mr . Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , “
150325	150326	150307	150307	you	2711	” “
150339	150340	150345	150345	I	0	” “
150355	150408	150345	150345	I	0	” Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going — her father began his inquiries . “
150474	151027	150466	150466	She	124	” Emma ’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr. Knightley.—It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from hers , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured . — He looked at her with a glow of regard . She was warmly gratified — and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.—He took her hand;—whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say — she might , perhaps , have rather offered it — but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips — when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.—Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive.—He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped.—The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . It spoke such perfect amity.—He left them immediately afterwards — gone in a moment . He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance . Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed — but it might have happened at a better time — and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.—They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found . It was a pity that she had not come back earlier ! In the hope of diverting her father ’s thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley ’s going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check,—interested , without disturbing him . He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ’s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr. Knightley ’s going to London had been an unexpected blow . “
151162	151402	151403	151405	Poor Mrs. Churchill	100	” The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background . An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill ! Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return . A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle . The great Mrs. Churchill was no more . It was felt as such things must be felt . Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried . Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame . Mrs. Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances . In one point she was fully justified . She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . “
151473	151487	151465	151466	Mr. Churchill	104	”—Even Mr. Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , “
151499	152014	151465	151466	Mr. Churchill	104	” and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma . The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband — her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion — and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill ’s death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ’s side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ’s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness — and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . “
152024	152390	152015	152016	Miss Fairfax	149	” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge ’s at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged — appetite quite gone — and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it otherwise — and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her — be it only an hour or two — from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name — mentioning that she had Mr. Perry ’s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note : “
152406	152600	152015	152016	Miss Fairfax	149	” Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates ’s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her — but it would not do;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service — and every thing that message could do was tried — but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.—Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . “
152662	152829	152855	152855	she	107	” Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself — she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ’s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:—Mr . Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note . In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but “
152873	153099	152855	152855	she	107	” When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt — putting every thing together — that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ . She was sorry , very sorry . Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove . CHAPTER X One morning , about ten days after Mrs. Churchill ’s decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who “
153114	153151	152855	152855	she	107	”—He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , “
153180	153181	153175	153175	She	90	” “
153186	153187	153183	153183	she	90	” “
153232	153233	153229	153229	you	2728	” “
153267	153268	153262	153262	she	90	” “
153297	153372	153279	153279	You	2728	” To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma . Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls . “
153373	153383	153384	153385	Mr. Weston	88	Now,”—said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now
153395	153396	153384	153385	Mr. Weston	88	” “
153399	153401	153403	153403	me	0	no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t
153442	153443	153432	153432	Emma	124	” “
153449	153456	153432	153432	Emma	124	” cried Emma , standing still with terror.—“Good
153490	153491	153481	153481	you	88	” “
153499	153501	153502	153503	Mr. Weston	88	” — “
153539	153540	153542	153542	my	0	” “
153547	153549	153550	153550	Your	124	” — “
153594	153595	153597	153597	my	0	” “
153600	153606	153597	153597	my	0	” said he very seriously , “
153629	153640	153641	153641	I	0	” Emma ’s courage returned , and she walked on . “
153645	153649	153641	153641	I	0	” he continued , “
153732	153844	153847	153850	that gentleman on horseback	2738	” Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort . She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern — something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,—something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward . Her fancy was very active . Half a dozen natural children , perhaps — and poor Frank cut off!—This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . It inspired little more than an animating curiosity . “
153852	153877	153847	153850	that gentleman on horseback	2738	” said she , as they proceeded — speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view . “
153910	153911	153900	153900	He	104	” “
153921	153922	153900	153900	He	104	” “
153937	153958	153961	153961	Frank	104	” For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , “
153975	153984	153961	153961	Frank	104	” They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well
153989	153997	154000	154000	her	3137	” said he , as they entered the room—“I
154037	154053	154059	154059	my	0	”—And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room,—“I
154069	154103	154062	154062	She	3137	” Mrs. Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ’s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , “
154170	154171	154173	154173	you	3137	” “
154178	154187	154173	154173	you	3137	” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice . “
154209	154210	154190	154190	you	3137	” “
154226	154227	154218	154220	Mr. Frank Churchill	104	” “
154245	154259	154239	154239	I	0	” ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up . ) “
154296	154313	154282	154282	He	104	” She stopped to breathe . Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet . “
154321	154326	154334	154334	you	3137	” resumed Mrs. Weston ; “
154365	154378	154359	154359	they	2750	” Emma even jumped with surprize;—and , horror - struck , exclaimed , “
154394	154395	154388	154388	You	3137	” “
154402	154426	154427	154427	You	124	” returned Mrs. Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover — “
154511	154553	154509	154509	him	2752	” Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between two ideas — her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation . “
154556	154567	154509	154509	him	2752	” said she at last , trying to recover herself ; “
154606	154607	154599	154601	either of them	2753	” “
154642	154652	154653	154653	I	0	” Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , “
154694	154715	154717	154717	you	2757	” Mrs. Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma ’s countenance was as steady as her words . “
154733	154737	154738	154738	I	0	” she continued , “
154834	154872	154825	154826	Mrs. Weston	90	” Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do . “
154884	154888	154873	154874	Mr. Weston	88	” said she . “
154931	154932	154923	154923	we	2756	” “
155067	155068	155072	155072	he	88	” “
155083	155084	155072	155072	he	88	” “
155135	155136	155145	155145	he	88	” “
155229	155230	155197	155197	he	88	” “
155306	155307	155317	155317	his	88	” “
155351	155352	155353	155354	Good God	184	” “
155356	155363	155353	155354	Good God	184	” cried Emma , not attending to her.—“Mrs
155406	155407	155408	155408	He	88	” “
155545	155552	155558	155558	him	88	” Emma began to listen better . “
155561	155566	155567	155567	He	88	” continued Mrs. Weston . “
155711	155712	155714	155714	His	88	” “
155718	155723	155714	155714	His	88	” replied Emma dryly , “
155744	155745	155739	155740	Mr. Churchill	104	” “
155843	155844	155836	155836	his	88	” “
155847	155851	155852	155852	he	88	” thought Emma , “
155861	155862	155852	155852	he	88	” “
156014	156015	156006	156006	his	104	” “
156046	156060	156038	156040	none of them	2785	” Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush . “
156085	156086	156066	156066	He	104	” “
156089	156093	156066	156066	He	104	” said Emma , “
156236	156237	156238	156238	I	0	” “
156246	156251	156238	156238	I	0	” replied Mrs. Weston . “
156275	156276	156277	156277	You	0	” “
156303	156304	156290	156290	you	0	” “
156350	156391	156344	156344	I	0	” At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , “
156550	156551	156581	156582	Jane Fairfax’s.—Of	342	” “
156556	156561	156581	156582	Jane Fairfax’s.—Of	342	” cried Emma feelingly . “
156606	156622	156627	156627	you	2803	” She met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming , “
156727	156875	156876	156876	Harriet	113	” A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done . CHAPTER XI “
156879	156996	156878	156879	poor Harriet!”—Those	343	Harriet!”—Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself — very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much _ his _ behaviour as her _ own _ , which made her so angry with him . It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet ’s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , “
157008	157181	156999	156999	you	124	”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ’s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend ’s happiness on most insufficient grounds . Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.—“But
157187	157191	156999	156999	you	124	” she added , “
157202	157507	156999	156999	you	124	” She was extremely angry with herself . If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.—Her days of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . This discovery laid many smaller matters open . No doubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane ’s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison . She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet ’s mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.—She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston ’s parting words . “
157559	157690	157693	157694	Miss Woodhouse	86	”—Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted . It was her superior duty . In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself . The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ’s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _ she _ was approaching Randalls . Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!—But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance . “
157696	157704	157693	157694	Miss Woodhouse	86	” cried Harriet , coming eagerly into the room—“is
157714	157715	157719	157719	you	2809	” “
157722	157744	157719	157719	you	2809	” replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint . “
157818	157819	157812	157812	he	88	” “
157825	157831	157834	157834	he	88	you?”—said Emma , still perplexed . “
157871	157932	157834	157834	he	88	” It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet ’s behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared absolutely changed . She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak . “
157938	157942	157957	157957	she	2812	” cried Harriet , “
157973	157974	157957	157957	she	2812	” “
157979	157983	157957	157957	she	2812	” said Emma , “
158075	158076	158077	158077	Me	0	” “
158079	158088	158077	158077	Me	0	” cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished . “
158104	158105	158106	158106	I	0	” “
158119	158125	158111	158111	you	0	” replied Emma , smiling ; “
158159	158160	158146	158146	you	0	” “
158176	158181	158182	158182	Harriet	113	” turning away distressed . “
158184	158192	158194	158194	you	113	” cried Emma , after a moment ’s pause—“What
158209	158275	158200	158200	you	113	” She could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer . Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma ’s . “
158284	158288	158200	158200	you	113	” she began , “
158492	158493	158494	158494	Harriet	113	” “
158496	158502	158517	158517	you	113	” cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely—“Let
158524	158525	158517	158517	you	113	” “
158563	158564	158590	158592	a different person	2821	” “
158568	158576	158590	158592	a different person	2821	” returned Emma , with forced calmness , “
158631	158632	158608	158608	I	0	” “
158643	158644	158635	158636	Miss Woodhouse	86	” “
158729	158730	158733	158733	dear	4014	” “
158735	158739	158733	158733	dear	4014	” cried Harriet , “
158859	158860	158862	158862	God	184	” “
158864	158868	158862	158862	God	184	” cried Emma , “
158884	158885	158886	158886	You	4014	” “
158935	158947	158948	158948	I	0	” She paused a few moments . Emma could not speak . “
158956	158960	158953	158954	Miss Woodhouse	86	” she resumed , “
159135	159159	159161	159161	you	86	” Harriet was standing at one of the windows . Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , “
159172	159173	159161	159161	you	86	” “
159176	159183	159187	159187	I	0	” replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully—“I
159190	160410	160412	160412	he	2830	” Emma ’s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes . A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart . A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress . She touched — she admitted — she acknowledged the whole truth . Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet ’s having some hope of a return ? It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself ! Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . How improperly had she been acting by Harriet ! How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! What blindness , what madness , had led her on ! It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits — some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley — but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ’s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained — or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.—Emma ’s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ’s , but they were not less . Her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create.—She listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to Harriet ’s detail.—Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit — especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley ’s most improved opinion of Harriet . Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ’s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case . She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him — and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet ’s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma . Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ’s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.—The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself — and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . ) He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:—The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield — though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes — and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _ her _ . The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain . On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question . “
160459	160494	160452	160452	Harriet	113	“ Mr. Martin ! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it . ”
160521	160534	160536	160536	she	113	“ I never should have presumed to think of it at first , ”
160538	160596	160536	160536	she	113	“ but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine — and so I have . But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . ”
160628	160668	160622	160622	her	124	“ Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . ”
160727	160743	160711	160711	He	422	“ She could not compose herself — Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed — she had better go;”—with
160777	160788	160773	160773	Emma	124	“ Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! ”
162978	162982	162983	162983	he	88	“ such things , ”
162986	162991	162983	162983	he	88	“ always got about . ”
163317	163335	163337	163338	Mrs. Weston	90	“ On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , ”
163340	163409	163337	163338	Mrs. Weston	90	“ she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ‘ I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart . ”
163410	163414	163416	163416	Emma	124	“ Poor girl ! ”
163418	163434	163416	163416	Emma	124	“ She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? ”
163435	163628	163337	163338	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ‘ The consequence , ’ said she , ‘ has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . ’ ‘ Do not imagine , madam , ’ she continued , ‘ that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . ’ ”
163629	163633	163635	163635	Emma	124	“ Poor girl ! ”
163638	163674	163635	163635	Emma	124	“ She loves him then excessively , I suppose . It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . ”
163675	163690	163337	163338	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . ”
163691	163696	163698	163698	Emma	124	“ I am afraid , ”
163702	163714	163698	163698	Emma	124	“ that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . ”
163715	163766	163767	163767	she	124	“ On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , ”
163770	163966	163767	163767	she	124	“ was that of making her _ unreasonable _ . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been — that had been — hard for him to bear . ‘ I did not make the allowances , ’ said she , ‘ which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits — his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ’ She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you — I could not thank you too much — for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . ”
163967	163979	163981	163981	Emma	124	“ If I did not know her to be happy now , ”
163985	164110	163981	163981	Emma	124	“ which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;—for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!—Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good — I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . ”
164205	164230	164231	164231	she	90	“ We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , ”
164266	164274	164276	164277	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Are you well , my Emma ? ”
164282	164309	164276	164277	Mrs. Weston	90	“ Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . ”
165525	165530	165509	165509	She	113	“ How d’ye do ’s ”
165573	165598	165600	165600	he	94	“ He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . ”—She
165761	165781	165748	165748	She	113	“ You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . ”
165782	165786	165788	165788	he	94	“ Have I ? ”
165796	165801	165788	165788	he	94	“ of what nature ? ”
165802	165815	165833	165833	he	94	“ Oh ! the best nature in the world — a wedding . ”
165836	165852	165833	165833	he	94	“ If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . ”
165853	165859	165861	165861	Emma	124	“ How is it possible ? ”
165893	165925	165881	165881	he	94	“ I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . ”
165942	165999	165926	165926	Emma	124	“ _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it — but—(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . ”
166051	166082	166037	166037	him	94	“ Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent sense — your exertions for your father ’s sake — I know you will not allow yourself—. ”
166101	166112	166090	166090	he	94	“ The feelings of the warmest friendship — Indignation — Abominable scoundrel!”—And
166124	166152	166120	166120	he	94	“ He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for _ her _ . She deserves a better fate . ”
166178	166272	166120	166120	he	94	“ You are very kind — but you are mistaken — and I must set you right . — I am not in want of that sort of compassion . My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier . ”
166273	166276	166278	166278	he	94	“ Emma ! ”
166285	166289	166278	166278	he	94	“ are you , indeed?”—but
166291	166418	166120	166120	he	94	himself—“No , no , I understand you — forgive me — I am pleased that you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!—I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt — I could only be certain that there was a preference — and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?—Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . ”
166419	166423	166425	166425	Emma	124	“ Mr. Knightley , ”
166434	166510	166425	166425	Emma	124	confused—“I am in a very extraordinary situation . I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I never have . ”
166565	166837	166559	166559	She	124	“ I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story , probably — a common case — and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding . Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr. Weston — he was continually here — I always found him very pleasant — and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last — my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions . Latterly , however — for some time , indeed — I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself — except that I was _ not _ blinded — that it was my good fortune — that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . ”
166891	166976	166888	166888	he	2901	“ I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him . My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no motive for wishing him ill — and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well . ”
166977	166988	166990	166990	Emma	124	“ I have no doubt of their being happy together , ”
166992	167005	166888	166888	he	2901	“ I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached . ”
167006	167014	167016	167017	Mr. Knightley	94	“ He is a most fortunate man ! ”
167022	167321	167016	167017	Mr. Knightley	94	“ So early in life — at three - and - twenty — a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman — the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ’s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,—equality of situation — I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one — and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment — and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used every body ill — and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a fortunate man indeed ! ”
167322	167331	167388	167388	she	124	“ You speak as if you envied him . ”
167332	167352	167353	167353	Emma	124	“ And I do envy him , Emma . In one respect he is the object of my envy . ”
167420	167476	167412	167413	Mr. Knightley	94	“ You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.—You are wise — but _ I _ can not be wise . Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment . ”
167477	167492	167493	167493	she	124	“ Oh ! then , do n’t speak it , do n’t speak it , ”
167497	167510	167541	167541	He	94	“ Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself . ”
167511	167515	167517	167517	he	94	“ Thank you , ”
167619	167628	167630	167630	he	94	“ You are going in , I suppose ? ”
167632	167633	167630	167630	he	94	“ No,”—replied
167646	167660	167644	167644	he	94	spoke—“I should like to take another turn . Mr. Perry is not gone . ”
167670	167744	167644	167644	he	94	added—“I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation — as a friend , indeed , you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like . I will tell you exactly what I think . ”
167745	167748	167749	167750	Mr. Knightley.—“Emma	355	“ As a friend!”—repeated
167750	167817	167818	167818	He	2905	Knightley.—“Emma , that I fear is a word — No , I have no wish — Stay , yes , why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far already for concealment.—Emma , I accept your offer — Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ? ”
167837	167842	167844	167844	he	2905	“ My dearest Emma , ”
167846	167887	167844	167844	he	2905	“ for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour ’s conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma — tell me at once . Say ‘ No , ’ if it is to be said . ”—She
167891	167895	167896	167896	he	2905	nothing.—“You are silent , ”
167903	167914	167896	167896	he	2905	“ absolutely silent ! at present I ask no more . ”
167945	167954	167955	167955	he	2905	“ I can not make speeches , Emma : ”
167974	168104	167955	167955	he	2905	convincing.—“If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more . But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them . The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them . God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes , you see , you understand my feelings — and will return them if you can . At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice . ”
170170	170321	170322	170322	Yours	2937	“ I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface.—We are quite well.—This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.—I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind.—I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not made him ill . “
170325	170328	170322	170322	Yours	2937	“ A. W. ”
170345	173623	170341	170343	MY DEAR MADAM	4914	“ If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.—You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . My courage rises while I write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.—You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . This was the fact . My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . I shall not discuss it here . For my temptation to _ think _ it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—Had she refused , I should have gone mad.—But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing , every thing — to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ’s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.—See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _ you _ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father ’s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object — but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.—She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I can not say;—when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree.—She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . I can not doubt it . You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account.—Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F — , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her.—The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her . She must tell you herself what she is — yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her.—She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend . I want to have your opinion of her looks . I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars . Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ’s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . If I could but see her again!—But I must not propose it yet . My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.—I must still add to this long letter . You have not heard all that you ought to hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult . , as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose . I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.—But I had no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman — Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself.—I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully . And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W. , in being unpleasant to Miss F. , were highly blameable . _ She _ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.—She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold . But she was always right . If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.—We quarrelled . — Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?—_There _ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable . Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected.—I was mad enough , however , to resent.—I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W. , as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.—In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.—‘Jane , ’ indeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with me , I shall soon have done.—She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.—_She _ _ felt _ _ the _ _ engagement _ _ to _ _ be _ _ a _ _ source _ _ of _ _ repentance _ _ and _ _ misery _ _ to _ _ each _ : _ she _ _ dissolved _ _ it_.—This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ’s death . I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and — may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at — : in short , the full direction to Mr. Smallridge ’s , near Bristol , stared me in the face . I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my uncle . Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different sort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake?—No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks.—I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away . But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ’s uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before . A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good fortune . I hope she is right.—In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL . CHAPTER XV This letter must make its way to Emma ’s feelings . She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold . As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed — and he had suffered , and was very sorry — and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr. Knightley came again , she desired him to read it . She was sure of Mrs. Weston ’s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct . “
173634	173638	173624	173624	I	0	” said he ; “
173654	173678	173644	173644	I	0	” But that would not do . Mr. Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him . “
173687	173691	173679	173679	I	0	” he replied ; “
173706	173719	173679	173679	I	0	” He began — stopping , however , almost directly to say , “
173757	173777	173778	173778	Humph	364	” He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , “
173810	173811	173804	173804	We	2944	” “
173819	173825	173817	173817	me	0	” he added shortly afterwards , “
173865	173866	173861	173861	you	2940	” “
173876	173887	173888	173888	He	2941	” Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . “
173892	173896	173888	173888	He	2941	” said he , “
173974	173975	173969	173970	Miss Fairfax	149	” “
173982	173986	173969	173970	Miss Fairfax	149	” said Emma , “
174014	174015	174009	174009	you	2940	” “
174048	174120	174041	174041	I	0	” When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud — all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus — “
174225	174252	174253	174253	You	88	” Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ’s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . “
174259	174275	174253	174253	You	88	” said she . He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , “
174357	174391	174345	174345	she	3225	” After this , he made some progress without any pause . Frank Churchill ’s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing . “
174398	174403	174392	174392	I	0	sir,”—was then his remark . “
174417	174456	174410	174410	You	88	” And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ’s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , “
174570	174656	174703	174703	she	3225	” Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable . Her own behaviour had been so very improper ! She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain — no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist . “
174673	174677	174703	174703	she	3225	” was his next observation.—“His
174724	174725	174717	174717	he	557	” “
174740	174741	174744	174744	he	557	” “
174747	174758	174742	174742	I	0	” replied Mr. Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . “
174770	174771	174772	174772	She	3225	” “
174813	174814	174807	174808	Mrs. Elton	201	” “
174853	174854	174855	174855	I	0	” “
174868	174869	174857	174857	you	124	” “
174998	174999	174990	174990	your	124	” “
175044	175045	175034	175034	I	0	” “
175199	175258	175180	175180	I	0	” The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma ’s answer was ready at the first word . “
175281	175660	175275	175275	She	149	” Part only of this answer , however , was admitted . The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to . He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ’s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted . But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father ’s happiness — in other words , his life — required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts . Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . She was sensible of all the affection it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with . She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself . “
175670	175674	175275	175275	She	149	” cried Emma . “
175695	176887	175685	175685	You	2970	” She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded . Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley ’s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt . This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield — the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!—Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy ! She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield . The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from . She would be a loser in every way . Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . In time , of course , Mr. Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early . Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—not like Mr. Elton . Mr. Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _ three _ men in one year . CHAPTER XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . Their intercourse was painful enough by letter . How much worse , had they been obliged to meet ! Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella ’s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss . Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist . Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her — and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.—When it was thus settled on her sister ’s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.—Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse ’s carriage.—It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square . Now Emma could , indeed , enjoy Mr. Knightley ’s visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself . The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard ’s , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma ’s sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself . She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied . There was a communication before her , one which _ she _ only could be competent to make — the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well . No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved — and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers . She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—She ought to go — and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . It would be a _ secret _ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went — she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.—She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.—No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , “
176892	176978	175685	175685	You	2970	up;”—and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.—Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted . — She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , “
177010	177256	177257	177257	We	2972	” Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton ’s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand . Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together . Miss Bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity . Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm . She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton ’s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ’s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ’s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , “
177360	177370	177352	177352	I	0	“ For when a lady ’s in the case , “
177379	177442	177461	177461	she	124	” Now I say , my dear , in _ our _ case , for _ lady _ , read —— mum ! a word to the wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits , an’t I ? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—_My _ representation , you see , has quite appeased her . ”
177469	177496	177461	177461	she	124	“ I mentioned no _ names _ , you will observe.—Oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . I managed it extremely well . ”
177538	177606	177531	177531	she	124	“ Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?—(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane . ) Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!”—And
177619	177656	177608	177609	Mrs. Bates	112	“ We do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.—Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit . ”
177657	177671	177672	177672	she	112	“ I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , ”
177677	177788	177672	177672	she	112	“ since the party to Box Hill . Very pleasant party . But yet I think there was something wanting . Things did not seem — that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken . However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts?—It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _ one _ exception . ”
177834	177911	177913	177913	her	124	“ Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.—It is impossible to say — Yes , indeed , I quite understand — dearest Jane ’s prospects — that is , I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little circle as you find us here.—Yes , indeed.—Charming young man!—that is — so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!”—And
177974	178034	177966	177967	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you . ”
178035	178075	177966	177967	Mrs. Elton	201	“ What ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will be a favour indeed ! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton ’s time is so engaged . ”
178076	178214	177966	177967	Mrs. Elton	201	“ Upon my word it is , Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to night.—There is no end of people ’s coming to him , on some pretence or other.—The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion . They seem not able to do any thing without him.—‘Upon my word , Mr. E. , ’ I often say , ‘ rather you than I.—I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . ’—Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.—However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . ”
178225	178237	178218	178218	her	2979	Emma—“A congratulatory visit , you know.—Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . ”
178248	178284	178238	178239	Miss Bates	107	“ He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.—Mr . E. is Knightley ’s right hand . ”
178298	178313	178285	178285	Emma	124	“ Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk . ”
178314	178362	178238	178239	Miss Bates	107	“ Oh ! no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way . ”
178363	178371	178373	178373	Emma	124	“ Have not you mistaken the day ? ”
178375	178407	178373	178373	Emma	124	“ I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.—Mr . Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday . ”
178408	178421	178238	178239	Miss Bates	107	“ Oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to - day , ”
178438	178442	178443	178443	she	124	side.—“I do believe , ”
178446	178467	178443	178443	she	124	“ this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove . ”
178468	178475	178477	178477	Jane	107	“ Your parish there was small , ”
178479	178501	178477	178477	Jane	107	“ Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of . ”
178502	178548	178443	178443	she	124	“ But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children . ”
178549	178627	178477	178477	Jane	107	“ Ah ! you clever creature , that ’s very true . What a thinking brain you have ! I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together . My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _ some _ people may not think _ you _ perfection already.—But hush!—not a word , if you please . ”
178701	178789	178697	178697	her	2184	“ Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience — for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ? ”
178841	178848	178850	178850	he	97	“ When I got to Donwell , ”
178852	178890	178850	178850	he	97	“ Knightley could not be found . Very odd ! very unaccountable ! after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . ”
178891	178894	178896	178896	his	97	“ Donwell ! ”
178897	178921	178850	178850	he	97	wife.—“My dear Mr. E. , you have not been to Donwell!—You mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown . ”
178922	179051	179052	179052	Emma	124	“ No , no , that ’s to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill - usage , ) which made it so much the worse . And then not to find him at home ! I assure you I am not at all pleased . And no apology left , no message for me . The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone . Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.—Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it ? ”
179077	179083	179085	179086	Mrs. Elton	201	“ I can not imagine , ”
179100	179237	179085	179086	Mrs. Elton	201	“ I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it . ”
179238	179244	179246	179247	Mr. Elton	97	“ I met William Larkins , ”
179249	179361	179246	179247	Mr. Elton	97	“ as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him.—William seemed rather out of humour . He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . I have nothing to do with William ’s wants , but it really is of very great importance that _ I _ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose . ”
179452	179510	179443	179443	she	124	“ It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent . ”
179511	179514	179516	179516	Jane	149	“ Oh ! ”
179540	179675	179690	179690	Emma	124	composure—“there would have been no danger . The danger would have been of my wearying you . You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest—. Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to — I have not time for half that I could wish to say . I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . I feel it so very due . But , unfortunately — in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend — ”
179676	179688	179690	179690	Emma	124	“ Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , ”
179698	179727	179690	179690	Emma	124	“ You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even — ”
179728	179765	179690	179690	Emma	124	“ You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know that I must have disgusted you . ”
179766	179822	179690	179690	Emma	124	“ Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side . Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there . I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ? ”
179823	179826	179690	179690	Emma	124	“ Very . ”
179827	179854	179690	179690	Emma	124	“ And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you — just as I begin to know you . ”
179855	179883	179690	179690	Emma	124	“ Oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . ”
179884	179894	179896	179896	Emma	124	“ Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , ”
179898	179909	179896	179896	Emma	124	smiling—“but , excuse me , it must be thought of . ”
179918	179993	179915	179915	Jane	149	“ You are very right ; it has been thought of . And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for . ”
179994	180031	180075	180075	She	124	“ Thank you , thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh ! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!—Good - bye , good - bye . ”
180223	180238	180239	180239	she	124	“ She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , ”
180240	180274	180281	180282	Mr. Knightley	94	continued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ’ Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . ”
180275	180279	180281	180282	Mr. Knightley	94	“ That is , ”
180284	180314	180281	180282	Mr. Knightley	94	“ she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . It will be the only difference . ”
180315	180319	180321	180321	Emma	124	“ Poor child ! ”
180323	180334	180321	180321	Emma	124	“ at that rate , what will become of her ? ”
180335	180399	180400	180400	Emma	124	“ Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . I , who am owing all my happiness to _ you _ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ? ”
180406	180437	180400	180400	Emma	124	“ But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . ”
180438	180575	180321	180321	Emma	124	“ Do you?—I have no doubt . Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor gave you principles . You must have done well . My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . I do not believe I did you any good . The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . ”
180576	180587	180589	180589	Emma	124	“ I am sure you were of use to me , ”
180591	180662	180589	180589	Emma	124	“ I was very often influenced rightly by you — oftener than I would own at the time . I am very sure you did me good . And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . ”
180663	180736	180321	180321	Emma	124	“ How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks—‘Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ’s leave’—something which , you knew , I did not approve . In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . ”
180737	180755	180321	180321	Emma	124	“ What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . ”
180756	180805	180589	180589	Emma	124	“ ‘ Mr. Knightley . ’—You always called me , ‘ Mr. Knightley ; ’ and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal . I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what . ”
180806	180853	180321	180321	Emma	124	“ I remember once calling you ‘ George , ’ in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again . ”
180854	180866	180321	180321	Emma	124	“ And can not you call me ‘ George ’ now ? ”
180867	180904	180905	180905	she	3004	“ Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘ Mr. Knightley . ’ I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise , ”
180911	180948	180905	180905	she	3004	blushing—“I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . ”
181280	181289	181291	181292	Mr. Knightley	94	“ John does not even mention your friend , ”
181294	181307	181291	181292	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Here is his answer , if you like to see it . ”
181356	181366	181368	181369	Mr. Knightley	94	“ John enters like a brother into my happiness , ”
181371	181430	181368	181369	Mr. Knightley	94	“ but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . ”
181431	181439	181441	181441	Emma	124	“ He writes like a sensible man , ”
181450	181519	181441	181441	Emma	124	“ I honour his sincerity . It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . ”
181520	181534	181368	181369	Mr. Knightley	94	“ My Emma , he means no such thing . He only means — ”
181535	181550	181552	181552	she	3015	“ He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , ”
181559	181582	181552	181552	she	3015	smile—“much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . ”
181583	181590	181368	181369	Mr. Knightley	94	“ Emma , my dear Emma — ”
181591	181594	181595	181595	she	3015	“ Oh ! ”
181602	181695	181595	181595	she	3015	“ if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion . Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _ you _ justice . He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine . I wish I may not sink into ‘ poor Emma ’ with him at once.—His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther . ”
181696	181699	181700	181700	he	3015	“ Ah ! ”
181703	181777	181700	181700	he	3015	“ I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together . I am amused by one part of John ’s letter — did you notice it?—where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind . ”
181778	181812	181595	181595	she	3015	“ If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying . He had no idea of me . He seems perfectly unprepared for that . ”
181813	181921	181700	181700	he	3015	“ Yes , yes — but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings . What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so , I suppose . I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day . I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual . I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ‘ Uncle seems always tired now . ’ ”
182954	182970	182942	182942	he	438	saying—“Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way . ”
183169	183180	183182	183182	he	88	“ It is to be a secret , I conclude , ”
183184	183220	183182	183182	he	88	“ These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . ”
183434	183445	183431	183431	he	97	“ the young lady ’s pride would now be contented ; ”
183448	183460	183431	183431	he	97	“ she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; ”
183475	183479	183431	183431	he	97	“ Rather he than I!”—But
183486	183495	183431	183431	he	97	indeed.—“Poor Knightley ! poor fellow!—sad business for him . ”—She
183729	183742	183714	183714	he	94	“ I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . ”
183743	183748	183750	183750	she	124	“ Good or bad ? ”
183760	183772	183750	183750	she	124	“ I do not know which it ought to be called . ”
183773	183793	183714	183714	he	94	“ Oh ! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile . ”
183794	183799	183801	183801	he	94	“ I am afraid , ”
183807	183828	183801	183801	he	94	“ I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . ”
183829	183855	183714	183714	he	94	“ Indeed ! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too . ”
183856	183862	183863	183863	he	94	“ There is one subject , ”
183866	183880	183863	183863	he	94	“ I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . ”
183897	183908	183890	183890	his	94	“ Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet Smith . ”
183929	183939	183941	183941	he	94	“ Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? ”
183943	183955	183941	183941	he	94	“ You have , I believe , and know the whole . ”
183956	183971	184010	184010	her	124	“ No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . ”
183972	183995	183996	183996	Emma	124	“ You are prepared for the worst , I see — and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . ”
184019	184026	184010	184010	her	124	“ No , this is impossible ! ”
184033	184040	184042	184043	Mr. Knightley	94	“ It is so , indeed , ”
184045	184063	184042	184043	Mr. Knightley	94	“ I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . ”
184076	184135	184064	184064	She	124	“ You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . ”
184136	184146	184147	184147	she	124	“ You mistake me , you quite mistake me , ”
184153	184216	184147	184147	she	124	“ It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it . It seems an impossibility!—You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again — yet . You only mean , that he intends it . ”
184217	184226	184228	184229	Mr. Knightley	94	“ I mean that he has done it , ”
184237	184242	184228	184229	Mr. Knightley	94	“ and been accepted . ”
184243	184247	184248	184248	she	124	“ Good God ! ”
184249	184285	184228	184229	Mr. Knightley	94	cried.—“Well!”—Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , “
184334	184335	184324	184324	I	0	” “
184684	184740	184741	184741	Emma	124	” He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad . Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , “
184871	184898	184899	184899	You	124	” He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly — she did — cheerfully answering , “
184996	184997	184975	184975	I	0	” “
185006	185011	184998	184998	You	124	” replied Mr. Knightley ; “
185047	185057	185059	185059	my	0	” Emma could not help laughing as she answered , “
185161	185219	185157	185159	some famous ox	3079	” The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma ’s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet ’s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , “
185234	185257	185231	185232	Robert Martin	118	” that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature . It could not be otherwise . “
185264	185269	185259	185259	you	0	” cried Mr. Knightley . “
185295	185296	185271	185271	you	0	” “
185347	185348	185334	185334	you	0	” “
185354	185362	185334	185334	you	0	” he replied , speaking very distinctly , “
185481	185482	185465	185465	he	118	” “
185488	185497	185483	185483	I	0	” replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , “
185505	185506	185507	185507	You	0	” “
185519	185520	185507	185507	You	0	” “
185534	185535	185531	185532	a fool	5475	” “
185696	185697	185690	185690	she	113	” “
185700	185706	185690	185690	she	113	” cried Emma , shaking her head.—“Ah
185711	186206	185709	185709	Harriet	113	” She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . She was not sorry . She wanted to be alone . Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational . Her father ’s business was to announce James ’s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing . The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet ’s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.—What had she to wish for ? Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . She must laugh at such a close ! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart — such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure in her returning — Every thing would be a pleasure . It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over . The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed . They arrived.—Mrs . Weston was alone in the drawing - room:—but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window . “
186214	186219	186211	186212	Miss Fairfax	149	” said Mrs. Weston . “
186264	186418	186261	186261	I	0	” In half a minute they were in the room . Emma was extremely glad to see him — but there was a degree of confusion — a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure . When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation — or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , “
186465	186466	186461	186461	you	3092	” “
186471	186480	186461	186461	you	3092	” cried Emma , most happy to begin , “
186506	186530	186486	186486	I	0	” He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . “
186537	186547	186550	186550	she	90	” said he , turning his eyes towards Jane . “
186566	186606	186560	186561	Mrs. Weston	90	” But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.—Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . “
186614	186618	186560	186561	Mrs. Weston	90	” she cried , “
186623	186624	186560	186561	Mrs. Weston	90	” “
186628	186632	186635	186635	mine	0	” he answered , “
186664	186665	186660	186660	you	0	” “
186676	186677	186672	186672	I	0	” “
186744	186745	186732	186732	I	0	” “
186754	186758	186732	186732	I	0	” said Emma . “
186764	186768	186759	186759	I	0	” resumed he , “
186854	186875	186850	186850	you	0	” Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , “
186882	186893	186850	186850	you	0	” then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment—“I
186900	186905	186907	186907	you	0	” He paused.—She coloured and laughed.—“I
186953	186993	186943	186951	a man whom I can not presume to praise	3100	” Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were , “
187048	187049	187050	187050	I	0	” “
187057	187063	187050	187050	I	0	” replied Emma , archly ; “
187092	187093	187088	187088	you	0	” “
187108	187125	187105	187105	I	0	” But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying , “
187162	187163	187174	187174	you	0	” “
187189	187190	187184	187187	the most miserable wretch	3104	” “
187264	187268	187254	187254	I	0	” He bowed . “
187275	187287	187254	187254	I	0	” she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , “
187314	187315	187338	187339	no superior	3106	” “
187320	187326	187338	187339	no superior	3106	” he answered , warmly . “
187440	187441	187436	187436	her	3107	” “
187447	187463	187436	187436	her	3107	” replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , “
187505	187635	187491	187491	I	0	” The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ’s appearing not quite well . She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry . Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . “

The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced . CHAPTER XIX If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied — unaccountable as it was!—that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness . Harriet was a little distressed — did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ’s approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.—Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley ’s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . But what did such particulars explain?—The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.—Harriet ’s parentage became known . She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.—Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley — or for the Churchills — or even for Mr. Elton!—The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . No objection was raised on the father ’s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet ’s happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;—or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself . Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted.—The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner . Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them , could impair.—Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr. Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November . The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr. Knightley.—They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ’s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan.—John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it . But Mr. Woodhouse — how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?—he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event . When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless.—A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain.—He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it — a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation . Still , however , he was not happy . Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter ’s courage failed . She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated — she could not proceed . In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse ’s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way.—Mrs . Weston ’s poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys — evidently by the ingenuity of man . Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.—Pilfering was _ housebreaking _ to Mr. Woodhouse ’s fears.—He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law ’s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life . The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe.—But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November . The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day — and Mr. Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse . The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs. Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own.—“Very
