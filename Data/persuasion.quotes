208	214	215	216	Walter Elliot	94	“ ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL . “
296	337	344	344	Charles	100	” Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer ’s hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary ’s birth—“Married
364	470	495	496	Heir presumptive	235	” and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife . Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto:—“Principal
482	494	495	496	Heir presumptive	235	” and Sir Walter ’s handwriting again in this finale : — “
513	2223	505	511	great grandson of the second Sir Walter	236	” Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot ’s character ; vanity of person and of situation . He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man . Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion . His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own . Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards . She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them . Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father . She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters . This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot ’s death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow . That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman _ does _ marry again , than when she does _ not ; _ but Sir Walter ’s continuing in singleness requires explanation . Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ’ sake . For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother ’s rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . His two other children were of very inferior value . Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way — she was only Anne . To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend . Lady Russell loved them all ; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again . A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem . He had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work . All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore _ given _ all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably . It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing . Anne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow ’s foot about Lady Russell ’s temples had long been a distress to him . Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment . Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country . Thirteen winters ’ revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ’ annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not . Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away . She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of . The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq . , whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her . She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot ’s death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction . He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed . He was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came . The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth . Sir Walter had resented it . As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; “
2232	2236	505	511	great grandson of the second Sir Walter	236	” he observed , “
2253	2813	505	511	great grandson of the second Sir Walter	236	” His disapprobation was expressed , but apparently very little regarded . Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased . This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father ’s heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in _ him _ a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot ’s eldest daughter . There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal . Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . The disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . This could not be pardoned . Such were Elizabeth Elliot ’s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy . But now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these . Her father was growing distressed for money . She knew , that when he now took up the Baronetage , it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople , and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd , his agent , from his thoughts . The Kellynch property was good , but not equal to Sir Walter ’s apprehension of the state required in its possessor . While Lady Elliot lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right - mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it . It had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter . He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , “
2835	3661	3666	3666	your	243	” and Elizabeth , to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing - room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne , as had been the usual yearly custom . But these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards . Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy . She felt herself ill - used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne . There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference . He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell . No ; he would never disgrace his name so far . The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire , as he had received it . Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called on to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride . CHAPTER II . Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the _ disagreeable _ prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted . Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles . She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter ’s feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding . She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent — but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth . She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted Anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter . Every emendation of Anne ’s had been on the side of honesty against importance . She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity . “
3672	3682	3666	3666	your	243	” said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , “
3885	4084	3881	3883	an honest man	254	” This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell ’s influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation . Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell ’s too gentle reductions . How Anne ’s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence . Lady Russell ’s had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne . “
4143	4144	4125	4125	he	256	” “
4149	4189	4125	4125	he	256	” The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter ’s retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . “
4210	4214	4205	4205	he	256	” he said , “
4293	4937	5429	5430	Sir Walter	94	” Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out . There had been three alternatives , London , Bath , or another house in the country . All Anne ’s wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell ’s society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home . Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell ’s spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there . Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne ’s known wishes . It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter ’s feelings they must have been dreadful . And with regard to Anne ’s dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother ’s death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend ’s health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good . Anne had been too little from home , too little seen . Her spirits were not high . A larger society would improve them . She wanted her to be more known . The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . He was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than Sir Walter ’s have found too much . Kellynch Hall was to be let . This , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle . Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word “
4940	5421	5429	5430	Sir Walter	94	” but never dared approach it again . Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all . How quick come the reasons for approving what we like ! Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country . Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted . It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father ’s house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing — the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve . Lady Russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because Elizabeth deserved it . She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility . From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell ’s estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot ’s reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance . CHAPTER III . “
5432	5449	5429	5430	Sir Walter	94	” said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall , as he laid down the newspaper , “
5526	5527	5523	5524	Sir Walter	94	” “
5538	5543	5536	5536	Shepherd	107	” replied Sir Walter ; “
5582	5601	5580	5580	Shepherd	107	” Mr Shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added — “
5875	5895	5906	5906	I	0	” Sir Walter only nodded . But soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically — “
5924	5925	5926	5926	They	274	” “
5941	5976	5926	5926	They	274	” said Mrs Clay , for Mrs Clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay ’s health as a drive to Kellynch : “
6091	6092	6079	6080	Miss Elliot	98	” “
6098	6104	6079	6080	Miss Elliot	98	” rejoined Sir Walter coolly , “
6249	6261	6239	6239	I	0	” After a short pause , Mr Shepherd presumed to say — “
6337	6342	6343	6344	The navy	296	” Here Anne spoke — “
6397	6398	6406	6407	Miss Anne	98	” “
6414	6422	6406	6407	Miss Anne	98	” was Mr Shepherd ’s rejoinder , and “
6427	6443	6406	6407	Miss Anne	98	” was his daughter ’s ; but Sir Walter ’s remark was , soon afterwards — “
6465	6466	6451	6451	I	0	” “
6469	6481	6451	6451	I	0	” was the reply , and with a look of surprise . “
6903	6904	6907	6908	Sir Walter	94	” “
6910	6915	6907	6908	Sir Walter	94	” cried Mrs Clay , “
7063	7075	7077	7078	the clergyman	332	” she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;—“and
7225	7484	7186	7186	I	0	” It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter ’s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent . By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing—(it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter ’s concerns could not be kept a secret,)—accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd ’s ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant . “
7491	7529	7530	7530	He	114	” was Sir Walter ’s cold suspicious inquiry . Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman ’s family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added — “
7566	7567	7555	7555	he	114	” “
7575	7580	7555	7555	he	114	” observed Sir Walter , “
7597	7885	7582	7582	his	114	” Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman . Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral ’s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for . A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . “
7903	7907	7898	7898	she	342	” continued he ; “
8044	8064	8065	8065	I	0	” But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot , that she did not hear the appeal . “
8091	8092	8087	8089	old Governor Trent	117	” “
8192	8198	8199	8199	You	360	” After waiting another moment — “
8207	8217	8201	8202	Mr Wentworth	118	” said Anne . Mr Shepherd was all gratitude . “
8274	8275	8276	8276	Wentworth	118	” “
8344	8617	8618	8618	I	0	” As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter ’s estimate of the dues of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen . Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer . So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral ’s situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . “
8627	8821	8624	8625	Admiral Croft	114	” would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere _ Mr. _ — — ; a _ Mr. _ ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation , ) always needs a note of explanation . An admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small . In all their dealings and intercourse , Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence . Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her . Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had such an end been reached , than Anne , who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh , “
8839	11193	8829	8829	he	114	” CHAPTER IV . _ He _ was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford . He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and Anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling . Half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail . They were gradually acquainted , and when acquainted , rapidly and deeply in love . It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted . A short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one . Troubles soon arose . Sir Walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter . He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of ! Anne Elliot , so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth - killing dependence ! It must not be , if by any fair interference of friendship , any representations from one who had almost a mother ’s love , and mother ’s rights , it would be prevented . Captain Wentworth had no fortune . He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted . He had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still . Such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for Anne ; but Lady Russell saw it very differently . His sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her . She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil . It only added a dangerous character to himself . He was brilliant , he was headstrong . Lady Russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror . She deprecated the connexion in every light . Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat . Young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father ’s ill - will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but Lady Russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain . She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it . Had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up . The belief of being prudent , and self - denying , principally for _ his _ advantage , was her chief consolation , under the misery of a parting , a final parting ; and every consolation was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . He had left the country in consequence . A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne ’s share of suffering from it . Her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect . More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ) , or in any novelty or enlargement of society . No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth , as he stood in her memory . No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter ’s , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father ’s house , and settled so permanently near herself . But in this case , Anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though Lady Russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne ’s being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits . They knew not each other ’s opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne ’s conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good . She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . All his sanguine expectations , all his confidence had been justified . His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path . He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place . He had distinguished himself , and early gained the other step in rank , and must now , by successive captures , have made a handsome fortune . She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married . How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been ! how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over - anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning . With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that Captain Wentworth ’s sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea . She often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil . She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it . She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell ’s motives in this , over those of her father and Elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of Admiral Croft ’s really taking Kellynch Hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short - lived engagement . That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature ’s having heard of it from him . The sister , Mrs Croft , had then been out of England , accompanying her husband on a foreign station , and her own sister , Mary , had been at school while it all occurred ; and never admitted by the pride of some , and the delicacy of others , to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards . With these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts , which , with Lady Russell , still resident in Kellynch , and Mary fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness . CHAPTER V. On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft ’s seeing Kellynch Hall , Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell ’s , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them . This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once . Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral ’s side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd ’s assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding . The house and grounds , and furniture , were approved , the Crofts were approved , terms , time , every thing , and every body , was right ; and Mr Shepherd ’s clerks were set to work , without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that “
11198	11276	8829	8829	he	114	” Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , “
11320	11634	11635	11635	I	0	”—reciprocal compliments , which would have been esteemed about equal . The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas ; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement . Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath , and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country , did not think that , everything considered , she wished to remain . It would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others . Something occurred , however , to give her a different duty . Mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day ’s health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath . “
11643	11655	11635	11635	I	0	” was Mary ’s reasoning ; and Elizabeth ’s reply was , “
11673	12168	11666	11666	nobody	1740	” To be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and Anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay . This invitation of Mary ’s removed all Lady Russell ’s difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge . So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay ’s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her . Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to Anne , in Mrs Clay ’s being of so much use , while Anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation . Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell . With a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father ’s character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind . Mrs Clay had freckles , and a projecting tooth , and a clumsy wrist , which he was continually making severe remarks upon , in her absence ; but she was young , and certainly altogether well - looking , and possessed , in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners , infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been . Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . She had little hope of success ; but Elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought , have reason to reproach her for giving no warning . She spoke , and seemed only to offend . Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party ’s perfectly knowing their situation . “
12172	12178	11666	11666	nobody	1740	” said she , warmly , “
12421	12422	12414	12414	him	276	” “
12430	12434	12414	12414	him	276	” replied Anne , “
12446	12447	12448	12448	I	0	” “
12453	12459	12448	12448	I	0	” answered Elizabeth , shortly ; “
12512	13117	13118	13120	a fine girl	393	” Anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good . Elizabeth , though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it . The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath . The party drove off in very good spirits ; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves , and Anne walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the Lodge , where she was to spend the first week . Her friend was not in better spirits than herself . Lady Russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly . Their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit . It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne . Accordingly their removal was made together , and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of Lady Russell ’s journey . Uppercross was a moderate - sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear - tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ’ squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller ’s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on . Here Anne had often been staying . She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch . The two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other ’s house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course . Though better endowed than the elder sister , Mary had not Anne ’s understanding nor temper . While well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely . She had no resources for solitude ; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self - importance , was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill - used . In person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being “
13122	13172	13118	13120	a fine girl	393	” She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on Anne ’s appearing , greeted her with — “
13210	13211	13212	13212	I	0	” “
13220	13224	13212	13212	I	0	” replied Anne . “
13237	13238	13225	13225	You	394	” “
13341	13354	13330	13330	she	106	” Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband . “
13422	13423	13424	13424	You	0	” “
13433	13434	13424	13424	You	0	” “
13478	13479	13471	13471	Walter	94	” “
13489	13495	13496	13496	You	397	” replied Anne , cheerfully . “
13515	13516	13517	13517	I	0	” “
13599	13600	13590	13590	they	400	” “
13619	13620	13621	13621	I	0	” “
13664	13665	13657	13657	you	397	” “
13760	13761	13762	13762	Dear	403	” “
13775	13776	13782	13782	I	0	” “
13941	13942	13896	13896	Mary	99	” “
13947	13955	13896	13896	Mary	99	” and after a moment ’s pause , “
13972	13973	13957	13957	you	99	” “
13999	14000	13986	13986	I	0	” “
14035	14036	14037	14037	I	0	” “
14055	14056	14047	14047	I	0	” “
14159	14248	14142	14142	I	0	” A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne ’s side produced nearly a cure on Mary ’s . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . “
14254	14263	14142	14142	I	0	” said she , when they were ready . “
14284	14285	14286	14286	I	0	” “
14296	14300	14286	14286	I	0	” replied Anne . “
14323	14324	14319	14321	the Miss Musgroves	123	” “
14382	15071	15074	15075	Miss Anne	98	” Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it . To the Great House accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction . Oh ! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on , have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness ! The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment . The Musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement . The father and mother were in the old English style , and the young people in the new . Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people ; friendly and hospitable , not much educated , and not at all elegant . Their children had more modern minds and manners . There was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting Charles , were Henrietta and Louisa , young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry . Their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad . Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good - humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters . They were received with great cordiality . Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as Anne very well knew , the least to blame . The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised , at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at Mary ’s particular invitation . CHAPTER VI . Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross , to learn that a removal from one set of people to another , though at a distance of only three miles , will often include a total change of conversation , opinion , and idea . She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : “
15098	15118	15119	15119	I	0	” and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ’ addition of , “
15158	15167	15168	15168	my	0	” or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of—“Upon
15190	15753	15754	15754	I	0	” She could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell . The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music . She acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into . With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible . She had no dread of these two months . Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else . He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ’s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne ’s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ) , they might pass for a happy couple . They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father ’s having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked . As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife ’s , and his practice not so bad . “
15770	15798	15799	15799	Charles	101	” was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary ’s reproach of “
15814	15824	15799	15799	Charles	101	” she never had the smallest temptation to say , “
15828	15893	15799	15799	Charles	101	” One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house . Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . “
15908	15925	15896	15896	you	433	” was Charles ’s language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : “
15979	15985	15986	15986	I	0	” Mary ’s declaration was , “
16044	16061	16064	16065	Miss Anne	98	” And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne , to say , “
16222	16228	16213	16213	one	1726	“ do n’t do this , ”
16230	16236	16213	16213	one	1726	“ do n’t do that ; ”
16255	16266	16267	16268	Mrs Musgrove	101	” She had this communication , moreover , from Mary . “
16386	16397	16398	16398	I	0	” And on Mrs Musgrove ’s side , it was , “
16550	16641	16642	16642	I	0	” Again , it was Mary ’s complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , “
16769	17320	17323	17324	Miss Anne	98	” How was Anne to set all these matters to rights ? She could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ’s benefit . In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well . Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ; Mary ’s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove ’s respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters . She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware . She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation . Excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste . In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove ’s fond partiality for their own daughters ’ performance , and total indifference to any other person ’s , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own . The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company . The neighbourhood was not large , but the Musgroves were visited by everybody , and had more dinner - parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance , than any other family . They were more completely popular . The girls were wild for dancing ; and the evenings ended , occasionally , in an unpremeditated little ball . There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and Anne , very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else , and often drew this compliment;—“Well
17344	17436	17437	17437	Dear	403	” So passed the first three weeks . Michaelmas came ; and now Anne ’s heart must be in Kellynch again . A beloved home made over to others ; all the precious rooms and furniture , groves , and prospects , beginning to own other eyes and other limbs ! She could not think of much else on the 29th of September ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary , who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed , “
17470	17493	17494	17494	Nobody	1740	” The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness , and were to be visited . Mary deplored the necessity for herself . “
17513	17910	17502	17502	She	1740	” but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back . Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going . She wished , however , to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour . Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft ’s side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft ’s suddenly saying , — “
17941	17962	17913	17913	you	469	” Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not . “
17974	18092	17964	17964	you	469	” added Mrs Croft . She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when Mrs Croft ’s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother . She immediately felt how reasonable it was , that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward , and not of Frederick ; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour ’s present state with proper interest . The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary — “
18114	18356	18110	18110	him	474	” He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c. , to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question . She could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the Crofts had previously been calling . The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage . “
18365	18369	18358	18358	I	0	” she added , “
18613	18744	18746	18746	Richard	120	” The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross , two years before . He had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him “
18748	19309	18746	18746	Richard	120	” been nothing better than a thick - headed , unfeeling , unprofitable Dick Musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead . He had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth ’s frigate , the Laconia ; and from the Laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money . In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur . She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death . Mr Musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them . To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it _ might _ , that it probably _ would _ , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton — a very fine young man — but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne ’s nerves . She found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself . Since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick ’s having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as “
19322	20177	19310	19313	a fine dashing felow	485	” were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival . The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening . CHAPTER VII . A very few days more , and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch , and Mr Musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week . It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . But a week must pass ; only a week , in Anne ’s reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week . Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove ’s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour . She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy ’s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The child ’s situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account . His collar - bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas . It was an afternoon of distress , and Anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants . Her brother ’s return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary . Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ’s state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth ’s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before . How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma ’s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow — actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought . And in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles . The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and Mr Musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting . “
20188	20238	20184	20186	the little boy	2213	” both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and Anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs . Charles Musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; “
20288	20301	20308	20308	Charles	101	” But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with “
20327	20500	20308	20308	Charles	101	” The child had a good night , and was going on well the next day . It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine ; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm , and Charles Musgrove began , consequently , to feel no necessity for longer confinement . The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible ; but what was there for a father to do ? This was quite a female case , and it would be highly absurd in him , who could be of no use at home , to shut himself up . His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house . “
20511	20515	20308	20308	Charles	101	” said he ; “
20583	20650	20572	20572	Anne	98	” Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles ’s manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him . She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only Anne to hear — “
20869	20870	20861	20861	You	0	” “
20964	20965	20966	20966	I	0	” “
21050	21051	21040	21040	I	0	” “
21072	21073	21055	21055	you	0	” “
21150	21151	21134	21134	I	0	” “
21202	21203	21187	21190	Mr and Mrs Musgrove	122	” “
21208	21216	21205	21205	you	0	” cried Mary , her eyes brightening . “
21434	21481	21482	21482	I	0	” The next moment she was tapping at her husband ’s dressing - room door , and as Anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with Mary ’s saying , in a tone of great exultation — “
21584	21585	21591	21591	Anne	98	” “
21593	21600	21591	21591	Anne	98	” was her husband ’s answer , “
21633	22422	21625	21625	herself	98	” Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ? She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting . Perhaps indifferent , if indifference could exist under such circumstances . He must be either indifferent or unwilling . Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting . Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general . There had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in Captain Wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles . He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove ’s way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in Charles ’s being to meet him to breakfast at his father ’s . Anne understood it . He wished to avoid seeing her . He had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet . The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child ’s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . And it was soon over . In two minutes after Charles ’s preparation , the others appeared ; they were in the drawing - room . Her eye half met Captain Wentworth ’s , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to Mary , said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it . Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could . “
22431	22444	21625	21625	herself	98	” she repeated to herself again and again , in nervous gratitude . “
22450	22684	22685	22686	Captain Wentworth	120	” Mary talked , but she could not attend . She had seen him . They had met . They had been once more in the same room . Soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less . Eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up . How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness ! What might not eight years do ? Events of every description , changes , alienations , removals — all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past — how natural , how certain too ! It included nearly a third part of her own life . Alas ! with all her reasoning , she found , that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing . Now , how were his sentiments to be read ? Was this like wishing to avoid her ? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question . On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : — “
22736	22765	22719	22719	he	120	” Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister ’s in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound . “
22771	22870	22719	22719	he	120	” Anne fully submitted , in silent , deep mortification . Doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse . She had already acknowledged it to herself , and she could not think differently , let him think of her as he would . No : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages . She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth . “
22882	23205	22874	22874	he	120	” These were words which could not but dwell with her . Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier . Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven Anne Elliot . She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure . She had given him up to oblige others . It had been the effect of over - persuasion . It had been weakness and timidity . He had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again . Her power with him was gone for ever . It was now his object to marry . He was rich , and being turned on shore , fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted ; actually looking round , ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow . He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting Anne Elliot . This was his only secret exception , when he said to his sister , in answer to her suppositions : — “
23278	23326	23229	23229	me	0	” He said it , she knew , to be contradicted . His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with . “
23336	23347	23229	23229	me	0	” made the first and the last of the description . “
23355	23359	23350	23353	the woman I want	542	” said he . “
23404	23541	23388	23389	a fool	1751	” CHAPTER VIII . From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle . They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove ’s , for the little boy ’s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings . Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; _ they _ could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth . His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and “
23551	23552	23388	23389	a fool	1751	” “
23567	23987	23558	23558	I	0	” occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , Anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself . There must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain . They had no conversation together , no intercourse but what the commonest civility required . Once so much to each other ! Now nothing ! There _ had _ been a time , when of all the large party now filling the drawing - room at Uppercross , they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another . With the exception , perhaps , of Admiral and Mrs Croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ) , there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved . Now they were as strangers ; nay , worse than strangers , for they could never become acquainted . It was a perpetual estrangement . When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind . There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove ’s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying — “
24018	24119	24120	24120	Your	98	” Anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others . When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ) , and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded . “
24136	24137	24138	24138	You	98	” “
24189	24196	24230	24230	they	29	” The girls looked all amazement . “
24200	24204	24230	24230	they	29	” he continued , “
24271	24272	24230	24230	they	29	” “
24277	24282	24230	24230	they	29	” cried the Admiral , “
24355	24356	24357	24357	I	0	” “
24368	24375	24364	24364	I	0	” replied Captain Wentworth , seriously . “
24416	24417	24409	24409	I	0	” “
24455	24456	24447	24447	he	306	” “
24462	24466	24459	24460	Captain Wentworth	120	” cried Louisa , “
24491	24492	24493	24493	I	0	” “
24504	24510	24511	24511	I	0	” said he , smiling . “
24771	24801	24806	24806	I	0	” Anne ’s shudderings were to herself alone ; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror . “
24809	24824	24806	24806	I	0	” said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , “
24848	24856	24843	24843	Charles	101	” ( beckoning him to her ) , “
24876	24877	24872	24872	I	0	” “
24907	24908	24904	24905	Captain Wentworth	120	” “
24949	25043	24919	24919	he	120	” Charles , being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away . The girls were now hunting for the Laconia ; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non - commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had . “
25144	25145	25124	25124	I	0	” “
25153	25158	25151	25151	Sir	590	” said Mrs Musgrove , “
25188	25229	25179	25179	We	591	” Her feelings made her speak low ; and Captain Wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more . “
25233	25240	25179	25179	We	591	” whispered one of the girls ; “
25248	25249	25246	25246	Richard	120	” “
25254	25259	25260	25260	he	120	” continued Mrs Musgrove ; “
25312	25720	25296	25296	I	0	” There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth ’s face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove ’s kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent ’s feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove . It was no insignificant barrier , indeed . Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne ’s slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for . Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions . A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world . But , fair or not fair , there are unbecoming conjunctions , which reason will patronize in vain — which taste can not tolerate — which ridicule will seize . The Admiral , after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him , being called to order by his wife , now came up to Captain Wentworth , and without any observation of what he might be interrupting , thinking only of his own thoughts , began with — “
25753	25754	25756	25756	I	0	” “
25769	25817	25758	25758	I	0	” The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry . He defended himself ; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his , excepting for a ball , or a visit , which a few hours might comprehend . “
25825	25829	25823	25823	myself	0	” said he , “
25943	25951	25954	25954	Frederick	120	” This brought his sister upon him . “
26028	26038	26010	26010	I	0	” ( with a kind bow to Anne ) , “
26061	26062	26055	26055	they	614	” “
26068	26073	26055	26055	they	614	” replied her brother . “
26089	26090	26094	26094	yourself	0	” “
26129	26130	26126	26126	yours	0	” “

26197	26198	26199	26199	I	0	” “
26228	26229	26230	26230	My	0	” “
26274	26275	26276	26276	My	0	” “
26296	26297	26279	26279	you	120	” “
26339	26340	26325	26325	We	627	” “
26346	26351	26325	26325	We	627	” said the Admiral , “
26417	26418	26422	26422	we	627	” “
26425	26426	26422	26422	we	627	” “
26432	26437	26428	26428	I	0	” cried Captain Wentworth . “
26494	26502	26475	26475	they	642	” He got up and moved away . “
26514	26522	26526	26526	ma’am	644	” said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft . “
26615	26646	26600	26600	We	649	” Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent ; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life . “
26655	26660	26648	26648	I	0	” pursued Mrs Croft , “
26905	26906	26897	26897	I	0	” “
26930	26938	26927	26928	Mrs Croft	115	” was Mrs Musgrove ’s hearty answer . “
26988	27294	26956	26956	I	0	” The evening ended with dancing . On its being proposed , Anne offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved . It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth . She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do . The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . _ Once _ she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and _ once _ she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ? The answer was , “
27320	27390	27313	27313	She	661	” Once , too , he spoke to her . She had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of . Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness — “
27403	28049	27400	27400	your	661	” and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches . His cold politeness , his ceremonious grace , were worse than anything . CHAPTER IX . Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral ’s fraternal kindness as of his wife ’s . He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off . There was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of Edward ’s wife upon credit a little longer . It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day . The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment . Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth ’s introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father ’s house , only two miles from Uppercross . A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing Captain Wentworth . Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters . They had each had money , but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence . Mr Hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove ’s ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ’ inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest . The two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins . Charles ’s attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation . “
28064	28314	28318	28320	a pleasanter man	664	him,”—and Henrietta _ did _ seem to like him . Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten . Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne ’s observation reached . Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not _ now _ , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ’ company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to _ which _ was the one liked best . Charles gave it for Louisa , Mary for Henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . Charles “
28414	28415	28417	28417	my	0	” “
28422	28426	28417	28417	my	0	” replied Mary . “
28510	28575	28576	28576	You	670	” It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed — very sad for herself and her children . “
28579	28583	28576	28576	You	670	” said she , “
28686	28725	28681	28682	Miss Musgrove	126	” Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , Charles Hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself . “
28734	28740	28727	28727	you	678	” was therefore his answer . “
28968	28969	28970	28970	Charles	100	” “
28977	28993	28970	28970	Charles	100	” cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , “
29157	29726	29147	29147	you	689	” A dinner at Mr Musgrove ’s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles . She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening . As to Captain Wentworth ’s views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta . Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good - humoured wife . With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alteration could not be understood too soon . Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin ’s behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause . He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley ’s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas ! the zeal of the business was gone by . Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley : she was at a window , looking out for Captain Wentworth ; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation . “
29786	29863	29864	29864	I	0	” One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which Anne had not been present , Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid Charles , who was lying on the sofa . The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , “
29883	29902	29873	29874	Mrs Musgrove	122	” before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave . “
29924	29989	29920	29920	I	0	” had been Anne ’s reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself . He continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , “
29998	30108	29990	29990	I	0	” was silent . She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . She hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy — Charles Hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne . She only attempted to say , “
30127	30341	30342	30342	Walter	94	” Captain Wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window . Another minute brought another addition . The younger boy , a remarkable stout , forward child , of two years old , having got the door opened for him by some one without , made his determined appearance among them , and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on , and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away . There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off . She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly . “
30344	30348	30342	30342	Walter	94	” said she , “
30366	30367	30368	30368	Walter	94	” “
30370	30375	30368	30368	Walter	94	” cried Charles Hayter , “
30405	30695	30696	30696	You	701	” But not a bit did Walter stir . In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it . Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him . She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings . His kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room . She could not stay . It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four — they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it . It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth . She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth ’s interference , “
30716	31306	30707	30707	I	0	” and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself . But neither Charles Hayter ’s feelings , nor anybody ’s feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her . CHAPTER X. Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur . Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either . They were more in love with him ; yet there it was not love . It was a little fever of admiration ; but it might , probably must , end in love with some . Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted , and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them . Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about , and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to . She did not attribute guile to any . It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning . There was no triumph , no pitiful triumph in his manner . He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter . He was only wrong in accepting the attentions ( for accepting must be the word ) of two young women at once . After a short struggle , however , Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field . Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him , Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death . It was Mary ’s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow . Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise . One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house . It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a _ long _ walk , and , therefore , concluded Mary could not like to go with them ; and when Mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , “
31329	31447	31448	31448	I	0	” Anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient . She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ’ much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own . “
31464	31474	31456	31456	I	0	” said Mary , as she went up stairs . “
31522	31902	31505	31505	people	421	” Just as they were setting off , the gentlemen returned . They had taken out a young dog , who had spoilt their sport , and sent them back early . Their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure . Could Anne have foreseen such a junction , she would have staid at home ; but , from some feelings of interest and curiosity , she fancied now that it was too late to retract , and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves , who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance . Anne ’s object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister . Her _ pleasure _ in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day , from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves , and withered hedges , and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn , that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness , that season which had drawn from every poet , worthy of being read , some attempt at description , or some lines of feeling . She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of Captain Wentworth ’s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable . It was mere lively chat , such as any young persons , on an intimate footing , might fall into . He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta . Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister . This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of Louisa ’s which struck her . After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , Captain Wentworth added : — “
31985	31986	31975	31975	she	696	” “
31999	32003	31989	31989	You	717	” cried Louisa , “
32062	32069	32071	32071	you	0	” It was spoken with enthusiasm . “
32073	32082	32071	32071	you	0	” cried he , catching the same tone ; “
32087	32174	32083	32083	I	0	” And there was silence between them for a little while . Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again . The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . She roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , “
32185	32341	32083	32083	I	0	” But nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her . Winthrop , however , or its environs — for young men are , sometimes to be met with , strolling about near home — was their destination ; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures , where the ploughs at work , and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence , and meaning to have spring again , they gained the summit of the most considerable hill , which parted Uppercross and Winthrop , and soon commanded a full view of the latter , at the foot of the hill on the other side . Winthrop , without beauty and without dignity , was stretched before them ; an indifferent house , standing low , and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm - yard . Mary exclaimed , “
32372	32404	32367	32367	I	0	” Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but “
32407	32413	32367	32367	I	0	” said Charles Musgrove , and “
32418	32522	32367	32367	I	0	” cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly . Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , “
32548	32669	32367	32367	I	0	” and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not . After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between Charles and his two sisters , that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill . Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth — “
32698	33019	32685	32685	I	0	” She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of . The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer ; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . She turned through the same gate , but could not see them . Anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other . Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on till she overtook her . Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . They were speaking as they drew near . Louisa ’s voice was the first distinguished . She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech . What Anne first heard was — “
33146	33147	33133	33133	she	125	” “
33159	33160	33161	33161	She	125	” “
33173	33174	33161	33161	She	125	” “
33401	33413	33371	33371	You	730	” said he , catching one down from an upper bough , “
33450	33458	33463	33463	his	728	” he continued , with playful solemnity , “
33491	33498	33511	33511	they	737	” Then returning to his former earnest tone—“My
33540	33629	33530	33530	she	126	” He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth ! She could imagine what Louisa was feeling . For herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen . While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again . “
33640	33644	33646	33646	she	99	” said she ; “
33696	33707	33690	33690	he	100	” After a moment ’s pause , Captain Wentworth said — “
33716	33717	33712	33712	she	99	” “
33724	33725	33712	33712	she	99	” “
33731	33732	33733	33733	I	0	” “
33826	34554	33819	33819	she	99	” The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more . Her own emotions still kept her fixed . She had much to recover from , before she could move . The listener ’s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import . She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation . As soon as she could , she went after Mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together . Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them . The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman ’s side , and a relenting on the lady ’s , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;—Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . In a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance , Anne necessarily belonged . She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles ’s other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife . Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all . This long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be Admiral Croft ’s gig . He and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home . Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in , they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired ; it would save her a full mile , and they were going through Uppercross . The invitation was general , and generally declined . The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and Mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise . The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . The something might be guessed by its effects . “
34567	34572	34555	34556	Miss Elliot	98	” cried Mrs Croft . “
34617	34939	34940	34940	Frederick	151	” Anne was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed . The Admiral ’s kind urgency came in support of his wife ’s ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and Captain Wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage . Yes ; he had done it . She was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest . She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent . This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before . She understood him . He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling . Though condemning her for the past , and considering it with high and unjust resentment , though perfectly careless of her , and though becoming attached to another , still he could not see her suffer , without the desire of giving her relief . It was a remainder of former sentiment ; it was an impulse of pure , though unacknowledged friendship ; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart , which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain , that she knew not which prevailed . Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . They had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said . She then found them talking of “
34942	34943	34940	34940	Frederick	151	” “
34959	34964	34957	34957	Sophy	136	” said the Admiral ; “
35063	35064	35065	35065	We	750	” “
35076	35083	35065	35065	We	750	” replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; “
35123	35124	35111	35111	I	0	” “
35208	35209	35214	35215	unaffected girls	758	” “
35219	35253	35214	35215	unaffected girls	758	” said Mrs Croft , in a tone of calmer praise , such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ; “
35283	37144	35271	35271	Admiral	1982	” But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung - cart ; and Anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage . CHAPTER XI . The time now approached for Lady Russell ’s return : the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it . It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families . This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell . She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere . They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were Lady Russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little . These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough . Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months ’ visit there , but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for . The conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined . Captain Wentworth , after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away . A letter from his friend , Captain Harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of Captain Harville ’s being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other . Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and Captain Wentworth ’s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme . He had been there for four - and - twenty hours . His acquittal was complete , his friendship warmly honoured , a lively interest excited for his friend , and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party , that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves , and a project for going thither was the consequence . The young people were all wild to see Lyme . Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go — Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth . The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day ’s dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove ’s coach containing the four ladies , and Charles ’s curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea . They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme , as a public place , might offer . The rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the Cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the Cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger ’s eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme , to make him wish to know it better . The scenes in its neighbourhood , Charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme ; and , above all , Pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far - famed Isle of Wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of Lyme understood . The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea - shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the Cobb , equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth ’s account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the Harvilles settled . Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the Cobb . They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them . Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . He had been engaged to Captain Harville ’s sister , and was now mourning her loss . They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion . Fortune came , his prize - money as lieutenant being great ; promotion , too , came at _ last ; _ but Fanny Harville did not live to know it . She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea . Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely . Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of Lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick ’s state of mind . The sympathy and good - will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great . “
37148	37164	37165	37165	he	764	” said Anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , “
37222	37521	37211	37211	He	764	” They all met , and were introduced . Captain Harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than Captain Wentworth . Captain Benwick looked , and was , the youngest of the three , and , compared with either of them , a little man . He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation . Captain Harville , though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging . Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . The dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them . There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this , and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon , so unlike the usual style of give - and - take invitations , and dinners of formality and display , that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother - officers . “
37530	37998	37211	37211	He	764	” was her thought ; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness . On quitting the Cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many . Anne had a moment ’s astonishment on the subject herself ; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville , to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging - house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected . The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification . Captain Harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of Captain Benwick . His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise ; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within . He drew , he varnished , he carpentered , he glued ; he made toys for the children ; he fashioned new netting - needles and pins with improvements ; and if everything else was done , sat down to his large fishing - net at one corner of the room . Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and Louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved . They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being “
38005	38008	37211	37211	He	764	” and the “
38014	38017	37211	37211	He	764	” and the “
38023	38936	37211	37211	He	764	” had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn . Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth ’s company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ) , was become a mere nothing . The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . He ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general . While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne ’s lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him . He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening ’s indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether _ Marmion _ or _ The Lady of the Lake _ were to be preferred , and how ranked the _ Giaour _ and _ The Bride of Abydos ; _ and moreover , how the _ Giaour _ was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them . When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination . CHAPTER XII . Anne and Henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast . They went to the sands , to watch the flowing of the tide , which a fine south - easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted . They praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh - feeling breeze — and were silent ; till Henrietta suddenly began again with — “
39337	39457	39458	39458	I	0	” Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ? She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ’s being married . “
39461	39472	39458	39458	I	0	” said Henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , “
39560	39863	39864	39865	That man	789	” Anne was amused by Henrietta ’s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta ’s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them . They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready ; but Louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop , invited them all to go back with her into the town . They were all at her disposal . When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way . They ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , Anne ’s face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of . She was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced . It was evident that the gentleman , ( completely a gentleman in manner ) admired her exceedingly . Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it . He gave her a momentary glance , a glance of brightness , which seemed to say , “
39886	40219	39882	39883	Anne Elliot	98	” After attending Louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and Anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining - room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment . She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves , and determined that a well - looking groom , who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back , should be his servant . Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea . It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman ’s looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners . He seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person . Anne felt that she should like to know who he was . They had nearly done breakfast , when the sound of a carriage , ( almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme ) drew half the party to the window . It was a gentleman ’s carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable - yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away . It was driven by a servant in mourning . The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused Anne ’s curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off . “
40222	40237	39882	39883	Anne Elliot	98	” cried Captain Wentworth , instantly , and with half a glance at Anne , “
40246	40285	40240	40244	the very man we passed	791	” The Miss Musgroves agreed to it ; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could , they returned to the breakfast table . The waiter came into the room soon afterwards . “
40288	40295	40240	40244	the very man we passed	791	” said Captain Wentworth , immediately , “
40311	40312	40297	40297	you	793	” “
40364	40365	40366	40366	Elliot	98	” “
40368	40400	40366	40366	Elliot	98	” Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . “
40404	40408	40366	40366	Elliot	98	” cried Mary ; “
40480	40486	40478	40478	sir	590	” turning to the waiter , “
40505	40506	40511	40511	he	95	” “
40538	40539	40520	40520	he	95	” “
40545	40552	40520	40520	he	95	” cried Mary in an ecstasy , “
40749	40750	40740	40740	one	1726	” “
40759	40764	40740	40740	one	1726	” said Captain Wentworth , “
40786	40959	40774	40774	Providence	121	” When she could command Mary ’s attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable . At the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense . She would not , upon any account , mention her having met with him the second time ; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk , but she would have felt quite ill - used by Anne ’s having actually run against him in the passage , and received his very polite excuses , while she had never been near him at all ; no , that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret . “
40963	40967	40968	40968	you	820	” said Mary , “
41001	41263	40984	40984	I	0	” Anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; Elizabeth ’s particular share in it she suspected ; and that Mr Elliot ’s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt . Mary never wrote to Bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne . Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme . They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one , and in the meanwhile were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could . Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street . Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of Captain Benwick , she had Captain Harville by her side . “
41267	41275	40984	40984	I	0	” said he , speaking rather low , “
41328	41329	41323	41323	We	824	” “
41332	41336	41323	41323	We	824	” said Anne , “
41389	41390	41386	41386	I	0	” “
41396	41403	41386	41386	I	0	” ( with a deep sigh ) “
41407	41408	41386	41386	I	0	” “
41420	41421	41386	41386	I	0	” “
41507	41515	41504	41506	that good fellow	831	” ( pointing to Captain Wentworth ) . “
41614	41864	41604	41605	Miss Elliot	98	” Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different . Mrs Harville ’s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves . By all their calculations there was just time for this ; but as they drew near the Cobb , there was such a general wish to walk along it once more , all were so inclined , and Louisa soon grew so determined , that the difference of a quarter of an hour , it was found , would be no difference at all ; so with all the kind leave - taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door , and still accompanied by Captain Benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb . Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her . Lord Byron ’s “
41868	42059	42060	42060	I	0	” could not fail of being brought forward by their present view , and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible . It was soon drawn , perforce another way . There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies , and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower , and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting Louisa ; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth . In all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her . The hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however . She was safely down , and instantly , to show her enjoyment , ran up the steps to be jumped down again . He advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , “
42066	42171	42063	42063	I	0	” he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb , and was taken up lifeless ! There was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . The horror of the moment to all who stood around ! Captain Wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence . “
42180	42241	42176	42176	she	838	” screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them . “
42250	42277	42176	42176	she	838	” were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth , in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone . “
42286	42290	42176	42176	she	838	” cried Anne , “
42331	42398	42402	42403	her father	1747	” Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ; while Captain Wentworth , staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony — “
42407	42408	42409	42410	A surgeon	843	” “
42412	42431	42435	42436	a surgeon	843	” said Anne . He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only—“True
42440	42450	42435	42436	a surgeon	843	” was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested — “
42473	42678	42463	42463	He	159	” Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother ’s care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity . As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : Captain Wentworth , Anne , or Charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over Louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him for help which he could not give . Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth . Both seemed to look to her for directions . “
42683	42687	42681	42681	Anne	98	” cried Charles , “
42708	42719	42681	42681	Anne	98	” Captain Wentworth ’s eyes were also turned towards her . “
42743	42744	42732	42732	I	0	” “
42753	42768	42732	42732	I	0	” repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something . “
42783	43292	42775	42775	Musgrove	101	” By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady , nay , two dead young ladies , for it proved twice as fine as the first report . To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along . They were not off the Cobb , before the Harvilles met them . Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong ; and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot . Shocked as Captain Harville was , he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful ; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done . She must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon ’s arrival there . They would not listen to scruples : he was obeyed ; they were all beneath his roof ; and while Louisa , under Mrs Harville ’s direction , was conveyed up stairs , and given possession of her own bed , assistance , cordials , restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them . Louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness . This had been a proof of life , however , of service to her sister ; and Henrietta , though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa , was kept , by the agitation of hope and fear , from a return of her own insensibility . Mary , too , was growing calmer . The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible . They were sick with horror , while he examined ; but he was not hopeless . The head had received a severe contusion , but he had seen greater injuries recovered from : he was by no means hopeless ; he spoke cheerfully . That he did not regard it as a desperate case , that he did not say a few hours must end it , was at first felt , beyond the hope of most ; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve , the rejoicing , deep and silent , after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered , may be conceived . The tone , the look , with which “
43296	43510	42775	42775	Musgrove	101	” was uttered by Captain Wentworth , Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them . Louisa ’s limbs had escaped . There was no injury but to the head . It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done , as to their general situation . They were now able to speak to each other and consult . That Louisa must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt . Her removal was impossible . The Harvilles silenced all scruples ; and , as much as they could , all gratitude . They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect . Captain Benwick must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled . They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by “
43527	43669	42775	42775	Musgrove	101	” they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville ’s care entirely . Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse , and her nursery - maid , who had lived with her long , and gone about with her everywhere , was just such another . Between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night . And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible . Charles , Henrietta , and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror . “
43725	43756	43757	43757	We	856	” At first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , Captain Wentworth , exerting himself , said — “
43795	43979	43786	43786	Musgrove	122	” Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would . So far it was decided ; and Henrietta at first declared the same . She , however , was soon persuaded to think differently . The usefulness of her staying ! She who had not been able to remain in Louisa ’s room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless ! She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till , touched by the thought of her father and mother , she gave it up ; she consented , she was anxious to be at home . The plan had reached this point , when Anne , coming quietly down from Louisa ’s room , could not but hear what followed , for the parlour door was open . “
43987	43992	43985	43985	Musgrove	126	” cried Captain Wentworth , “
44066	44098	44056	44057	no one	1950	” She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of . The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared . “
44114	44163	44107	44107	you	126	” cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past . She coloured deeply , and he recollected himself and moved away . She expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain . “
44204	44992	44197	44198	Mrs Harville	141	” One thing more , and all seemed arranged . Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and Captain Wentworth proposed , and Charles Musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave Mr Musgrove ’s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa ’s night . Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies . When the plan was made known to Mary , however , there was an end of all peace in it . She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne ; Anne , who was nothing to Louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in Henrietta ’s stead ! Why was not she to be as useful as Anne ? And to go home without Charles , too , without her husband ! No , it was too unkind . And in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable . Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment ’s recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta ’s schemes for Dr Shirley ’s leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapped up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance . Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa . She endeavoured to be composed , and to be just . Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry , she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend . In the meanwhile she was in the carriage . He had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to Anne , she quitted Lyme . How the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee . It was all quite natural , however . He was devoted to Henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits . In general , his voice and manner were studiously calm . To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle . Once only , when she had been grieving over the last ill - judged , ill - fated walk to the Cobb , bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of , he burst forth , as if wholly overcome — “
45005	45009	45010	45011	Oh God	142	” he cried . “
45045	45263	45042	45043	sweet Louisa	126	” Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits . She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character . They got on fast . Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon . Their actual speed , heightened by some dread of the conclusion , made the road appear but half as long as on the day before . It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , Henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth . In a low , cautious voice , he said : — “
45325	45619	45620	45620	She	871	” She did : he was satisfied , and said no more . But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen . When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off . ( End of volume one . ) CHAPTER XIII . The remainder of Anne ’s time at Uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the Mansion House ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in Mr and Mrs Musgrove ’s distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties . They had an early account from Lyme the next morning . Louisa was much the same . No symptoms worse than before had appeared . Charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account . He was tolerably cheerful . A speedy cure must not be hoped , but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted . In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville ’s exertions as a nurse . “
45707	45994	45698	45699	Mrs Harville	141	” Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent . It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon . A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon . They were indebted , the next day , to Charles Hayter , for all the minute knowledge of Louisa , which it was so essential to obtain every twenty - four hours . He made it his business to go to Lyme , and his account was still encouraging . The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth ’s appearing fixed in Lyme . Anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded . “
46010	47168	47169	47169	I	0	” And so much was said in this way , that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once . She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved . They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again . More than former happiness would be restored . There could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery . A few months hence , and the room now so deserted , occupied but by her silent , pensive self , might be filled again with all that was happy and gay , all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike Anne Elliot ! An hour ’s complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell ’s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart . Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious . It stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear . She left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been . Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell ’s house in September . It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from . Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress . There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell ’s joy in meeting her . She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross . But happily , either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or Lady Russell fancied her so ; and Anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty . When they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change . The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest . She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath . Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father ’s house in Camden Place , or her own sister ’s intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her . There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject . They must speak of the accident at Lyme . Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth ’s name must be mentioned by both . Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell . She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell ’s eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa . When this was told , his name distressed her no longer . Lady Russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove . The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa . At the end of that period , Lady Russell ’s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , “
47211	47233	47234	47234	I	0	” Anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing — “
47272	47423	47265	47265	I	0	” She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners ’ . These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments . In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself , “
47459	47777	47454	47454	Strangers	2282	” No , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave . Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention . The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot ’s not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove ’s recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter ! The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming — “
47828	47860	47813	47814	Miss Elliot	98	” Admiral Croft ’s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell , but they delighted Anne . His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible . “
47871	47882	47813	47814	Miss Elliot	98	” said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , “
47933	47934	47938	47938	Sir	590	” “
47947	47948	47940	47940	I	0	” “
47991	47997	47998	47998	you	98	” ( checking himself ) , “
48071	48086	48050	48050	you	98	” Anne , finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully . “
48095	48105	48087	48087	We	890	” continued the Admiral , after thinking a moment . “
48264	48272	48257	48257	I	0	” ( looking with serious reflection ) , “
48353	48391	48411	48412	Mrs Croft	115	” Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say — “
48522	49099	48514	48514	He	910	” Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend . Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject . CHAPTER XIV . Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove ’s going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together . Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville ’s children away as much as she could , every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles , while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable . Mary had had her evils ; but upon the whole , as was evident by her staying so long , she had found more to enjoy than to suffer . Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick . Mary ’s face was clouded directly . Charles laughed . “
49266	49273	49263	49264	Captain Benwick	159	” Charles laughed again and said , “
49292	49299	49289	49289	your	99	” ( turning to Anne ) . “
49364	49445	49448	49448	he	159	” But Mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed . Anne ’s good - will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries . “
49453	49457	49448	49448	he	159	” cried Charles , “
49462	49467	49468	49468	I	0	” Mary interrupted him . “
49500	49501	49492	49492	he	159	” “
49504	49508	49492	49492	he	159	” admitted Charles , “
49660	49661	49655	49656	Miss Elliot	98	” “
49667	49673	49680	49680	his	159	” cried Mary , warmly , “
49718	49719	49712	49712	you	99	” “
49729	49736	49726	49726	I	0	” said Lady Russell , smiling . “
49755	49759	49748	49748	I	0	” said Charles . “
49883	49884	49880	49881	Lady Russell	106	” “
49897	49905	49880	49881	Lady Russell	106	” was Lady Russell ’s kind answer . “
49915	49919	49922	49922	he	159	” said Mary , “
49940	49941	49933	49933	him	159	” “
49961	49962	49958	49959	Captain Benwick	159	” “
50035	50036	50029	50029	you	99	” “
50043	50047	50041	50041	Mary	99	” said Anne . “
50080	50081	50058	50058	she	106	” “
50088	50092	50086	50086	Anne	98	” said Charles . “
50123	50124	50128	50128	he	159	” “
50131	50137	50138	50138	He	159	” exclaimed Mary , tauntingly . “
50178	50186	50172	50173	Lady Russell	106	” Lady Russell could not help laughing . “
50191	50195	50172	50173	Lady Russell	106	” said she , “
50281	50282	50272	50272	I	0	” “
50295	50322	50289	50289	I	0	” Lady Russell began talking of something else . Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing , Mr Elliot so extraordinarily . “
50328	50333	50325	50326	a man	306	” said Lady Russell , “
50368	51133	51134	51134	I	0	” This decision checked Mary ’s eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance . With regard to Captain Wentworth , though Anne hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient . His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected . As Louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week . He had not seen Louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger . He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father ’s grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however . He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week ’s indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville ’s little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme . Henrietta remained with Louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters . Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once , when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again . Though neither Henrietta , nor Louisa , nor Charles Hayter , nor Captain Wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in . Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain . It was a fine family - piece . Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa ’s illness must have so greatly shaken . But Mrs Musgrove , who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home . Louisa was now recovering apace . Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again . The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross , whenever she returned . Captain Wentworth was gone , for the present , to see his brother in Shropshire . “
51143	51158	51136	51136	I	0	” said Lady Russell , as soon as they were reseated in the carriage , “
51169	51533	51136	51136	I	0	” Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters ; and sounds are quite innoxious , or most distressing , by their sort rather than their quantity . When Lady Russell not long afterwards , was entering Bath on a wet afternoon , and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin - men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint . No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like Mrs Musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness . Anne did not share these feelings . She persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for Bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ? And looked back , with fond regret , to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch . Elizabeth ’s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest . Mr Elliot was in Bath . He had called in Camden Place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive . If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect . This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being “
51544	51704	51136	51136	I	0	” She had a great wish to see him . If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath . She was put down in Camden Place ; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings , in Rivers Street . CHAPTER XV . Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction . Anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , “
51714	53210	53220	53221	Mr Elliot	95	” A degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good . Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness . Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage . Mrs Clay was very pleasant , and very smiling , but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course . Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for . They were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes . They had no inclination to listen to her . After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood , which Anne could not pay , they had only a few faint enquiries to make , before the talk must be all their own . Uppercross excited no interest , Kellynch very little : it was all Bath . They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect . Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place ; their drawing - rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of , and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting - up , or the taste of the furniture . Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after . Everybody was wanting to visit them . They had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing . Here were funds of enjoyment . Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy ? She might not wonder , but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change , should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder , should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town ; and she must sigh , and smile , and wonder too , as Elizabeth threw open the folding - doors and walked with exultation from one drawing - room to the other , boasting of their space ; at the possibility of that woman , who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall , finding extent to be proud of between two walls , perhaps thirty feet asunder . But this was not all which they had to make them happy . They had Mr Elliot too . Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot . He was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him . He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter ’s being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established . They had not a fault to find in him . He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side . It had originated in misapprehension entirely . He had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent . Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant . He , who had ever boasted of being an Elliot , and whose feelings , as to connection , were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day . He was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it . He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject . The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story . She was certainly not a woman of family , but well educated , accomplished , rich , and excessively in love with his friend . There had been the charm . She had sought him . Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . Here was a great deal to soften the business . A very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him ! Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation . Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place . Anne listened , but without quite understanding it . Allowances , large allowances , she knew , must be made for the ideas of those who spoke . She heard it all under embellishment . All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . Still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in Mr Elliot ’s wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them . In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance . In all probability he was already the richer of the two , and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title . A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth ’s sake . There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself . How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot ’s frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to . “
53235	53288	53310	53310	he	95	” They could not listen to her description of him . They were describing him themselves ; Sir Walter especially . He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , “
53350	53355	53327	53328	Mr Elliot	95	” but Sir Walter had “
53402	53420	53391	53391	he	95	” Mr Elliot , and his friends in Marlborough Buildings , were talked of the whole evening . “
53442	53476	53477	53480	a most charming woman	947	” and there was a Mrs Wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as “
53491	53524	53529	53529	her	947	” and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted . Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis ; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman , beautiful . “
53792	53837	53789	53790	Colonel Wallis	177	” Modest Sir Walter ! He was not allowed to escape , however . His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis ’s companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired . “
53843	53856	53789	53790	Colonel Wallis	177	” said Sir Walter , in the height of his good humour . “
53879	53880	53789	53790	Colonel Wallis	177	” “
53908	53909	53894	53894	she	99	” “
53939	53975	53929	53929	I	0	” Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything . “
54043	54115	54116	54116	he	95	” Mrs Clay was right . With all the state which a butler and foot - boy could give , Mr Elliot was ushered into the room . It was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress . Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but “
54139	54175	54116	54116	he	95	” & c. & c. ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; “
54189	54595	54116	54116	he	95	” ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was . He looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened ! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship , alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . He was quite as good - looking as he had appeared at Lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person ’s manners . They were not the same , but they were , perhaps , equally good . He sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much . There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man . Ten minutes were enough to certify that . His tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind . As soon as he could , he began to talk to her of Lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her . She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme . His regret increased as he listened . He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself . If he had but asked who the party were ! The name of Musgrove would have told him enough . “
54640	54641	54116	54116	he	95	” “
54655	54659	54603	54603	him	970	” said he , “
54716	54785	55084	55084	you	977	” But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme . His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place . Having alluded to “
54789	54877	55084	55084	you	977	” he must hear the whole . When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt . She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it . He staid an hour with them . The elegant little clock on the mantel - piece had struck “
54884	55045	55084	55084	you	977	” and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long . Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well ! CHAPTER XVI . There was one point which Anne , on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot ’s being in love with Elizabeth , which was , her father ’s not being in love with Mrs Clay ; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours . On going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady ’s side of meaning to leave them . She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said , that “
55061	55072	55052	55052	she	98	” for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , “
55100	55113	55090	55090	She	98	” and she was in full time to hear her father say , “
55183	55285	55310	55310	she	980	” He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself . Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay . In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her “
55318	55319	55310	55310	she	980	” “
55324	55325	55310	55310	she	980	” “
55329	55333	55326	55327	Merely Gowland	68	” he supposed . “
55340	55341	55310	55310	she	980	” “
55350	55354	55310	55310	she	980	” and added , “
55423	55639	55413	55413	You	982	” If Elizabeth could but have heard this ! Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened . But everything must take its chance . The evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if Elizabeth were also to marry . As for herself , she might always command a home with Lady Russell . Lady Russell ’s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in Camden Place . The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed . As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , “
55646	56009	56010	56010	Elizabeth	96	” and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . Everything united in him ; good understanding , correct opinions , knowledge of the world , and a warm heart . He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour , without pride or weakness ; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune , without display ; he judged for himself in everything essential , without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum . He was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess . She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage . Colonel Wallis said it , and Lady Russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice . Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay . It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot ’s great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell ’s view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth . Anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention “
56012	56025	56010	56010	Elizabeth	96	” Lady Russell listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply:—“Elizabeth
56034	56083	56084	56085	Miss Elliot	98	” It was a reference to the future , which Anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to . She could determine nothing at present . In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as “
56087	56481	56084	56085	Miss Elliot	98	” that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible . Mr Elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months . A little delay on his side might be very excusable . In fact , Anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved . However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself . They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person ’s look also . They did not always think alike . His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister ’s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and her daughter , the Honourable Miss Carteret ; and all the comfort of No . — , Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in Anne ’s opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly . Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed . She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for “
56490	56491	56482	56483	our cousins	984	” “
56498	56691	56495	56496	the Dalrymples	183	” sounded in her ears all day long . Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter ’s at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch . No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland . The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself , no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed . How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant . “
56778	56843	56844	56844	She	185	” Sir Walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin . Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess . “
56858	56903	56844	56844	She	185	” The toils of the business were over , the sweets began . They visited in Laura Place , they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and the Honourable Miss Carteret , to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and “
56908	56917	56844	56844	She	185	Place,”—“Our cousin , Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , ”
56975	56980	56982	56982	she	185	“ a charming woman , ”
57035	57043	57027	57027	she	106	“ it was an acquaintance worth having ; ”
57101	57138	57096	57096	Anne	98	“ My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . ”
57139	57144	57146	57146	he	95	“ You are mistaken , ”
57149	57233	57146	57146	he	95	“ that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied . She is fastidious . My dear cousin ”
57241	57359	57146	57146	he	95	“ you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ? Will it make you happy ? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ? You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . ”
57360	57363	57365	57365	Anne	98	“ Yes , ”
57367	57381	57384	57384	herself	98	“ we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! ”
57396	57417	57393	57393	she	98	“ I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose ”
57421	57466	57393	57393	she	98	“ I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . ”
57467	57523	57146	57146	he	95	“ Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance . ”
57524	57527	57529	57529	Anne	98	“ Well , ”
57531	57550	57529	57529	Anne	98	“ I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place . ”
57551	57557	57559	57559	he	997	“ I love your indignation , ”
57561	57660	57662	57662	he	997	“ it is very natural . But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot . You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . In one point , I am sure , my dear cousin , ”
57678	57725	57726	57726	He	997	“ in one point , I am sure , we must feel alike . We must feel that every addition to your father ’s society , among his equals or superiors , may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him . ”
59041	59045	59047	59048	Mrs Smith	187	“ And she , ”
59050	59365	59047	59048	Mrs Smith	187	“ besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . She always takes the right time for applying . Everybody ’s heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . She is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ‘ the best education in the world , ’ know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour ’s leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one ’s species better . One likes to hear what is going on , to be _ au fait _ as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat . ”
59379	59500	59366	59366	Anne	98	“ I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . ”
59501	59504	59506	59507	Mrs Smith	187	“ Yes , ”
59511	59592	59506	59507	Mrs Smith	187	“ sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of . There is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately ”
59599	59616	59506	59507	Mrs Smith	187	“ there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . ”
59683	59783	59670	59670	she	187	“ I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now . ”

59964	59968	59970	59970	he	94	“ Westgate Buildings ! ”
59972	60108	59970	59970	he	94	“ and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ? A Mrs Smith . A widow Mrs Smith ; and who was her husband ? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . And what is her attraction ? That she is old and sickly . Upon my word , Miss Anne Elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste ! Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you . But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day . What is her age ? Forty ? ”
60109	60178	59955	59955	Elizabeth	96	“ No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself . She goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged . ”
60179	60190	60192	60192	Elizabeth	96	“ But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ? ”
60194	60203	60205	60205	Anne	98	“ She sees nothing to blame in it , ”
60207	60229	60205	60205	Anne	98	“ on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith . ”
60230	60250	60252	60253	Sir Walter	94	“ Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement , ”
60255	60372	60252	60253	Sir Walter	94	“ Sir Henry Russell ’s widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith ! Such a name ! ”
60892	60905	60907	60908	Lady Russell	106	“ I am no match - maker , as you well know , ”
60910	60986	60907	60908	Lady Russell	106	“ being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one . ”
60987	61006	61008	61008	Anne	98	“ Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , ”
61010	61017	61008	61008	Anne	98	“ but we should not suit . ”
61030	61165	61018	61019	Lady Russell	106	“ I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother ’s place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother ’s self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! ”
61228	61231	61264	61265	Lady Russell	106	“ Lady Elliot ”
61329	61332	61326	61326	Kellynch	110	“ Lady Elliot ”
62018	62023	62025	62026	Sir Walter	94	“ What is this ? ”
62028	62048	62025	62026	Sir Walter	94	“ The Crofts have arrived in Bath ? The Crofts who rent Kellynch ? What have they brought you ? ”
62049	62058	61994	61995	The Crofts	119	“ A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir . ”
62059	62095	62096	62096	Anne	98	“ Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant . ”

62709	62712	62706	62706	Yours	1119	“ MARY M——. “
62771	62793	62794	62794	I	0	” So ended the first part , which had been afterwards put into an envelope , containing nearly as much more . “
63285	63411	63282	63283	the Hayters	144	” Mary need not have feared her sister ’s being in any degree prepared for the news . She had never in her life been more astonished . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! It was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment . Happily for her , they were not many . Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . “
63416	63427	63414	63414	Mary	193	” said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer , “
63437	63438	63439	63439	They	119	” “
63454	63455	63447	63447	He	1882	” “

63478	63482	63483	63483	I	0	” asked Elizabeth . “
63521	63522	63523	63523	I	0	” “
63526	63532	63523	63523	I	0	” said Sir Walter coolly , “
63564	63565	63549	63549	Elizabeth	96	” “
63666	64759	63659	63660	The Crofts	119	” This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth ’s share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it . Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her . She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . Their minds most dissimilar ! Where could have been the attraction ? The answer soon presented itself . It had been in situation . They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta ’s coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable . That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself . She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . He had an affectionate heart . He must love somebody . She saw no reason against their being happy . Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike . He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so . The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate . The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth ’s merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne ’s heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free . She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . They were too much like joy , senseless joy ! She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned , and Captain Benwick , too , without even half a smile . The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter ’s satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him . The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure . They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good . Anne saw them wherever she went . Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral ’s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft ’s arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend ’s carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral . He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour . “
64904	64910	64911	64911	I	0	” ( laughing heartily ) ; “
64923	64929	64959	64959	I	0	” ( turning away ) , “
64955	64956	64959	64959	I	0	” “

65056	65073	65048	65048	Lord	1167	” taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion . “
65087	65088	65075	65075	you	1151	” “
65424	65519	65537	65537	you	1188	” When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way . As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began — “
65593	65618	65619	65619	Louisa	126	” Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of “
65621	65622	65619	65619	Louisa	126	” “
65846	65847	65843	65844	James Benwick	199	” “
65860	65861	65857	65858	Captain Benwick	159	” “
65890	65891	65892	65892	I	0	” “
65902	65906	65896	65900	a very pleasing young man	1198	” said Anne , “
65917	65918	65896	65900	a very pleasing young man	1198	” “
66014	66015	66017	66017	you	1201	” “
66055	66056	66063	66065	the best judges	1206	” “
66111	66167	66168	66168	I	0	” Anne was caught . She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick ’s manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , “
66180	66188	66168	66168	I	0	” but the Admiral interrupted her with — “
66257	66273	66274	66274	I	0	” This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , “
66356	66357	66350	66354	an ill - used man	1212	” “
66379	66388	66350	66354	an ill - used man	1212	” Anne looked down to hide her smile . “
66428	66429	66423	66423	she	1214	” “
66510	66511	66533	66533	He	151	” “
66622	66672	66619	66619	I	0	” Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther . She therefore satisfied herself with common - place remarks or quiet attention , and the Admiral had it all his own way . “
66676	66682	66673	66674	Poor Frederick	200	” said he at last . “
66774	67947	66761	66762	Miss Elliot	98	” CHAPTER XIX . While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne , and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath , Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither . Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him . Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay . They were in Milsom Street . It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple ’s carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland ’s , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance . He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes . Her ladyship ’s carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort . Miss Carteret was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies . There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot . Whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two . The rain was a mere trifle , and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot . But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay ; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all , and her boots were so thick ! much thicker than Miss Anne ’s ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal , that his cousin Anne ’s boots were rather the thickest . It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when Anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , Captain Wentworth walking down the street . Her start was perceptible only to herself ; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world , the most unaccountable and absurd ! For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay ’s . She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained . Why was she to suspect herself of another motive ? Captain Wentworth must be out of sight . She left her seat , she would go ; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half , or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was . She would see if it rained . She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street . He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red . For the first time , since their renewed acquaintance , she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two . She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments . All the overpowering , blinding , bewildering , first effects of strong surprise were over with her . Still , however , she had enough to feel ! It was agitation , pain , pleasure , a something between delight and misery . He spoke to her , and then turned away . The character of his manner was embarrassment . She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed . After a short interval , however , he came towards her , and spoke again . Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly . They had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now . Time had changed him , or Louisa had changed him . There was consciousness of some sort or other . He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him . She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness . Lady Dalrymple ’s carriage , for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient , now drew up ; the servant came in to announce it . It was beginning to rain again , and altogether there was a delay , and a bustle , and a talking , which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot . At last Miss Elliot and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ) , were walking off ; and Captain Wentworth , watching them , turned again to Anne , and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her . “
67955	67960	67953	67953	you	1226	” was her answer , “
67984	67985	67977	67977	I	0	” “
67990	67991	67977	67977	I	0	” “
68002	68011	67999	67999	I	0	” After a moment ’s pause he said : “
68030	68039	68027	68027	you	1229	” ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; “
68072	68103	68104	68104	I	0	” She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , “
68124	68249	68112	68112	He	95	” She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in . Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly . There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a “
68255	68290	68112	68112	He	95	” being all that she had time for , as she passed away . As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of Captain Wentworth ’s party began talking of them . “
68302	68303	68299	68299	I	0	” “

68451	69042	68444	68444	Anne	98	” Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place , without saying a word . She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wo nt to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of Lady Russell , and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay . But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth . She could not understand his present feelings , whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not ; and till that point were settled , she could not be quite herself . She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas ! alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . Another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in Bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . He might be only passing through . But it was more probable that he should be come to stay . In that case , so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath , Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere . Would she recollect him ? How would it all be ? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick . It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell ’s surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth , her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him . The following morning Anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street . There were many other men about him , many groups walking the same way , but there was no mistaking him . She looked instinctively at Lady Russell ; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself . No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell ’s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him — of her being , in short , intently observing him . She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell ’s mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head . “
69052	69053	69047	69047	she	1239	” “
69058	69062	69047	69047	she	1239	” said she , “
69170	69468	69157	69157	I	0	” Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them . A day or two passed without producing anything . The theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the Elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and Anne , wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening . It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple . Of course they must attend . It was really expected to be a good one , and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music . If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred . Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention . She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow . Mrs Smith gave a most good - humoured acquiescence . “
69473	69477	69157	69157	I	0	” said she ; “
69495	69525	69157	69157	I	0	” Anne named them all . Mrs Smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , “
69567	69699	69702	69702	you	1247	” Anne was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment ’s suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away . CHAPTER XX . Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room . But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and Captain Wentworth walked in alone . Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke . He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle “
69705	69939	69702	69702	you	1247	” brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground . Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth ’s making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself . This , though late , and reluctant , and ungracious , was yet better than nothing , and her spirits improved . After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said — “
69974	69983	69951	69951	I	0	” She assured him that she had not . “
69990	69994	69951	69951	I	0	” said he , “
69999	70029	69951	69951	I	0	” and he passed his hand across his eyes , as if the remembrance were still too painful , but in a moment , half smiling again , added , “
70092	70093	70095	70095	I	0	” “
70126	70127	70143	70143	I	0	” “
70130	70139	70143	70143	I	0	” said he , looking not exactly forward ; “
70230	70275	70276	70276	I	0	” He stopped . A sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne ’s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground . After clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus — “
70482	70626	70474	70474	He	306	” Either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and Anne who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say — “
70638	70639	70627	70627	You	159	” “
70724	70725	70719	70719	I	0	” “
70736	70740	70726	70726	I	0	” said Anne . “
70796	70797	70785	70785	your	159	” “
70806	70810	70785	70785	your	159	” replied Anne ; “
70918	70929	71241	71241	He	1271	” ( with a faint blush at some recollections ) , “
70940	70962	70963	70964	Lady Dalrymple	185	” As she ceased , the entrance door opened again , and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting . “
70969	71235	70963	70964	Lady Dalrymple	185	” was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth . Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations . She was in good humour with all . She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself . The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by Captain Wentworth , she saw that he was gone . She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room . He was gone ; he had disappeared , she felt a moment ’s regret . But “
71283	71922	71272	71272	She	1272	” Upon Lady Russell ’s appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne — but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne ’s felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister ’s ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment . Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . Her happiness was from within . Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it . She was thinking only of the last half hour , and as they passed to their seats , her mind took a hasty range over it . His choice of subjects , his expressions , and still more his manner and look , had been such as she could see in only one light . His opinion of Louisa Musgrove ’s inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at Captain Benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less . He must love her . These were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him . When their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way . The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : Anne was among those on the foremost , and Mr Elliot had manœuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis , as to have a seat by her . Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis ’s gallantry , was quite contented . Anne ’s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act . Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot . They had a concert bill between them . “
71925	71929	71272	71272	She	1272	” said she , “
71989	71990	71983	71987	a very poor Italian scholar	1273	” “
72053	72054	72055	72055	I	0	” “
72076	72077	72072	72074	a real proficient	1274	” “
72092	72096	72078	72078	I	0	” replied he , “
72143	72144	72109	72109	her	98	” “
72166	72172	72157	72157	I	0	” turning to the bill . “
72175	72183	72157	72157	I	0	” said Mr Elliot , speaking low , “
72199	72200	72184	72184	I	0	” “
72234	72235	72236	72236	I	0	” “
72288	72361	72390	72390	her	1281	” Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise . No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery . To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and Anne was all curiosity . She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain . He delighted in being asked , but he would not tell . “
72431	72482	72486	72487	Anne Elliot	98	” Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth ’s brother . He might have been in Mr Elliot ’s company , but she had not courage to ask the question . “
72489	72493	72486	72487	Anne Elliot	98	” said he , “
72532	72577	72578	72582	A well - looking man	1282	” Such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial . Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking . “
72584	72589	72590	72595	a very well - looking man	1283	” said Sir Walter , “
72597	72598	72590	72595	a very well - looking man	1283	” “
72606	72611	72599	72603	A very fine young man	2175	” said Lady Dalrymple . “
72627	72628	72621	72621	Irish	206	” “
72664	73577	72657	72658	the Croft	1289	” Before Sir Walter had reached this point , Anne ’s eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance . As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her . It had that appearance . It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward . When she could give another glance , he had moved away . He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye . Mr Elliot ’s speech , too , distressed her . She had no longer any inclination to talk to him . She wished him not so near her . The first act was over . Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move . She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell ’s account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity . She was persuaded by Lady Russell ’s countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however . Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came . The anxious interval wore away unproductively . The others returned , the room filled again , benches were reclaimed and repossessed , and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out , another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes , as real or affected taste for it prevailed . To Anne , it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation . She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more , without the interchange of one friendly look . In re - settling themselves there were now many changes , the result of which was favourable for her . Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by . She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed . Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight . She saw him not far off . He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great . Why was it ? She thought of her father , of Lady Russell . Could there have been any unpleasant glances ? He began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over . Anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile . They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round . It came from Mr Elliot . He begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain Italian again . Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung . Anne could not refuse ; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit . A few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth , in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell . “
73599	73600	72657	72658	the Croft	1289	” “
73609	73628	72657	72658	the Croft	1289	” said Anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging . “
73631	73636	72657	72658	the Croft	1289	” he replied impressively , “
73645	74171	72657	72658	the Croft	1289	” and he was gone directly . Jealousy of Mr Elliot ! It was the only intelligible motive . Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection ! Could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago ! For a moment the gratification was exquisite . But , alas ! there were very different thoughts to succeed . How was such jealousy to be quieted ? How was the truth to reach him ? How , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ? It was misery to think of Mr Elliot ’s attentions . Their evil was incalculable . CHAPTER XXI . Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . She felt a great deal of good - will towards him . In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession . It was altogether very extraordinary ; flattering , but painful . There was much to regret . How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a Captain Wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever . Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation . Prettier musings of high - wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of Bath , than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings . It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way . She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment . An account of the concert was immediately claimed ; and Anne ’s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it . All that she could tell she told most gladly , but the all was little for one who had been there , and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith , who had already heard , through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter , rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate , and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company . Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith . “

74545	74552	74554	74554	you	0	” Anne half smiled and said , “
74561	74562	74554	74554	you	0	” “
74613	74626	74593	74611	the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together	1302	” A blush overspread Anne ’s cheeks . She could say nothing . “
74633	74643	74644	74644	I	0	” continued Mrs Smith , after a short pause , “
74690	74731	74751	74751	he	95	” Anne heard nothing of this . She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend ’s penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence — “
74734	74739	74751	74751	he	95	” said Mrs Smith , “
74759	74760	74751	74751	he	95	” “
74764	74806	74751	74751	he	95	” repeated Anne , looking up surprised . A moment ’s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under . She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , “
74814	74815	74811	74812	Mr Elliot	95	” “
74826	74833	74816	74816	I	0	” replied Mrs Smith , gravely , “

74892	74904	74881	74881	him	95	” said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , “
74970	74971	74945	74945	you	0	” “
74996	75000	74980	74980	you	0	” replied Anne ; “
75085	75101	75077	75077	you	0	” Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said — “
75183	75184	75202	75202	I	0	” “
75187	75191	75202	75202	I	0	” replied Anne , “
75240	75260	75235	75235	you	0	” Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed — “

75451	75452	75436	75436	He	95	” “
75462	75469	75436	75436	He	95	” cried Mrs Smith , archly , “

75658	75662	75673	75673	He	95	” said Anne , “
75854	75964	75850	75851	Mr Elliot	95	” She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient . Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot ’s failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and Anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it . “
75976	75977	75850	75851	Mr Elliot	95	” “
75985	75990	75850	75851	Mr Elliot	95	” replied Mrs Smith , “

76238	76244	76217	76217	She	1329	” Mrs Smith said nothing . “
76247	76253	76217	76217	She	1329	” continued Anne , presently , “

76473	76520	76463	76463	I	0	” was Mrs Smith ’s answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity . They were both silent : Mrs Smith very thoughtful . At last — “
76531	76542	76521	76521	I	0	” she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality , “
76822	76846	76847	76847	My	0	” Anne ’s astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added , “
77109	77110	77104	77104	he	1357	” “
77125	77129	77104	77104	he	1357	” said Anne , “

77390	77394	77356	77356	her	1698	” said Anne , “

77469	77474	77479	77479	his	95	” replied Mrs Smith , “
77676	77677	77661	77661	He	95	” “
77680	77690	77691	77691	you	95	” cried Anne , struck by a sudden idea , “
77700	77701	77691	77691	you	95	” “
77732	77740	77711	77711	I	0	” She checked herself just in time . “
77752	77756	77746	77747	Mr Elliot	95	” cried Anne . “
77828	77836	77798	77798	your	98	” Mrs Smith hesitated a little here . “
77951	77952	77956	77956	she	1391	” “
77962	77963	77956	77956	she	1391	” “
78212	78213	78218	78219	Mrs Smith	187	” “
78225	78229	78218	78219	Mrs Smith	187	” cried Anne . “
78277	78278	78270	78270	he	95	” “
78333	78375	78309	78309	yourself	1404	” Anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired . The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said — “
78535	78543	78544	78545	Charles Smith	214	” This was the letter , directed to “
78552	78567	78544	78545	Charles Smith	214	” and dated from London , as far back as July , 1803 : — “
78571	78740	78568	78569	Dear Smith	215	“ I have received yours . Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again . Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year . “
78796	78801	78770	78770	you	1414	“ WM . ELLIOT . ”
78830	78880	78817	78818	Mrs Smith	187	“ The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ? ”
78965	78991	78946	78946	she	98	“ Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ? ”
78992	78999	79001	79002	Mrs Smith	187	“ I can explain this too , ”
79006	79011	79001	79002	Mrs Smith	187	“ Can you really ? ”
79012	79114	78946	78946	she	98	“ Yes . I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now . I can not produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now . He truly wants to marry you . His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart . I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis . ”
79115	79125	78946	78946	she	98	“ Colonel Wallis ! you are acquainted with him ? ”
79126	79318	79001	79002	Mrs Smith	187	“ No . It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence . The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed . ”
79319	79383	78946	78946	she	98	“ My dear Mrs Smith , your authority is deficient . This will not do . Mr Elliot ’s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . That was all prior to my coming to Bath . I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived . ”
79384	79398	78946	78946	she	98	“ I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but — ”
79399	79452	79001	79002	Mrs Smith	187	“ Indeed , Mrs Smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line . Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left . ”
79453	79562	78946	78946	she	98	“ Only give me a hearing . You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . So says my historian , at least . Is this true ? Did he see you last summer or autumn , ‘ somewhere down in the west , ’ to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? ”
79563	79585	78946	78946	she	98	“ He certainly did . So far it is very true . At Lyme . I happened to be at Lyme . ”
79586	79589	79591	79592	Mrs Smith	187	“ Well , ”
79596	79814	79591	79592	Mrs Smith	187	“ grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister ’s friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter ’s acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . ”
79835	80305	79832	79832	she	187	“ This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot ’s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . He can not bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . ”
80306	80309	80311	80311	Anne	98	“ Yes , ”
80313	80441	80311	80311	Anne	98	“ you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manœuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . ”
80442	80448	80450	80451	Mrs Smith	187	“ Lessening , I understand , ”
80453	80676	80450	80451	Mrs Smith	187	“ He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay . A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis ’s understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it . ‘ Why , to be sure , ma’am , ’ said she , ‘ it would not prevent his marrying anybody else . ’ And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter ’s making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis ’s recommendation ? ”
80677	80687	80689	80689	Anne	98	“ I am very glad to know all this , ”
80696	80757	80689	80689	Anne	98	“ It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do . My line of conduct will be more direct . Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . ”
81799	81809	81783	81784	Mrs Smith	187	“ She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! ”
81810	81814	81816	81817	Mrs Smith	187	“ My dear , ”
81821	81945	81816	81817	Mrs Smith	187	“ there was nothing else to be done . I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . He was very unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together . But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better . ”
82439	82450	82452	82452	Elizabeth	96	“ I had not the smallest intention of asking him , ”
82458	82474	82452	82452	Elizabeth	96	“ but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . ”
82475	82522	82452	82452	Elizabeth	96	“ Indeed , I do say it . I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . Poor man ! I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty . ”
82523	82526	82528	82528	Elizabeth	96	“ Oh ! ”
82530	82617	82528	82528	Elizabeth	96	“ I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman ’s hints . However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together . They appear to so much advantage in company with each other . Each behaving so pleasantly . Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect . ”
82618	82622	82624	82625	Mrs Clay	108	“ Quite delightful ! ”
82639	82658	82624	82625	Mrs Clay	108	“ Exactly like father and son ! Dear Miss Elliot , may I not say father and son ? ”
82659	82699	82528	82528	Elizabeth	96	“ Oh ! I lay no embargo on any body ’s words . If you will have such ideas ! But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . ”
82700	82706	82708	82709	Mrs Clay	108	“ My dear Miss Elliot ! ”
82730	82788	82708	82709	Mrs Clay	108	“ Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him . ”
83450	83454	83456	83456	Elizabeth	96	“ Very well , ”
83458	83587	83456	83456	Elizabeth	96	“ I have nothing to send but my love . Oh ! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through . I really can not be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out . Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications . You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night . I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . Something so formal and _ arrangé _ in her air ! and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . ”
83588	83592	83594	83595	Sir Walter	94	“ And mine , ”
83597	83678	83594	83595	Sir Walter	94	“ Kindest regards . And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon . Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . ”
83742	83748	83697	83697	Anne	98	“ Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove ”
84357	84366	84367	84367	Charles	100	“ And a very good living it was , ”
84370	84448	84449	84449	he	100	“ only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire . In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation . Not that he will value it as he ought , ”
84452	84467	84449	84449	he	100	“ Charles is too cool about sporting . That ’s the worst of him . ”
84468	84476	84478	84478	Anne	98	“ I am extremely glad , indeed , ”
84480	84549	84478	84478	Anne	98	“ particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other — that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . ”
84550	84726	84449	84449	he	100	“ Oh ! yes . My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . Money , you know , coming down with money — two daughters at once — it can not be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it . It is very fit they should have daughters ’ shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me . Mary does not above half like Henrietta ’s match . She never did , you know . But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop . I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . ”
84727	84737	84739	84739	Anne	98	“ Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , ”
84741	84812	84813	84813	He	1490	“ should be happy in their children ’s marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? ”
84818	84898	84813	84813	He	1490	“ Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long . ”
84905	84918	84920	84920	she	98	“ That can not be much to your taste , I know , ”
84922	84935	84920	84920	she	98	“ but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . ”
84936	85072	84813	84813	He	1490	“ To be sure he is . Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say . His reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read . He is a brave fellow . I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before . We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father ’s great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since . ”
85362	85502	85358	85358	her	96	“ Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister ’s family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way . I am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us . I will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat . They have not seen two such drawing rooms before . They will be delighted to come to - morrow evening . It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant . ”
86163	86210	86219	86219	she	98	dependence:—“Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment ’s inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness . ”
86251	86254	86256	86256	Mary	99	“ Anne , ”
86263	86324	86256	86256	Mary	99	“ there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me . Good heavens ! I recollect . It is Mr Elliot himself . ”
86325	86328	86330	86330	Anne	98	“ No , ”
86334	86366	86330	86330	Anne	98	“ it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . ”
86528	86534	86536	86536	Mary	99	“ Do come , Anne , ”
86538	86586	86536	86536	Mary	99	“ come and look yourself . You will be too late if you do not make haste . They are parting ; they are shaking hands . He is turning away . Not know Mr Elliot , indeed ! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme . ”
86672	86708	86668	86668	she	98	“ Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; ”
86761	86852	86736	86736	Charles	101	“ Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like . I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to - morrow night . A’n’t I a good boy ? I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all . It holds nine . I have engaged Captain Wentworth . Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure . We all like a play . Have not I done well , mother ? ”
86885	86965	86878	86878	Mary	99	“ Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ? Take a box for to - morrow night ! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? How can you be so forgetful ? ”
86966	86971	86973	86973	Charles	101	“ Phoo ! phoo ! ”
86975	87021	86973	86973	Charles	101	“ what ’s an evening party ? Never worth remembering . Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us . You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play . ”
87022	87044	86878	86878	Mary	99	“ Oh ! Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go . ”
87045	87072	86878	86878	Mary	99	“ No , I did not promise . I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ‘ happy . ’ There was no promise . ”
87073	87168	86878	86878	Mary	99	“ But you must go , Charles . It would be unpardonable to fail . We were asked on purpose to be introduced . There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves . Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot . Consider , my father ’s heir : the future representative of the family . ”
87169	87180	87182	87182	Charles	101	“ Do n’t talk to me about heirs and representatives , ”
87184	87236	87182	87182	Charles	101	“ I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ? ”
87353	87430	87349	87350	Mrs Musgrove	101	“ We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father ’s ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . ”
87456	87522	87523	87523	She	98	“ If it depended only on my inclination , ma’am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary ’s account ) would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . ”
87636	87646	87648	87648	he	146	“ You have not been long enough in Bath , ”
87650	87660	87648	87648	he	146	“ to enjoy the evening parties of the place . ”
87661	87683	87736	87736	he	146	“ Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card - player . ”
87684	87707	87648	87648	he	146	“ You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes . ”
87708	87717	87719	87719	Anne	98	“ I am not yet so much changed , ”
87750	87767	87736	87736	he	146	“ It is a period , indeed ! Eight years and a half is a period . ”
88096	88112	88078	88078	she	96	“ To - morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party . ”
88131	88137	88078	88078	she	96	“ Miss Elliot at home , ”
88365	88374	88376	88376	Mary	99	“ Only think of Elizabeth ’s including everybody ! ”
88380	88403	88376	88376	Mary	99	“ I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he can not put the card out of his hand . ”
88846	89010	88832	88832	She	98	“ Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard . He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow . He was full of ‘ to - morrow , ’ and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . ”
89339	89361	89335	89336	Captain Wentworth	146	“ We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . ”
89463	89539	89583	89584	Mrs Croft	115	“ how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , ”
89620	89631	89633	89634	Mrs Musgrove	122	“ And so , ma’am , all these thing considered , ”
89641	89725	89633	89634	Mrs Musgrove	122	“ though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement . ”
89726	89737	89739	89740	Mrs Croft	115	“ That is precisely what I was going to observe , ”
89742	89782	89739	89740	Mrs Croft	115	“ I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual — ”
89783	89790	89792	89793	Mrs Musgrove	122	“ Oh ! dear Mrs Croft , ”
89803	89872	89792	89793	Mrs Musgrove	122	“ there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement . It is what I always protested against for my children . It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement — ”
89873	89879	89881	89882	Mrs Croft	115	“ Yes , dear ma’am , ”
89884	89937	89881	89882	Mrs Croft	115	“ or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can . ”
90148	90159	90129	90129	He	157	“ Come to me , I have something to say ; ”
90252	90256	90258	90258	he	157	“ Look here , ”
90274	90282	90258	90258	he	157	“ do you know who that is ? ”
90283	90289	90465	90465	he	146	“ Certainly : Captain Benwick . ”
90290	90304	90258	90258	he	157	“ Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , ”
90312	90443	90258	90258	he	157	“ it was not done for her . Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I little thought then — but no matter . This was drawn at the Cape . He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! It was a commission to me ! But who else was there to employ ? I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . He undertakes it ; ”
90451	90459	90465	90465	he	146	“ he is writing about it now . ”
90473	90486	90465	90465	he	146	“ Poor Fanny ! she would not have forgotten him so soon ! ”
90487	90490	90492	90492	Anne	98	“ No , ”
90501	90508	90492	90492	Anne	98	“ That I can easily believe . ”
90509	90522	90465	90465	he	146	“ It was not in her nature . She doted on him . ”
90523	90537	90538	90539	Captain Harville	157	“ It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . ”
90548	90557	90538	90539	Captain Harville	157	“ Do you claim that for your sex ? ”
90567	90656	90559	90559	she	98	“ Yes . We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . It is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . We can not help ourselves . We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . You are forced on exertion . You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . ”
90657	90729	90465	90465	he	146	“ Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to Benwick . He has not been forced upon any exertion . The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . ”
90730	90733	90735	90735	Anne	98	“ True , ”
90737	90789	90735	90735	Anne	98	“ very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man ’s nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick . ”
90790	90877	90465	90465	he	146	“ No , no , it is not man ’s nature . I will not allow it to be more man ’s nature than woman ’s to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . I believe the reverse . I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . ”
90878	90886	90888	90888	Anne	98	“ Your feelings may be the strongest , ”
90890	91009	90888	90888	Anne	98	“ but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed ”
91017	91030	90888	90888	Anne	98	“ if woman ’s feelings were to be added to all this . ”
91031	91040	91041	91042	Captain Harville	157	“ We shall never agree upon this question , ”
91127	91134	91136	91137	Captain Harville	157	“ Have you finished your letter ? ”
91139	91156	91136	91137	Captain Harville	157	“ Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes . ”
91157	91182	91214	91214	his	157	“ There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , ”
91189	91211	91214	91214	his	157	“ well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot , ”
91218	91334	91214	91214	his	157	“ as I was saying , we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point . No man and woman would , probably . But let me observe that all histories are against you — all stories , prose and verse . If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman ’s inconstancy . Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman ’s fickleness . But perhaps you will say , these were all written by men . ”
91335	91396	91136	91137	Captain Harville	157	“ Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything . ”
91397	91405	91136	91137	Captain Harville	157	“ But how shall we prove anything ? ”
91406	91512	91214	91214	his	157	“ We never shall . We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said . ”
91513	91516	91518	91519	Captain Harville	157	“ Ah ! ”
91528	91742	91744	91744	his	1575	“ if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ‘ God knows whether we ever meet again ! ’ And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth ’s absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ‘ They can not be here till such a day , ’ but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence ! I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! ”
91749	91752	91754	91754	Anne	98	“ Oh ! ”
91757	91922	91754	91754	Anne	98	“ I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as — if I may be allowed the expression — so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . ”
91944	91951	91953	91954	Captain Harville	157	“ You are a good soul , ”
91966	91986	91957	91957	his	157	“ There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . ”
92001	92015	92017	92017	she	115	“ Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , ”
92019	92050	92017	92017	she	115	“ I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , ”
92057	92098	92017	92017	she	115	“ We had your sister ’s card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? ”
92120	92123	92125	92125	he	146	“ Yes , ”
92127	92184	92125	92125	he	146	“ very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute . ”
92234	92242	92230	92230	She	98	“ Good morning , God bless you ! ”
92407	92413	92419	92419	he	157	“ Miss A. E. — , ”
92520	92777	92513	92513	her	98	“ I can listen no longer in silence . I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope . Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone , I think and plan . Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . Too good , too excellent creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in F. W. “
92826	93031	92817	92817	your	1586	” Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from . Half an hour ’s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing towards tranquillity . Every moment rather brought fresh agitation . It was overpowering happiness . And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , Charles , Mary , and Henrietta all came in . The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more . She began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself . They could then see that she looked very ill , were shocked and concerned , and would not stir without her for the world . This was dreadful . Would they only have gone away , and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure ; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting , and in desperation , she said she would go home . “
93039	93044	92817	92817	your	1586	” cried Mrs Musgrove , “
93093	93238	93239	93239	I	0	” But the chair would never do . Worse than all ! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said — “
93304	93305	93319	93319	my	0	” “
93331	93332	93334	93334	you	644	” “
93381	93382	93379	93379	me	0	” “
93446	93676	93442	93442	I	0	” Anne could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity . It could not be very lasting , however . Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville . Another momentary vexation occurred . Charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him . This was almost cruel . But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith ’s , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent . They were on Union Street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ’ preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth . He joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked . Anne could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively . The cheeks which had been pale now glowed , and the movements which had hesitated were decided . He walked by her side . Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said — “
93697	93698	93699	93699	I	0	” “
93703	93710	93699	93699	I	0	” replied Captain Wentworth , surprised . “
93862	94729	94730	94730	I	0	” There could not be an objection . There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement . There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re - union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other ’s character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery - maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and to - day there could scarcely be an end . She had not mistaken him . Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings . Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . He persisted in having loved none but her . She had never been supplanted . He never even believed himself to see her equal . Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself . At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville ’s had fixed her superiority . In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa ’s could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . From that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa ’s accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty . “
94733	94737	94730	94730	I	0	” said he , “
94904	95016	94892	94892	I	0	” He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed . It determined him to leave Lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere . He would gladly weaken , by any fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother ’s , meaning after a while to return to Kellynch , and act as circumstances might require . “
95024	95028	95017	95017	I	0	” said he , “
95071	95198	95045	95045	He	131	” Anne smiled , and let it pass . It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight - and - twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick . “
95201	95205	95045	95045	He	131	” said he , “
95379	95457	95365	95365	I	0	” Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said , but the concert still more . That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments . The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot ’s appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy . “
95462	95466	95365	95365	I	0	” cried he , “
95610	95611	95612	95612	You	1612	” “
95617	95621	95612	95612	You	1612	” replied Anne . “
95711	95712	95714	95714	I	0	” “
95721	95725	95714	95714	I	0	” he replied , “
95844	95845	95846	95846	I	0	” “
95851	95855	95846	95846	I	0	” said Anne , “
95871	95872	95846	95846	I	0	” “
95931	96317	95922	95922	I	0	” At last Anne was at home again , and happier than any one in that house could have conceived . All the surprise and suspense , and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation , she re - entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last . An interval of meditation , serious and grateful , was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high - wrought felicity ; and she went to her room , and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment . The evening came , the drawing - rooms were lighted up , the company assembled . It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but Anne had never found an evening shorter . Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness , and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for , she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her . Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him . The Wallises , she had amusement in understanding them . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret — they would soon be innoxious cousins to her . She cared not for Mrs Clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there . It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said — “
96546	96571	96527	96527	I	0	” He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation — “
96687	96688	96676	96676	you	1635	” “
96692	96705	96690	96690	I	0	” was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough . “
96709	96713	96714	96714	you	1635	” he cried , “
96853	96861	96862	96862	I	0	” he added , with a smile . “
