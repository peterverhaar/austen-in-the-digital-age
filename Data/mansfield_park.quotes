1173	1231	1232	1233	Lady Bertram	106	“ What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter , a girl now nine years old , of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give ? The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing , compared with the benevolence of the action . ”
1239	1248	1250	1250	she	106	“ I think we can not do better , ”
1252	1260	1250	1250	she	106	“ let us send for the child . ”
1353	1803	1337	1338	Mrs. Norris	105	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . Having no children of my own , who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow , but the children of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions . Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle . Give a girl an education , and introduce her properly into the world , and ten to one but she has the means of settling well , without farther expense to anybody . A niece of ours , Sir Thomas , I may say , or at least of _ yours _ , would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages . I do n’t say she would be so handsome as her cousins . I dare say she would not ; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as , in all human probability , would get her a creditable establishment . You are thinking of your sons — but do not you know that , of all things upon earth , _ that _ is the least likely to happen , brought up as they would be , always together like brothers and sisters ? It is morally impossible . I never knew an instance of it . It is , in fact , the only sure way of providing against the connexion . Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief . The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect , would be enough to make either of the dear , sweet - tempered boys in love with her . But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister . ”
1804	1817	1819	1820	Sir Thomas	101	“ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ”
1822	1925	1819	1820	Sir Thomas	101	“ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each . I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ”
1926	1932	1934	1935	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I thoroughly understand you , ”
1937	2236	1934	1935	Mrs. Norris	105	“ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . Is not she a sister ’s child ? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her ? My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing . So , if you are not against it , I will write to my poor sister tomorrow , and make the proposal ; and , as soon as matters are settled , _ I _ will engage to get the child to Mansfield ; _ you _ shall have no trouble about it . My own trouble , you know , I never regard . I will send Nanny to London on purpose , and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler ’s , and the child be appointed to meet her there . They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach , under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going . I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman ’s wife or other going up . ”
2615	2632	2609	2610	Lady Bertram	106	“ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ? ”
2822	2831	2833	2834	Lady Bertram	106	“ Then she had better come to us , ”
2851	2895	2845	2846	Sir Thomas	101	“ Yes , let her home be in this house . We will endeavour to do our duty by her , and she will , at least , have the advantage of companions of her own age , and of a regular instructress . ”
2896	2900	2902	2903	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Very true , ”
2905	3101	2902	2903	Mrs. Norris	105	“ which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two — there can be no difference . I only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power . I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days . I suppose , sister , you will put the child in the little white attic , near the old nurseries . It will be much the best place for her , so near Miss Lee , and not far from the girls , and close by the housemaids , who could either of them help to dress her , you know , and take care of her clothes , for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others . Indeed , I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else . ”
3108	3120	3122	3123	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I hope she will prove a well - disposed girl , ”
3125	3139	3122	3123	Mrs. Norris	105	“ and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends . ”
3140	3148	3150	3151	Sir Thomas	101	“ Should her disposition be really bad , ”
3153	3294	3150	3151	Sir Thomas	101	“ we must not , for our own children ’s sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil . We shall probably see much to wish altered in her , and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance , some meanness of opinions , and very distressing vulgarity of manner ; but these are not incurable faults ; nor , I trust , can they be dangerous for her associates . Had my daughters been _ younger _ than herself , I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment ; but , as it is , I hope there can be nothing to fear for _ them _ , and everything to hope for _ her _ , from the association . ”
3295	3303	3305	3306	Mrs. Norris	105	“ That is exactly what I think , ”
3308	3358	3305	3306	Mrs. Norris	105	“ and what I was saying to my husband this morning . It will be an education for the child , said I , only being with her cousins ; if Miss Lee taught her nothing , she would learn to be good and clever from _ them _ . ”
3359	3370	3372	3373	Lady Bertram	106	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ”
3375	3387	3372	3373	Lady Bertram	106	“ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone . ”
3388	3401	3403	3404	Sir Thomas	101	“ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ”
3406	3552	3403	3404	Sir Thomas	101	“ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _ daughters _ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _ Miss Bertram _ . I should wish to see them very good friends , and would , on no account , authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation ; but still they can not be equals . Their rank , fortune , rights , and expectations will always be different . It is a point of great delicacy , and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct . ”
4387	4396	4398	4399	Mrs. Norris	105	“ This is not a very promising beginning , ”
4408	4531	4398	4399	Mrs. Norris	105	“ After all that I said to her as we came along , I thought she would have behaved better ; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first . I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper — her poor mother had a good deal ; but we must make allowances for such a child — and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _ was _ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things . ”
5003	5009	5011	5011	he	108	“ My dear little cousin , ”
5022	5029	5011	5011	he	108	“ what can be the matter ? ”
5121	5134	5092	5092	she	414	“ no , no — not at all — no , thank you ”
5172	5185	5187	5187	he	108	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ”
5189	5244	5187	5187	he	108	“ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . ”
5328	5350	5314	5315	her mother	446	“ William did not like she should come away ; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed . ”
5351	5363	5321	5322	the darling	447	“ But William will write to you , I dare say . ”
5364	5384	5321	5322	the darling	447	“ Yes , he had promised he would , but he had told _ her _ to write first . ”
5385	5393	5314	5315	her mother	446	“ And when shall you do it ? ”
5402	5414	5394	5394	She	440	“ she did not know ; she had not any paper . ”
5415	5454	5321	5322	the darling	447	“ If that be all your difficulty , I will furnish you with paper and every other material , and you may write your letter whenever you choose . Would it make you happy to write to William ? ”
5455	5460	5321	5322	the darling	447	“ Yes , very . ”
5461	5494	5321	5322	the darling	447	“ Then let it be done now . Come with me into the breakfast - room , we shall find everything there , and be sure of having the room to ourselves . ”
5495	5507	5321	5322	the darling	447	“ But , cousin , will it go to the post ? ”
5508	5540	5321	5322	the darling	447	“ Yes , depend upon me it shall : it shall go with the other letters ; and , as your uncle will frank it , it will cost William nothing . ”
5541	5545	5547	5547	Fanny	113	“ My uncle ! ”
5554	5574	5547	5547	Fanny	113	“ Yes , when you have written the letter , I will take it to my father to frank . ”
6073	6081	6082	6082	Edmund	108	“ Fanny was good - natured enough . ”
6307	6367	6279	6279	they	3671	“ Dear mama , only think , my cousin can not put the map of Europe together — or my cousin can not tell the principal rivers in Russia — or , she never heard of Asia Minor — or she does not know the difference between water - colours and crayons!—How strange!—Did you ever hear anything so stupid ? ”
6368	6372	6373	6375	their considerate aunt	476	“ My dear , ”
6379	6402	6373	6375	their considerate aunt	476	“ it is very bad , but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself . ”
6403	6567	6373	6375	their considerate aunt	476	“ But , aunt , she is really so very ignorant!—Do you know , we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the Isle of Wight . She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight , and she calls it _ the _ _ Island _ , as if there were no other island in the world . I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself , if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is . I can not remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet . How long ago it is , aunt , since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England , with the dates of their accession , and most of the principal events of their reigns ! ”
6568	6571	6573	6574	the other	477	“ Yes , ”
6576	6611	6573	6574	the other	477	“ and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus ; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology , and all the metals , semi - metals , planets , and distinguished philosophers . ”
6612	6709	6373	6375	their considerate aunt	476	“ Very true indeed , my dears , but you are blessed with wonderful memories , and your poor cousin has probably none at all . There is a vast deal of difference in memories , as well as in everything else , and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin , and pity her deficiency . And remember that , if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves , you should always be modest ; for , much as you know already , there is a great deal more for you to learn . ”
6710	6756	6373	6375	their considerate aunt	476	“ Yes , I know there is , till I am seventeen . But I must tell you another thing of Fanny , so odd and so stupid . Do you know , she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing . ”
6757	6858	6373	6375	their considerate aunt	476	“ To be sure , my dear , that is very stupid indeed , and shows a great want of genius and emulation . But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;—on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . ”
7102	7177	7178	7178	Fanny	113	“ she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _ were _ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . ”
8264	8272	8274	8274	he	101	“ I blush for you , Tom , ”
8282	8412	8274	8274	he	101	“ I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ”
8540	8568	8569	8569	He	101	“ no , he was a short - necked , apoplectic sort of fellow , and , plied well with good things , would soon pop off . ”
8766	8790	8760	8760	she	546	“ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . How shall you like it ? ”
8806	8812	8760	8760	she	546	“ Going to leave you ? ”
8813	8860	8760	8760	she	546	“ Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ? You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . ”
8890	8900	8902	8902	she	546	“ I shall be very sorry to go away , ”
8909	8948	8902	8902	she	546	“ Yes , I dare say you will ; _ that ’s _ natural enough . I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . ”
8949	8959	8961	8961	Fanny	113	“ I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ”
8964	8984	8961	8961	Fanny	113	“ No , my dear ; I hope not . I have always found you a very good girl . ”
8985	8995	8902	8902	she	546	“ And am I never to live here again ? ”
8996	9030	9031	9031	Fanny	113	“ Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other . ”
9079	9082	9084	9084	she	550	“ Cousin , ”
9086	9139	9084	9084	she	550	“ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . ”
9140	9143	9073	9073	she	550	“ Indeed ! ”
9144	9186	9073	9073	she	550	“ Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . It is quite settled . I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . ”
9187	9210	9084	9084	she	550	“ Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . ”
9211	9216	9073	9073	she	550	“ Oh , cousin ! ”
9217	9286	9073	9073	she	550	“ It has everything else in its favour . My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . You will be what you ought to be to her . I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ”
9287	9322	9073	9073	she	550	“ Indeed it does : I can not like it . I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there . You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . ”
9323	9397	9073	9073	she	550	“ I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so . She never knew how to be pleasant to children . But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her . ”
9398	9408	9073	9073	she	550	“ I can never be important to any one . ”
9409	9416	9073	9073	she	550	“ What is to prevent you ? ”
9417	9428	9073	9073	she	550	“ Everything . My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . ”
9429	9522	9073	9073	she	550	“ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . ”
9523	9529	9531	9531	Fanny	113	“ You are too kind , ”
9538	9580	9531	9531	Fanny	113	“ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . Oh ! cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ”
9581	9696	9073	9073	she	550	“ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House . You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . The two families will be meeting every day in the year . The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be . _ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . ”
9697	9705	9073	9073	she	550	“ Oh ! do not say so . ”
9706	9766	9531	9531	Fanny	113	“ I must say it , and say it with pleasure . Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now . She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ”
9773	9859	9767	9767	Fanny	113	“ I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be . If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody . _ Here _ , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well . ”
9860	9940	9073	9073	she	550	“ The place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house . You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever . Even _ your _ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . ”
9941	10057	9073	9073	she	550	“ Very true . Yes , dear old grey pony ! Ah ! cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle ’s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well . ”
10058	10094	9531	9531	Fanny	113	“ And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . ”
10297	10320	10294	10295	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ”
10326	10340	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Live with me , dear Lady Bertram ! what do you mean ? ”
10341	10360	11128	11129	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Is she not to live with you ? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . ”
10361	10524	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Me ! never . I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me . Fanny live with me ! the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both . Good heaven ! what could I do with Fanny ? Me ! a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ? A girl of fifteen ! the very age of all others to need most attention and care , and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test ! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing ! Sir Thomas is too much my friend . Nobody that wishes me well , I am sure , would propose it . How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ? ”
10525	10540	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Indeed , I do not know . I suppose he thought it best . ”
10541	10576	11128	11129	Mrs. Norris	105	“ But what did he say ? He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny . I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . ”
10577	10628	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too . We both thought it would be a comfort to you . But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . She is no encumbrance here . ”
10629	10780	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ? Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl . She is in good hands , and sure of doing well . I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can . ”
10781	10793	11128	11129	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? ”
10794	10960	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Lady Bertram , I do not complain . I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager . I _ have _ _ been _ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . My situation is as much altered as my income . A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me . It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers . At the White House , matters must be better looked after . I _ must _ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more , to lay by a little at the end of the year . ”
10961	10976	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I dare say you will . You always do , do n’t you ? ”
10977	11038	11128	11129	Mrs. Norris	105	“ My object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me . It is for your children ’s good that I wish to be richer . I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . ”
11039	11070	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . They are sure of being well provided for . Sir Thomas will take care of that . ”
11071	11096	10321	10322	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Why , you know , Sir Thomas ’s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . ”
11097	11119	11128	11129	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Oh ! _ that _ will soon be settled . Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . ”
11120	11126	11128	11129	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ”
11135	11212	11128	11129	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . ”
11536	11653	11654	11655	Lady Bertram	106	“ Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself ; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place . _ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds . ”
12108	12148	12149	12149	He	101	“ Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! it was a shameful insensibility . ”
12207	12215	12218	12218	he	101	“ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ”
12228	12233	12218	12218	he	101	“ my dear Fanny , ”
12269	12330	12251	12251	he	101	“ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ”
13087	13090	13096	13097	her aunts	624	“ because , ”
13099	13119	13096	13097	her aunts	624	“ she might ride one of her cousin ’s horses at any time when they did not want them , ”
13279	13285	13250	13250	he	108	“ Fanny must have a horse ”
13463	13470	13492	13492	she	106	“ Fanny must have a horse , ”
14156	14180	14181	14181	she	106	“ If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , ”
14808	14826	14796	14796	he	108	company—“If this man had not twelve thousand a year , he would be a very stupid fellow . ”
15819	15823	15825	15826	Mrs. Grant	123	“ And now , ”
15828	15883	15825	15826	Mrs. Grant	123	“ I have thought of something to make it complete . I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good - humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy . ”
15890	15895	15897	15897	Mary	132	“ My dear sister , ”
15899	16060	15897	15897	Mary	132	“ if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of . If you can persuade Henry to marry , you must have the address of a Frenchwoman . All that English abilities can do has been tried already . I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable ! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined . If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry . ”
16061	16074	15825	15826	Mrs. Grant	123	“ My dear brother , I will not believe this of you . ”
16075	16159	15897	15897	Mary	132	“ No , I am sure you are too good . You will be kinder than Mary . You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience . I am of a cautious temper , and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry . Nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself . I consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet—‘Heaven ’s _ last _ best gift . ’ ”
16160	16199	15825	15826	Mrs. Grant	123	“ There , Mrs. Grant , you see how he dwells on one word , and only look at his smile . I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ”
16200	16207	16209	16210	Mrs. Grant	123	“ I pay very little regard , ”
16212	16248	16209	16210	Mrs. Grant	123	“ to what any young person says on the subject of marriage . If they profess a disinclination for it , I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person . ”
16264	16314	16249	16250	Dr. Grant	121	“ Oh yes ! I am not at all ashamed of it . I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly : I do not like to have people throw themselves away ; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage . ”
16653	16679	16644	16644	She	126	“ There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man — everybody knew her situation — Mr. Crawford must take care of himself . ”
16753	16763	16765	16765	he	133	“ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ”
16782	16791	16768	16768	he	133	“ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ”
16792	16814	16765	16765	he	133	“ So they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it . But you like Julia best . ”
16815	16824	16765	16765	he	133	“ Oh yes ! I like Julia best . ”
16825	16841	16768	16768	he	133	“ But do you really ? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest . ”
16842	16897	16765	16765	he	133	“ So I should suppose . She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ”
16898	16921	16765	16765	he	133	“ I shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you _ will _ like her best at last . ”
16922	16940	16765	16765	he	133	“ Do not I tell you that I like her best _ at _ _ first _ ? ”
16941	16962	16768	16768	he	133	“ And besides , Miss Bertram is engaged . Remember that , my dear brother . Her choice is made . ”
16963	17026	16765	16765	he	133	“ Yes , and I like her the better for it . An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged . She is satisfied with herself . Her cares are over , and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion . All is safe with a lady engaged : no harm can be done . ”
17027	17054	16765	16765	he	133	“ Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . ”
17055	17132	16765	16765	he	133	“ But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _ that _ is your opinion of your intimate friend . _ I _ do not subscribe to it . I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth . I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart . ”
17133	17142	16768	16768	he	133	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ”
17143	17167	16765	16765	he	133	“ We must leave him to himself , I believe . Talking does no good . He will be taken in at last . ”
17168	17198	16765	16765	he	133	“ But I would not have him _ taken _ _ in _ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . ”
17199	17230	16768	16768	he	133	“ Oh dear ! let him stand his chance and be taken in . It will do just as well . Everybody is taken in at some period or other . ”
17231	17240	16765	16765	he	133	“ Not always in marriage , dear Mary . ”
17241	17338	16765	16765	he	133	“ In marriage especially . With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry . Look where I will , I see that it _ is _ so ; and I feel that it _ must _ be so , when I consider that it is , of all transactions , the one in which people expect most from others , and are least honest themselves . ”
17339	17356	16765	16765	he	133	“ Ah ! You have been in a bad school for matrimony , in Hill Street . ”
17357	17444	16765	16765	he	133	“ My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business . I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse . What is this but a take in ? ”
17445	17574	16765	16765	he	133	“ My dear child , there must be a little imagination here . I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you . Depend upon it , you see but half . You see the evil , but you do not see the consolation . There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere , and we are all apt to expect too much ; but then , if one scheme of happiness fails , human nature turns to another ; if the first calculation is wrong , we make a second better : we find comfort somewhere — and those evil - minded observers , dearest Mary , who make much of a little , are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves . ”
17575	17629	16765	16765	he	133	“ Well done , sister ! I honour your _ esprit _ _ du _ _ corps _ . When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too . It would save me many a heartache . ”
17630	17670	16765	16765	he	133	“ You are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both . Mansfield shall cure you both , and without any taking in . Stay with us , and we will cure you . ”
18363	18376	18382	18382	she	127	“ I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price , ”
18390	18443	18382	18382	she	127	“ Pray , is she out , or is she not ? I am puzzled . She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _ out _ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _ is _ . ”
18455	18500	18444	18444	Edmund	108	“ I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question . My cousin is grown up . She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me . ”
18501	18726	18382	18382	she	127	“ And yet , in general , nothing can be more easily ascertained . The distinction is so broad . Manners as well as appearance are , generally speaking , so totally different . Till now , I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl ’s being out or not . A girl not out has always the same sort of dress : a close bonnet , for instance ; looks very demure , and never says a word . You may smile , but it is so , I assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper . Girls should be quiet and modest . The most objectionable part is , that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden . They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite — to confidence ! _ That _ is the faulty part of the present system . One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing — and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before . Mr. Bertram , I dare say _ you _ have sometimes met with such changes . ”
18727	18754	18382	18382	she	127	“ I believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at . You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ”
18755	18802	18444	18444	Edmund	108	“ No , indeed . Miss Anderson ! I do not know who or what you mean . I am quite in the dark . But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about . ”
18803	19097	18382	18382	she	127	“ Ah ! you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed on . You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye , in describing an altered young lady . You paint too accurately for mistake . It was exactly so . The Andersons of Baker Street . We were speaking of them the other day , you know . Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson . The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it . When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _ out _ , and I could not get her to speak to me . I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady — nothing like a civil answer — she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air ! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth . She was then _ out _ . I met her at Mrs. Holford ’s , and did not recollect her . She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story . ”
19098	19175	18382	18382	she	127	“ And a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , I dare say , than does credit to Miss Anderson . It is too common a fault . Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters . I do not know where the error lies . I do not pretend to set people right , but I do see that they are often wrong . ”
19176	19191	19193	19194	Mr. Bertram	108	“ Those who are showing the world what female manners _ should _ be , ”
19197	19208	19193	19194	Mr. Bertram	108	“ are doing a great deal to set them right . ”
19209	19216	19221	19221	Edmund	108	“ The error is plain enough , ”
19223	19269	19221	19221	Edmund	108	“ such girls are ill brought up . They are given wrong notions from the beginning . They are always acting upon motives of vanity , and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour _ before _ they appear in public than afterwards . ”
19270	19276	19278	19279	Miss Crawford	127	“ I do not know , ”
19282	19342	18382	18382	she	127	“ Yes , I can not agree with you there . It is certainly the modestest part of the business . It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were , which I have seen done . That is worse than anything — quite disgusting ! ”
19343	19354	19356	19357	Mr. Bertram	108	“ Yes , _ that _ is very inconvenient indeed , ”
19359	19649	19356	19357	Mr. Bertram	108	“ It leads one astray ; one does not know what to do . The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them . I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September , just after my return from the West Indies . My friend Sneyd — you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund — his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me . When we reached Albion Place they were out ; we went after them , and found them on the pier : Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds , with others of their acquaintance . I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen . I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong . They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _ out _ , and had most excessively offended the eldest . Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me . ”
19650	19743	18382	18382	she	127	“ That was bad indeed . Poor Miss Sneyd . Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her . To be neglected before one ’s time must be very vexatious ; but it was entirely the mother ’s fault . Miss Augusta should have been with her governess . Such half - and - half doings never prosper . But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price . Does she go to balls ? Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ”
19744	19747	19749	19749	Edmund	108	“ No , ”
19751	19790	19749	19749	Edmund	108	“ I do not think she has ever been to a ball . My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _ her _ . ”
19791	19806	18382	18382	she	127	“ Oh ! then the point is clear . Miss Price is not out . ”
19959	19966	19967	19967	She	127	“ my friend such a one . ”
20151	20159	20161	20161	he	113	“ I wish you could see Compton , ”
20163	20242	20161	20161	he	113	“ it is the most complete thing ! I never saw a place so altered in my life . I told Smith I did not know where I was . The approach _ now _ , is one of the finest things in the country : you see the house in the most surprising manner . I declare , when I got back to Sotherton yesterday , it looked like a prison — quite a dismal old prison . ”
20243	20249	20251	20252	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Oh , for shame ! ”
20254	20270	20251	20252	Mrs. Norris	105	“ A prison indeed ? Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world . ”
20271	20312	20161	20161	he	113	“ It wants improvement , ma’am , beyond anything . I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life ; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it . ”
20313	20325	20327	20328	Mrs. Grant	123	“ No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present , ”
20337	20358	20161	20161	he	113	“ but depend upon it , Sotherton will have _ every _ improvement in time which his heart can desire . ”
20359	20369	20371	20372	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ I must try to do something with it , ”
20374	20394	20371	20372	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ but I do not know what . I hope I shall have some good friend to help me . ”
20395	20404	20406	20407	Miss Bertram	112	“ Your best friend upon such an occasion , ”
20410	20419	20406	20407	Miss Bertram	112	“ would be Mr. Repton , I imagine . ”
20420	20456	20470	20471	Mrs. Norris	105	“ That is what I was thinking of . As he has done so well by Smith , I think I had better have him at once . His terms are five guineas a day . ”
20457	20468	20470	20471	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Well , and if they were _ ten _ , ”
20473	20833	20835	20835	herself	814	“ I am sure _ you _ need not regard it . The expense need not be any impediment . If I were you , I should not think of the expense . I would have everything done in the best style , and made as nice as possible . Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do . You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it . It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre . It would be quite a burlesque . But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting . We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it . You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris ’s sad state of health . He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and _ that _ disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of . If it had not been for _ that _ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done . We were always doing something as it was . It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris ’s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall , which is now grown such a noble tree , and getting to such perfection , sir , ”
20841	20853	20855	20856	Dr. Grant	121	“ The tree thrives well , beyond a doubt , madam , ”
20858	20884	20855	20856	Dr. Grant	121	“ The soil is good ; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering . ”
20885	20940	20951	20952	Dr. Grant	121	“ Sir , it is a Moor Park , we bought it as a Moor Park , and it cost us — that is , it was a present from Sir Thomas , but I saw the bill — and I know it cost seven shillings , and was charged as a Moor Park . ”
20941	20949	20951	20952	Dr. Grant	121	“ You were imposed on , ma’am , ”
20954	20997	20951	20952	Dr. Grant	121	“ these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree . It is an insipid fruit at the best ; but a good apricot is eatable , which none from my garden are . ”
20998	21005	21007	21008	Mrs. Grant	123	“ The truth is , ma’am , ”
21020	21083	21017	21018	Mrs. Norris	105	“ that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all . ”
21146	21178	21141	21142	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ Smith ’s place is the admiration of all the country ; and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand . I think I shall have Repton . ”
21179	21183	21185	21186	Lady Bertram	106	“ Mr. Rushworth , ”
21188	21214	21185	21186	Lady Bertram	106	“ if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather . ”
21330	21465	21472	21472	he	821	“ Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds , which is little enough , and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved . Now , at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred , without reckoning the water meadows ; so that I think , if so much could be done at Compton , we need not despair . There have been two or three fine old trees cut down , that grew too near the house , and it opens the prospect amazingly , which makes me think that Repton , or anybody of that sort , would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down : the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill , you know , ”
21485	21505	21506	21506	Fanny	113	“ The avenue ! Oh ! I do not recollect it . I really know very little of Sotherton . ”
21542	21575	21576	21576	He	821	“ Cut down an avenue ! What a pity ! Does it not make you think of Cowper ? ‘ Ye fallen avenues , once more I mourn your fate unmerited . ’ ”
21582	21595	21576	21576	He	821	“ I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance , Fanny . ”
21596	21631	21576	21576	He	821	“ I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down , to see the place as it is now , in its old state ; but I do not suppose I shall . ”
21632	21665	21576	21576	He	821	“ Have you never been there ? No , you never can ; and , unluckily , it is out of distance for a ride . I wish we could contrive it . ”
21666	21690	21576	21576	He	821	“ Oh ! it does not signify . Whenever I do see it , you will tell me how it has been altered . ”
21691	21695	21697	21698	Miss Crawford	127	“ I collect , ”
21700	21722	21697	21698	Miss Crawford	127	“ that Sotherton is an old place , and a place of some grandeur . In any particular style of building ? ”
21723	21838	21576	21576	He	821	“ The house was built in Elizabeth ’s time , and is a large , regular , brick building ; heavy , but respectable looking , and has many good rooms . It is ill placed . It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park ; in that respect , unfavourable for improvement . But the woods are fine , and there is a stream , which , I dare say , might be made a good deal of . Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well . ”
21850	21866	21848	21848	herself	127	“ He is a well - bred man ; he makes the best of it . ”
21867	21877	21878	21878	he	822	“ I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth , ”
21881	21935	21878	21878	he	822	“ but , had I a place to new fashion , I should not put myself into the hands of an improver . I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty , of my own choice , and acquired progressively . I would rather abide by my own blunders than by his . ”
21936	22027	21848	21848	herself	127	“ _ You _ would know what you were about , of course ; but that would not suit _ me _ . I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters , but as they are before me ; and had I a place of my own in the country , I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it , and give me as much beauty as he could for my money ; and I should never look at it till it was complete . ”
22028	22045	22047	22047	Fanny	113	“ It would be delightful to _ me _ to see the progress of it all , ”
22049	22225	22047	22047	Fanny	113	“ Ay , you have been brought up to it . It was no part of my education ; and the only dose I ever had , being administered by not the first favourite in the world , has made me consider improvements _ in _ _ hand _ as the greatest of nuisances . Three years ago the Admiral , my honoured uncle , bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in ; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures ; but it being excessively pretty , it was soon found necessary to be improved , and for three months we were all dirt and confusion , without a gravel walk to step on , or a bench fit for use . I would have everything as complete as possible in the country , shrubberies and flower - gardens , and rustic seats innumerable : but it must all be done without my care . Henry is different ; he loves to be doing . ”
22279	22283	22285	22285	she	127	“ Mr. Bertram , ”
22287	22332	22285	22285	she	127	“ I have tidings of my harp at last . I am assured that it is safe at Northampton ; and there it has probably been these ten days , in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary . ”
22340	22417	22333	22333	Edmund	108	“ The truth is , that our inquiries were too direct ; we sent a servant , we went ourselves : this will not do seventy miles from London ; but this morning we heard of it in the right way . It was seen by some farmer , and he told the miller , and the miller told the butcher , and the butcher ’s son - in - law left word at the shop . ”
22418	22443	22285	22285	she	127	“ I am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and hope there will be no further delay . ”
22444	22498	22285	22285	she	127	“ I am to have it to - morrow ; but how do you think it is to be conveyed ? Not by a wagon or cart : oh no ! nothing of that kind could be hired in the village . I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow . ”
22499	22530	22285	22285	she	127	“ You would find it difficult , I dare say , just now , in the middle of a very late hay harvest , to hire a horse and cart ? ”
22531	22710	22285	22285	she	127	“ I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it ! To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so I told my maid to speak for one directly ; and as I can not look out of my dressing - closet without seeing one farmyard , nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another , I thought it would be only ask and have , and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all . Guess my surprise , when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable , most impossible thing in the world ; had offended all the farmers , all the labourers , all the hay in the parish ! As for Dr. Grant ’s bailiff , I believe I had better keep out of _ his _ way ; and my brother - in - law himself , who is all kindness in general , looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at . ”
22711	22793	22285	22285	she	127	“ You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before ; but when you _ do _ think of it , you must see the importance of getting in the grass . The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose : our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out ; but , in harvest , it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse . ”
22794	22877	22285	22285	she	127	“ I shall understand all your ways in time ; but , coming down with the true London maxim , that everything is to be got with money , I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs . However , I am to have my harp fetched to - morrow . Henry , who is good - nature itself , has offered to fetch it in his barouche . Will it not be honourably conveyed ? ”
22914	22926	22928	22929	Miss Crawford	127	“ I shall be most happy to play to you both , ”
22931	23048	22928	22929	Miss Crawford	127	“ at least as long as you can like to listen : probably much longer , for I dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off , for she is gratified in more ways than one . Now , Mr. Bertram , if you write to your brother , I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come : he heard so much of my misery about it . And you may say , if you please , that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return , in compassion to his feelings , as I know his horse will lose . ”
23049	23076	22285	22285	she	127	“ If I write , I will say whatever you wish me ; but I do not , at present , foresee any occasion for writing . ”
23077	23276	22928	22929	Miss Crawford	127	“ No , I dare say , nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth , would you ever write to him , nor he to you , if it could be helped . The occasion would never be foreseen . What strange creatures brothers are ! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world ; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill , or such a relation dead , it is done in the fewest possible words . You have but one style among you . I know it perfectly . Henry , who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be , who loves me , consults me , confides in me , and will talk to me by the hour together , has never yet turned the page in a letter ; and very often it is nothing more than—‘Dear Mary , I am just arrived . Bath seems full , and everything as usual . Yours sincerely . ’ That is the true manly style ; that is a complete brother ’s letter . ”
23277	23289	23291	23291	Fanny	113	“ When they are at a distance from all their family , ”
23299	23306	23291	23291	Fanny	113	“ they can write long letters . ”
23307	23316	23318	23318	Edmund	108	“ Miss Price has a brother at sea , ”
23320	23335	23318	23318	Edmund	108	“ whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us . ”
23336	23352	23353	23353	Fanny	113	“ At sea , has she ? In the king ’s service , of course ? ”
23424	23435	23437	23437	Edmund	108	“ Do you know anything of my cousin ’s captain ? ”
23439	23455	23437	23437	Edmund	108	“ Captain Marshall ? You have a large acquaintance in the navy , I conclude ? ”
23456	23465	23396	23396	she	825	“ Among admirals , large enough ; but , ”
23472	23597	23598	23598	Edmund	108	“ we know very little of the inferior ranks . Post - captains may be very good sort of men , but they do not belong to _ us _ . Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal : of them and their flags , and the gradation of their pay , and their bickerings and jealousies . But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used . Certainly , my home at my uncle ’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals . Of _ Rears _ and _ Vices _ I saw enough . Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat . ”
23607	23614	23598	23598	Edmund	108	“ It is a noble profession . ”
23615	23667	23396	23396	she	825	“ Yes , the profession is well enough under two circumstances : if it make the fortune , and there be discretion in spending it ; but , in short , it is not a favourite profession of mine . It has never worn an amiable form to _ me _ . ”
23724	23809	23720	23722	Miss Julia Bertram	112	“ My dear Henry , have _ you _ nothing to say ? You have been an improver yourself , and from what I hear of Everingham , it may vie with any place in England . Its natural beauties , I am sure , are great . Everingham , as it _ used _ to be , was perfect in my estimation : such a happy fall of ground , and such timber ! What would I not give to see it again ! ”
23810	23826	23828	23828	his	830	“ Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it , ”
23831	23897	23828	23828	his	830	“ but I fear there would be some disappointment : you would not find it equal to your present ideas . In extent , it is a mere nothing ; you would be surprised at its insignificance ; and , as for improvement , there was very little for me to do — too little : I should like to have been busy much longer . ”
23898	23908	23910	23910	Julia	112	“ You are fond of the sort of thing ? ”
23912	24016	23910	23910	Julia	112	“ Excessively ; but what with the natural advantages of the ground , which pointed out , even to a very young eye , what little remained to be done , and my own consequent resolutions , I had not been of age three months before Everingham was all that it is now . My plan was laid at Westminster , a little altered , perhaps , at Cambridge , and at one - and - twenty executed . I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him . I have been a devourer of my own . ”
24017	24031	24033	24033	Julia	112	“ Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , ”
24035	24058	24033	24033	Julia	112	“ _ You _ can never want employment . Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth , you should assist him with your opinion . ”
24232	24441	24201	24202	Mrs. Norris	105	“ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? Why should not we make a little party ? Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight . I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you . ”
24476	24492	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _ now _ ? ”
24508	24516	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ How did you like her yesterday ? ”
24517	24552	24201	24202	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Very well — very much . I like to hear her talk . She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her . ”
24553	24589	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ It is her countenance that is so attractive . She has a wonderful play of feature ! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? ”
24590	24659	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ Oh yes ! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did . I was quite astonished . An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son . I could not have believed it ! ”
24660	24676	24201	24202	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I thought you would be struck . It was very wrong ; very indecorous . ”
24677	24685	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ And very ungrateful , I think . ”
24686	24833	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ Ungrateful is a strong word . I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _ gratitude _ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’s memory which misleads her here . She is awkwardly circumstanced . With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford , without throwing a shade on the Admiral . I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely . I do not censure her _ opinions _ ; but there certainly _ is _ impropriety in making them public . ”
24834	24840	24842	24842	Fanny	113	“ Do not you think , ”
24849	24888	24842	24842	Fanny	113	“ that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? She can not have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral . ”
24889	24962	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ That is a fair remark . Yes , we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt ; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under . But I think her present home must do her good . Mrs. Grant ’s manners are just what they ought to be . She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection . ”
24963	25058	24494	24494	Edmund	108	“ Yes , except as to his writing her such short letters . She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated . I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances . And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ”
25059	25153	24842	24842	Fanny	113	“ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of . There she can not be justified . I am glad you saw it all as I did . ”
26747	26753	26755	26756	Miss Crawford	127	“ My dear Miss Price , ”
26768	26839	26761	26761	she	127	“ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ”
26860	26881	26883	26883	he	108	“ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ”
26885	26949	26883	26883	he	108	“ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then . I wish _ you _ may not be fatigued by so much exercise . I wish you had saved yourself this walk home . ”
26950	26967	26969	26969	she	127	“ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ”
26979	27041	26969	26969	she	127	“ I am very strong . Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like . Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . ”
27141	27158	27160	27160	he	892	“ It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding ! ”
27162	27219	27160	27160	he	892	“ I never see one sit a horse better . She did not seem to have a thought of fear . Very different from you , miss , when you first began , six years ago come next Easter . Lord bless you ! how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! ”
27278	27287	27289	27289	Julia	112	“ I was sure she would ride well , ”
27291	27309	27289	27289	Julia	112	“ she has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother ’s . ”
27310	27313	27315	27315	Maria	126	“ Yes , ”
27317	27352	27315	27315	Maria	126	“ and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . ”
27370	27385	27387	27387	her	127	“ No , I do not know — not if you want the mare , ”
27390	27401	27403	27403	he	108	“ I do not want her at all for myself , ”
27405	27517	27403	27403	he	108	“ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short . She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . But any morning will do for this . She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you . It would be very wrong if she did . _ She _ rides only for pleasure ; _ you _ for health . ”
27518	27529	27531	27531	Fanny	113	“ I shall not ride to - morrow , certainly , ”
27533	27561	27531	27531	Fanny	113	“ I have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home . You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . ”
28025	28037	28018	28018	Edmund	108	“ But where is Fanny ? Is she gone to bed ? ”
28038	28047	28049	28050	Mrs. Norris	105	“ No , not that I know of , ”
28052	28060	28061	28061	Her	105	“ she was here a moment ago . ”
28095	28216	28090	28091	Mrs. Norris	105	“ That is a very foolish trick , Fanny , to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa . Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as _ we _ do ? If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket . There is all the new calico , that was bought last week , not touched yet . I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out . You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ”
28266	28287	28242	28242	Julia	112	“ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ”
28288	28291	28293	28293	Edmund	108	“ Fanny , ”
28301	28310	28293	28293	Edmund	108	“ I am sure you have the headache . ”
28325	28332	28333	28333	he	108	“ I can hardly believe you , ”
28336	28351	28333	28333	he	108	“ I know your looks too well . How long have you had it ? ”
28352	28366	28242	28242	Julia	112	“ Since a little before dinner . It is nothing but the heat . ”
28367	28376	28333	28333	he	108	“ Did you go out in the heat ? ”
28377	28387	28389	28390	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Go out ! to be sure she did , ”
28392	28427	28389	28390	Mrs. Norris	105	“ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? Were not we _ all _ out ? Even your mother was out to - day for above an hour . ”
28428	28435	28437	28438	her ladyship	921	“ Yes , indeed , Edmund , ”
28454	28515	28446	28447	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I was out above an hour . I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot . It was shady enough in the alcove , but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again . ”
28516	28526	28389	28390	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Fanny has been cutting roses , has she ? ”
28527	28566	28446	28447	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Yes , and I am afraid they will be the last this year . Poor thing ! _ She _ found it hot enough ; but they were so full - blown that one could not wait . ”
28567	28577	28579	28580	Mrs. Norris	105	“ There was no help for it , certainly , ”
28588	28651	28579	28580	Mrs. Norris	105	“ but I question whether her headache might not be caught _ then _ , sister . There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun ; but I dare say it will be well to - morrow . Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled . ”
28652	28658	28660	28661	Lady Bertram	106	“ She has got it , ”
28663	28680	28660	28661	Lady Bertram	106	“ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ”
28681	28684	28686	28686	Edmund	108	“ What ! ”
28688	28721	28686	28686	Edmund	108	“ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ? No wonder her head aches . ”
28734	28746	28748	28749	Lady Bertram	106	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ”
28751	28776	28748	28749	Lady Bertram	106	“ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home . ”
28777	28790	28660	28661	Lady Bertram	106	“ But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? ”
28791	28834	28835	28835	Edmund	108	“ No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again . ”
28846	28875	28835	28835	Edmund	108	“ And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ? Upon my word , ma’am , it has been a very ill - managed business . ”
28876	28893	28895	28896	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , ”
28904	29062	28895	28896	Mrs. Norris	105	“ unless I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother ’s dairymaid , by _ her _ desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ? ”
29063	29074	28835	28835	Edmund	108	“ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ”
29075	29191	28895	28896	Mrs. Norris	105	“ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon . She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk . If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her . But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot . Between ourselves , Edmund , ”
29198	29219	28895	28896	Mrs. Norris	105	“ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . ”
29220	29229	29234	29235	Lady Bertram	106	“ I am afraid it was , indeed , ”
29242	29297	29234	29235	Lady Bertram	106	“ I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody . It was as much as I could bear myself . Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower - beds , was almost too much for me . ”
29982	30123	29967	29968	Mrs. Norris	105	“ The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . Ten miles there , and ten back , you know . You must excuse my sister on this occasion , and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her . Sotherton is the only place that could give her a _ wish _ to go so far , but it can not be , indeed . She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . He can go on horseback , you know . ”
30143	30195	29967	29968	Mrs. Norris	105	“ The loss of her ladyship ’s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , and it was a pity she should not see the place . ”
30196	30211	30213	30214	Mrs. Norris	105	“ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ”
30216	30258	30213	30214	Mrs. Norris	105	“ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . ”
30259	30270	30271	30272	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ Oh no ! I can not do without Fanny . ”
30487	30494	30496	30496	Edmund	108	“ But why is it necessary , ”
30498	30560	30496	30496	Edmund	108	“ that Crawford ’s carriage , or his _ only _ , should be employed ? Why is no use to be made of my mother ’s chaise ? I could not , when the scheme was first mentioned the other day , understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family . ”
30561	30564	30566	30566	Julia	112	“ What ! ”
30568	30601	30566	30566	Julia	112	“ go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do . ”
30602	30605	30607	30607	Maria	126	“ Besides , ”
30609	30634	30607	30607	Maria	126	“ I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . ”
30635	30642	30644	30645	Mrs. Norris	105	“ And , my dear Edmund , ”
30647	30722	30644	30645	Mrs. Norris	105	“ taking out _ two _ carriages when _ one _ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . ”
30723	30738	30740	30740	Maria	126	“ That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford ’s , ”
30742	30781	30740	30740	Maria	126	“ but the truth is , that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow , and does not know how to drive . I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday . ”
30782	30794	30796	30796	Edmund	108	“ There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , ”
30798	30806	30796	30796	Edmund	108	“ in going on the barouche box . ”
30807	30810	30812	30812	Maria	126	“ Unpleasant ! ”
30814	30854	30812	30812	Maria	126	“ oh dear ! I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat . There can be no comparison as to one ’s view of the country . Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche - box herself . ”
30855	30883	30796	30796	Edmund	108	“ There can be no objection , then , to Fanny ’s going with you ; there can be no doubt of your having room for her . ”
30884	30887	30889	30890	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Fanny ! ”
30892	30924	30889	30890	Mrs. Norris	105	“ my dear Edmund , there is no idea of her going with us . She stays with her aunt . I told Mrs. Rushworth so . She is not expected . ”
30925	30937	30939	30939	he	950	“ You can have no reason , I imagine , madam , ”
30945	30987	30939	30939	he	950	“ for wishing Fanny _ not _ to be of the party , but as it relates to yourself , to your own comfort . If you could do without her , you would not wish to keep her at home ? ”
30988	31004	30889	30890	Mrs. Norris	105	“ To be sure not , but I _ can not _ do without her . ”
31005	31023	30889	30890	Mrs. Norris	105	“ You can , if I stay at home with you , as I mean to do . ”
31033	31036	31037	31037	he	950	“ Yes , ”
31040	31102	31037	31037	he	950	“ there is no necessity for my going , and I mean to stay at home . Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton . I know she wishes it very much . She has not often a gratification of the kind , and I am sure , ma’am , you would be glad to give her the pleasure now ? ”
31103	31117	31118	31119	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Oh yes ! very glad , if your aunt sees no objection . ”
31380	31408	31361	31362	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Very well , very well , just as you chuse , settle it your own way , I am sure I do not care about it . ”
31409	31415	31417	31417	Maria	126	“ It seems very odd , ”
31419	31431	31417	31417	Maria	126	“ that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ”
31432	31446	31448	31448	Julia	112	“ I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ”
31472	31484	31486	31486	Edmund	108	“ Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires , ”
31808	31857	31802	31802	she	123	“ As there are five of you , it will be better that one should sit with Henry ; and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive , Julia , I think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson . ”
32155	32159	32191	32192	Mr. Crawford	133	“ there he is ”
32278	32295	32266	32266	she	112	“ her view of the country was charming , she wished they could all see it , ”
32329	32363	32308	32309	Miss Crawford	127	“ Here is a fine burst of country . I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; ”
32444	32451	32452	32452	she	112	“ those woods belonged to Sotherton , ”
32458	32477	32452	32452	she	112	“ she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth ’s property on each side of the road , ”
32520	32745	32746	32747	Miss Crawford	127	“ Now we shall have no more rough road , Miss Crawford ; our difficulties are over . The rest of the way is such as it ought to be . Mr. Rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate . Here begins the village . Those cottages are really a disgrace . The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome . I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places . The annoyance of the bells must be terrible . There is the parsonage : a tidy - looking house , and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people . Those are almshouses , built by some of the family . To the right is the steward ’s house ; he is a very respectable man . Now we are coming to the lodge - gates ; but we have nearly a mile through the park still . It is not ugly , you see , at this end ; there is some fine timber , but the situation of the house is dreadful . We go down hill to it for half a mile , and it is a pity , for it would not be an ill - looking place if it had a better approach . ”
32831	32848	32849	32849	she	112	“ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ”
32852	32890	32849	32849	she	112	“ Now , where is the avenue ? The house fronts the east , I perceive . The avenue , therefore , must be at the back of it . Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front . ”
32891	32940	32849	32849	she	112	“ Yes , it is exactly behind the house ; begins at a little distance , and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds . You may see something of it here — something of the more distant trees . It is oak entirely . ”
33163	33190	33191	33192	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments , might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure . ”
33591	33594	33596	33597	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ Now , ”
33599	33643	33596	33597	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ we are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me . ”
33700	33705	33707	33707	she	1031	“ I am disappointed , ”
33717	33781	33707	33707	she	1031	“ This is not my idea of a chapel . There is nothing awful here , nothing melancholy , nothing grand . Here are no aisles , no arches , no inscriptions , no banners . No banners , cousin , to be ‘ blown by the night wind of heaven . ’ No signs that a ‘ Scottish monarch sleeps below . ’ ”
33782	33850	33707	33707	she	1031	“ You forget , Fanny , how lately all this has been built , and for how confined a purpose , compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries . It was only for the private use of the family . They have been buried , I suppose , in the parish church . _ There _ you must look for the banners and the achievements . ”
33851	33869	33873	33873	her	126	“ It was foolish of me not to think of all that ; but I am disappointed . ”
33876	33981	33870	33871	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ This chapel was fitted up as you see it , in James the Second ’s time . Before that period , as I understand , the pews were only wainscot ; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth ; but this is not quite certain . It is a handsome chapel , and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening . Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain , within the memory of many ; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off . ”
33982	33989	33991	33992	Miss Crawford	127	“ Every generation has its improvements , ”
34027	34033	34035	34035	Fanny	113	“ It is a pity , ”
34037	34097	34035	34035	Fanny	113	“ that the custom should have been discontinued . It was a valuable part of former times . There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house , with one ’s ideas of what such a household should be ! A whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine ! ”
34098	34103	34105	34106	Miss Crawford	127	“ Very fine indeed , ”
34110	34157	34105	34106	Miss Crawford	127	“ It must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure , and say their prayers here twice a day , while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away . ”
34158	34172	34174	34174	Edmund	108	“ _ That _ is hardly Fanny ’s idea of a family assembling , ”
34176	34200	34174	34174	Edmund	108	“ If the master and mistress do _ not _ attend themselves , there must be more harm than good in the custom . ”
34201	34405	34410	34410	she	1034	“ At any rate , it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects . Everybody likes to go their own way — to chuse their own time and manner of devotion . The obligation of attendance , the formality , the restraint , the length of time — altogether it is a formidable thing , and what nobody likes ; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed , when they woke with a headache , without danger of reprobation , because chapel was missed , they would have jumped with joy and envy . Can not you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel ? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets — starched up into seeming piety , but with heads full of something very different — especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at — and , in those days , I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now . ”
34439	34556	34435	34435	he	108	“ Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects . You have given us an amusing sketch , and human nature can not say it was not so . We must all feel _ at _ _ times _ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish ; but if you are supposing it a frequent thing , that is to say , a weakness grown into a habit from neglect , what could be expected from the _ private _ devotions of such persons ? Do you think the minds which are suffered , which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel , would be more collected in a closet ? ”
34557	34594	34706	34706	Julia	112	“ Yes , very likely . They would have two chances at least in their favour . There would be less to distract the attention from without , and it would not be tried so long . ”
34595	34689	34435	34435	he	108	“ The mind which does not struggle against itself under _ one _ circumstance , would find objects to distract it in the _ other _ , I believe ; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with . The greater length of the service , however , I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind . One wishes it were not so ; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are . ”
34719	34753	34706	34706	Julia	112	“ Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria , standing side by side , exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed . Have not they completely the air of it ? ”
34777	34791	34754	34755	Mr. Crawford	133	“ I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar . ”
34825	34833	34805	34805	herself	718	“ If he would give her away ? ”
34834	34845	34847	34847	his	133	“ I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , ”
34869	34913	34915	34915	she	112	“ Upon my word , it is really a pity that it should not take place directly , if we had but a proper licence , for here we are altogether , and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant . ”
34972	34980	34982	34982	Julia	112	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ”
34996	35032	34988	34988	he	133	“ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly . How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ”
35065	35078	35061	35061	Fanny	113	“ How distressed she will be at what she said just now , ”
35084	35087	35089	35090	Miss Crawford	127	“ Ordained ! ”
35092	35102	35089	35090	Miss Crawford	127	“ what , are you to be a clergyman ? ”
35103	35121	35122	35123	Miss Crawford	127	“ Yes ; I shall take orders soon after my father ’s return — probably at Christmas . ”
35137	35156	35089	35090	Miss Crawford	127	“ If I had known this before , I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect , ”
35265	35269	35271	35271	he	637	“ For if , ”
35291	35331	35332	35333	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ we are _ too _ long going over the house , we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors . It is past two , and we are to dine at five . ”
35429	35439	35441	35442	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ Suppose we turn down here for the present , ”
35452	35469	35441	35442	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ Here are the greatest number of our plants , and here are the curious pheasants . ”
35470	35473	35475	35476	Mr. Crawford	133	“ Query , ”
35482	35517	35475	35476	Mr. Crawford	133	“ whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ? I see walls of great promise . Mr. Rushworth , shall we summon a council on this lawn ? ”
35518	35521	35523	35524	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ James , ”
35529	35552	35523	35524	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party . The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet . ”
35946	35952	35954	35955	Miss Crawford	127	“ This is insufferably hot , ”
35985	36044	35954	35955	Miss Crawford	127	“ Shall any of us object to being comfortable ? Here is a nice little wood , if one can but get into it . What happiness if the door should not be locked ! but of course it is ; for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like . ”
36169	36189	36164	36165	Miss Crawford	127	“ So you are to be a clergyman , Mr. Bertram . This is rather a surprise to me . ”
36190	36224	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ Why should it surprise you ? You must suppose me designed for some profession , and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer , nor a soldier , nor a sailor . ”
36225	36261	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ Very true ; but , in short , it had not occurred to me . And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son . ”
36262	36268	36270	36270	Edmund	108	“ A very praiseworthy practice , ”
36272	36297	36270	36270	Edmund	108	“ but not quite universal . I am one of the exceptions , and _ being _ one , must do something for myself . ”
36298	36330	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ But why are you to be a clergyman ? I thought _ that _ was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . ”
36331	36343	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ Do you think the church itself never chosen , then ? ”
36344	36420	36270	36270	Edmund	108	“ _ Never _ is a black word . But yes , in the _ never _ of conversation , which means _ not _ _ very _ _ often _ , I do think it . For what is to be done in the church ? Men love to distinguish themselves , and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained , but not in the church . A clergyman is nothing . ”
36421	36569	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ The _ nothing _ of conversation has its gradations , I hope , as well as the _ never _ . A clergyman can not be high in state or fashion . He must not head mobs , or set the ton in dress . But I can not call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind , individually or collectively considered , temporally and eternally , which has the guardianship of religion and morals , and consequently of the manners which result from their influence . No one here can call the _ office _ nothing . If the man who holds it is so , it is by the neglect of his duty , by foregoing its just importance , and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear . ”
36570	36686	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ _ You _ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend . One does not see much of this influence and importance in society , and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves ? How can two sermons a week , even supposing them worth hearing , supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair ’s to his own , do all that you speak of ? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week ? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit . ”
36687	36707	36270	36270	Edmund	108	“ _ You _ are speaking of London , _ I _ am speaking of the nation at large . ”
36708	36724	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ The metropolis , I imagine , is a pretty fair sample of the rest . ”
36725	36992	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ Not , I should hope , of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom . We do not look in great cities for our best morality . It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good ; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt . A fine preacher is followed and admired ; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood , where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character , and observing his general conduct , which in London can rarely be the case . The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners . They are known to the largest part only as preachers . And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life . The _ manners _ I speak of might rather be called _ conduct _ , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . ”
36993	36996	36998	36998	Fanny	113	“ Certainly , ”
37004	37007	37009	37010	Miss Crawford	127	“ There , ”
37012	37021	37009	37010	Miss Crawford	127	“ you have quite convinced Miss Price already . ”
37022	37032	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . ”
37033	37042	37044	37044	she	127	“ I do not think you ever will , ”
37051	37098	37044	37044	she	127	“ I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders . You really are fit for something better . Come , do change your mind . It is not too late . Go into the law . ”
37099	37119	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ Go into the law ! With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness . ”
37120	37150	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ”
37151	37218	37044	37044	she	127	“ You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature . I am a very matter - of - fact , plain - spoken being , and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out . ”
37236	37282	37228	37228	Fanny	113	“ I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ”
37283	37288	37290	37290	Edmund	108	“ My dear Fanny , ”
37299	37316	37290	37290	Edmund	108	“ how thoughtless I have been ! I hope you are not very tired . Perhaps , ”
37322	37336	37290	37290	Edmund	108	“ my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . ”
37337	37349	37350	37350	She	1086	“ Thank you , but I am not at all tired . ”
37387	37393	37395	37395	he	108	“ You scarcely touch me , ”
37397	37457	37395	37395	he	108	“ You do not make me of any use . What a difference in the weight of a woman ’s arm from that of a man ! At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . ”
37458	37491	37357	37357	she	1086	“ I am really not tired , which I almost wonder at ; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood . Do not you think we have ? ”
37492	37498	37500	37500	his	108	“ Not half a mile , ”
37526	37582	37505	37505	he	108	“ Oh ! you do not consider how much we have wound about . We have taken such a very serpentine course , and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line , for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path . ”
37583	37634	37357	37357	she	1086	“ But if you remember , before we left that first great path , we saw directly to the end of it . We looked down the whole vista , and saw it closed by iron gates , and it could not have been more than a furlong in length . ”
37635	37693	37357	37357	she	1086	“ Oh ! I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass . ”
37694	37706	37708	37708	Edmund	108	“ We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here , ”
37715	37727	37708	37708	Edmund	108	“ Do you think we are walking four miles an hour ? ”
37728	37759	37357	37357	she	1086	“ Oh ! do not attack me with your watch . A watch is always too fast or too slow . I can not be dictated to by a watch . ”
37814	37825	37827	37827	Edmund	108	“ I am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , ”
37832	37873	37827	37827	Edmund	108	“ why would not you speak sooner ? This will be a bad day ’s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up . Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon , Miss Crawford , except riding . ”
37874	37911	38096	38096	she	127	“ How abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week ! I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ”
37912	37941	37827	37827	Edmund	108	“ _ Your _ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect . Fanny ’s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . ”
37942	38043	37827	37827	Edmund	108	“ That she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one ’s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one ’s eyes and one ’s attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for . It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ”
38044	38051	38053	38053	Fanny	113	“ I shall soon be rested , ”
38055	38077	38053	38053	Fanny	113	“ to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ”
38089	38094	38096	38096	she	127	“ I must move , ”
38098	38139	38096	38096	she	127	“ resting fatigues me . I have looked across the ha - ha till I am weary . I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . ”
38146	38180	38140	38140	Edmund	108	“ Now , Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . ”
38181	38188	38190	38190	she	127	“ It is an immense distance , ”
38192	38202	38190	38190	she	127	“ I see _ that _ with a glance . ”
38535	38540	38517	38518	Mr. Crawford	133	“ Miss Price all alone ”
38542	38551	38517	38518	Mr. Crawford	133	“ My dear Fanny , how comes this ? ”
38562	38567	38557	38557	She	127	“ Poor dear Fanny , ”
38572	38590	38557	38557	She	127	“ how ill you have been used by them ! You had better have staid with us . ”
38895	38917	38919	38920	Mr. Crawford	133	“ It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , ”
38927	38955	38919	38920	Mr. Crawford	133	“ Yes , there is nothing else to be done . But now , sincerely , do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected ? ”
38956	38993	39141	39142	Miss Bertram	112	“ No , indeed , far otherwise . I find it better , grander , more complete in its style , though that style may not be the best . And to tell you the truth , ”
38998	39030	39141	39142	Miss Bertram	112	“ I do not think that _ I _ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now . Another summer will hardly improve it to me . ”
39040	39075	39036	39037	the lady	718	“ You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world . If other people think Sotherton improved , I have no doubt that you will . ”
39076	39132	38919	38920	Mr. Crawford	133	“ I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points . My feelings are not quite so evanescent , nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world . ”
39146	39178	39141	39142	Miss Bertram	112	“ You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning . I was glad to see you so well entertained . You and Julia were laughing the whole way . ”
39179	39228	39036	39037	the lady	718	“ Were we ? Yes , I believe we were ; but I have not the least recollection at what . Oh ! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle ’s . Your sister loves to laugh . ”
39229	39241	39036	39037	the lady	718	“ You think her more light - hearted than I am ? ”
39242	39247	39248	39248	he	1108	“ More easily amused , ”
39251	39257	39248	39248	he	1108	“ consequently , you know , ”
39260	39282	39248	39248	he	1108	“ better company . I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles ’ drive . ”
39283	39305	39036	39037	the lady	718	“ Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . ”
39306	39348	39036	39037	the lady	718	“ You have , undoubtedly ; and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility . Your prospects , however , are too fair to justify want of spirits . You have a very smiling scene before you . ”
39349	39410	39412	39412	she	1109	“ Do you mean literally or figuratively ? Literally , I conclude . Yes , certainly , the sun shines , and the park looks very cheerful . But unluckily that iron gate , that ha - ha , give me a feeling of restraint and hardship . ‘ I can not get out , ’ as the starling said . ”
39431	39441	39421	39421	she	1109	“ Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key ! ”
39442	39513	39036	39037	the lady	718	“ And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr. Rushworth ’s authority and protection , or I think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate , here , with my assistance ; I think it might be done , if you really wished to be more at large , and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited . ”
39514	39551	39421	39421	she	1109	“ Prohibited ! nonsense ! I certainly can get out that way , and I will . Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment , you know ; we shall not be out of sight . ”
39552	39585	39421	39421	she	1109	“ Or if we are , Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll : the grove of oak on the knoll . ”
39605	39614	39615	39615	she	1110	“ You will hurt yourself , Miss Bertram , ”
39618	39653	39615	39615	she	1110	“ you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes ; you will tear your gown ; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha - ha . You had better not go . ”
39683	39707	39680	39680	she	1110	“ Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ”
39883	39901	39902	39902	Fanny	113	“ Heyday ! Where are the others ? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you . ”
39905	39921	39902	39902	Fanny	113	“ A pretty trick , upon my word ! I can not see them anywhere , ”
39928	39954	39902	39902	Fanny	113	“ But they can not be very far off , and I think I am equal to as much as Maria , even without help . ”
39955	39978	39902	39902	Fanny	113	“ But , Julia , Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key . Do wait for Mr. Rushworth . ”
39979	40059	39902	39902	Fanny	113	“ Not I , indeed . I have had enough of the family for one morning . Why , child , I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother . Such a penance as I have been enduring , while you were sitting here so composed and so happy ! It might have been as well , perhaps , if you had been in my place , but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes . ”
40116	40154	40090	40090	she	112	“ Yes , yes , we saw him . He was posting away as if upon life and death , and could but just spare time to tell us his errand , and where you all were . ”
40155	40169	40090	40090	she	112	“ It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing . ”
40170	40224	40226	40226	she	112	“ _ That _ is Miss Maria ’s concern . I am not obliged to punish myself for _ her _ sins . The mother I could not avoid , as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper , but the son I _ can _ get away from . ”
40377	40403	40417	40417	he	113	“ They desired me to stay — my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll , or thereabouts . ”
40404	40415	40417	40417	he	113	“ I do not believe I shall go any farther , ”
40420	40448	40417	40417	he	113	“ I see nothing of them . By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else . I have had walking enough . ”
40461	40467	40469	40469	she	1119	“ I am very sorry , ”
40471	40477	40469	40469	she	1119	“ it is very unlucky . ”
40498	40510	40512	40512	he	113	“ I think they might as well have staid for me , ”
40514	40523	40512	40512	he	113	“ Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . ”
40524	40538	40554	40554	he	113	“ I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . ”
40556	40587	40554	40554	he	113	on—“Pray , Miss Price , are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are ? For my part , I can see nothing in him . ”
40588	40598	40512	40512	he	113	“ I do not think him at all handsome . ”
40599	40661	40554	40554	he	113	“ Handsome ! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome . He is not five foot nine . I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . I think he is an ill - looking fellow . In my opinion , these Crawfords are no addition at all . We did very well without them . ”
40679	40710	40670	40670	she	1120	“ If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key , there might have been some excuse , but I went the very moment she said she wanted it . ”
40711	40780	40781	40781	He	1121	“ Nothing could be more obliging than your manner , I am sure , and I dare say you walked as fast as you could ; but still it is some distance , you know , from this spot to the house , quite into the house ; and when people are waiting , they are bad judges of time , and every half minute seems like five . ”
40792	40805	40781	40781	He	1121	“ wished he had had the key about him at the time . ”
40832	40885	40827	40827	she	1120	“ It is a pity you should not join them . They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park , and will be thinking how it may be improved ; and nothing of that sort , you know , can be settled without you . ”
40906	40909	40911	40911	he	113	“ Well , ”
40913	40934	40911	40911	he	113	“ if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . ”
41746	41771	41738	41739	Mr. Crawford	133	“ I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ”
41874	41892	41894	41895	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ”
41904	41946	41894	41895	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end ! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . A pretty good day ’s amusement you have had ! ”
41956	41995	41947	41947	Maria	126	“ I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma’am . Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ”
41996	42183	41894	41895	Mrs. Norris	105	“ My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly . There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner . Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses . I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with . That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure ! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns . Take care of the cheese , Fanny . Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well . ”
42184	42192	42194	42194	Maria	126	“ What else have you been spunging ? ”
42206	42342	42194	42194	Maria	126	“ Spunging , my dear ! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants ’ eggs , which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me : she would not take a denial . She said it must be such an amusement to me , as she understood I lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort ; and so to be sure it will . I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them . And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some . ”
42892	42905	42878	42878	she	127	“ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks ! He is thinking of November . ”
42920	42932	42910	42911	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ Your father ’s return will be a very interesting event . ”
42933	42956	42878	42878	she	127	“ It will , indeed , after such an absence ; an absence not only long , but including so many dangers . ”
42957	42979	42878	42878	she	127	“ It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister ’s marriage , and your taking orders . ”
42980	42983	42910	42911	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ Yes . ”
42984	42990	42992	42992	she	127	“ Do n’t be affronted , ”
42996	43033	42992	42992	she	127	“ but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . ”
43034	43043	43045	43045	Edmund	108	“ There is no sacrifice in the case , ”
43059	43067	43045	43045	Edmund	108	“ it is entirely her own doing . ”
43068	43117	42878	42878	she	127	“ Oh yes I know it is . I was merely joking . She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy . My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . ”
43118	43136	42878	42878	she	127	“ My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria ’s marrying . ”
43137	43169	43045	43045	Edmund	108	“ It is fortunate that your inclination and your father ’s convenience should accord so well . There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . ”
43170	43178	42878	42878	she	127	“ Which you suppose has biassed me ? ”
43179	43191	43193	43193	Fanny	113	“ But _ that _ I am sure it has not , ”
43195	43328	43193	43193	Fanny	113	“ Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me . Nor can I think it wrong that it should . There was no natural disinclination to be overcome , and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life . I was in safe hands . I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it . I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly . ”
43329	43338	43340	43340	Fanny	113	“ It is the same sort of thing , ”
43347	43411	43340	43340	Fanny	113	“ as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . ”
43412	43472	42878	42878	she	127	“ No , my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good . The profession , either navy or army , is its own justification . It has everything in its favour : heroism , danger , bustle , fashion . Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society . Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors . ”
43473	43496	43498	43498	Edmund	108	“ But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? ”
43500	43521	43498	43498	Edmund	108	“ To be justified in your eyes , he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision . ”
43522	43541	42878	42878	she	127	“ What ! take orders without a living ! No ; that is madness indeed ; absolute madness . ”
43542	43659	42878	42878	she	127	“ Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ? No ; for you certainly would not know what to say . But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument . As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . ”
43660	43795	43498	43498	Edmund	108	“ Oh ! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made , to the trouble of working for one ; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat , drink , and grow fat . It is indolence , Mr. Bertram , indeed . Indolence and love of ease ; a want of all laudable ambition , of taste for good company , or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable , which make men clergymen . A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish — read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . ”
43796	43913	42878	42878	she	127	“ There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character . I suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing . It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy . You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively . You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle ’s table . ”
43914	43965	42878	42878	she	127	“ I speak what appears to me the general opinion ; and where an opinion is general , it is usually correct . Though _ I _ have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen , it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information . ”
43966	44027	43498	43498	Edmund	108	“ Where any one body of educated men , of whatever denomination , are condemned indiscriminately , there must be a deficiency of information , or ( smiling ) of something else . Your uncle , and his brother admirals , perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom , good or bad , they were always wishing away . ”
44028	44045	42878	42878	she	127	“ Poor William ! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp , ”
44069	44084	44086	44087	Miss Crawford	127	“ I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ”
44089	44284	44086	44087	Miss Crawford	127	“ that I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife . To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . ”
44285	44352	42878	42878	she	127	“ I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word . It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours . Fanny , it goes against us . We can not attempt to defend Dr. Grant . ”
44353	44356	44358	44358	Fanny	113	“ No , ”
44360	44607	44358	44358	Fanny	113	“ but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman . Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now . A man — a sensible man like Dr. Grant , can not be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week , can not go to church twice every Sunday , and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does , without being the better for it himself . It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . ”
44608	44681	42878	42878	she	127	“ We can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . ”
44682	44694	44696	44696	Edmund	108	“ I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , ”
44699	44709	44696	44696	Edmund	108	“ must be beyond the reach of any sermons . ”
44731	44747	44718	44719	Miss Crawford	127	“ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ”
44799	44810	44812	44812	he	108	“ There goes good - humour , I am sure , ”
44815	44855	44856	44856	he	108	“ There goes a temper which would never give pain ! How well she walks ! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others ! joining them the moment she is asked . What a pity , ”
44865	44875	44856	44856	he	108	“ that she should have been in such hands ! ”
44955	44960	44962	44962	she	127	“ Here ’s harmony ! ”
44964	45063	44962	44962	she	127	“ here ’s repose ! Here ’s what may leave all painting and all music behind , and what poetry only can attempt to describe ! Here ’s what may tranquillise every care , and lift the heart to rapture ! When I look out on such a night as this , I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world ; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to , and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene . ”
45064	45126	44950	44950	Fanny	113	“ I like to hear your enthusiasm , Fanny . It is a lovely night , and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel , in some degree , as you do ; who have not , at least , been given a taste for Nature in early life . They lose a great deal . ”
45127	45143	45285	45286	the singers	1166	“ _ You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . ”
45144	45159	44962	44962	she	127	“ I had a very apt scholar . There ’s Arcturus looking very bright . ”
45160	45174	44950	44950	Fanny	113	“ Yes , and the Bear . I wish I could see Cassiopeia . ”
45175	45191	44950	44950	Fanny	113	“ We must go out on the lawn for that . Should you be afraid ? ”
45192	45212	45285	45286	the singers	1166	“ Not in the least . It is a great while since we have had any star - gazing . ”
45213	45225	44950	44950	Fanny	113	“ Yes ; I do not know how it has happened . ”
45230	45241	45243	45243	he	1164	“ We will stay till this is finished , Fanny , ”
46075	46081	46083	46083	she	1182	“ I am rather surprised , ”
46085	46151	46083	46083	she	1182	“ that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon , after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about , that I thought something would certainly occur , when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere . He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield . ”
46152	46159	46161	46161	Edmund	108	“ It is to his credit , ”
46165	46184	46161	46161	Edmund	108	“ and I dare say it gives his sister pleasure . She does not like his unsettled habits . ”
46185	46195	46083	46083	she	1182	“ What a favourite he is with my cousins ! ”
46196	46252	46161	46161	Edmund	108	“ Yes , his manners to women are such as must please . Mrs. Grant , I believe , suspects him of a preference for Julia ; I have never seen much symptom of it , but I wish it may be so . He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove . ”
46253	46261	46263	46263	Fanny	113	“ If Miss Bertram were not engaged , ”
46266	46280	46263	46263	Fanny	113	“ I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia . ”
46281	46389	46161	46161	Edmund	108	“ Which is , perhaps , more in favour of his liking Julia best , than you , Fanny , may be aware ; for I believe it often happens that a man , before he has quite made up his own mind , will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself . Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . ”
46701	46707	46709	46710	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I think , ma’am , ”
46729	46739	46712	46712	her	105	“ we shall see some happy faces again now . ”
46740	46747	46749	46750	the other	477	“ Yes , ma’am , indeed , ”
46757	46809	46749	46750	the other	477	“ there will be some satisfaction in looking on _ now _ , and I think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part . Young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the common forms . I wonder my son did not propose it . ”
46810	46881	46882	46883	Miss Bertram	112	“ I dare say he did , ma’am . Mr. Rushworth is never remiss . But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety , so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays , Mrs. Rushworth — that wish of avoiding particularity ! Dear ma’am , only look at her face at this moment ; how different from what it was the two last dances ! ”
46957	47025	46953	46954	Mrs. Norris	105	“ It is quite delightful , ma’am , to see young people so properly happy , so well suited , and so much the thing ! I can not but think of dear Sir Thomas ’s delight . And what do you say , ma’am , to the chance of another match ? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example , and such things are very catching . ”
47042	47056	47026	47027	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ The couple above , ma’am . Do you see no symptoms there ? ”
47057	47081	46953	46954	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Oh dear ! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford . Yes , indeed , a very pretty match . What is his property ? ”
47082	47088	46953	46954	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Four thousand a year . ”
47089	47136	47026	47027	Mrs. Rushworth	126	“ Very well . Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have . Four thousand a year is a pretty estate , and he seems a very genteel , steady young man , so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy . ”
47137	47178	47179	47179	Fanny	113	“ It is not a settled thing , ma’am , yet . We only speak of it among friends . But I have very little doubt it _ will _ be . He is growing extremely particular in his attentions . ”
47328	47344	47309	47309	he	108	“ If you want to dance , Fanny , I will stand up with you . ”
47362	47369	47371	47371	he	108	“ I am glad of it , ”
47386	47490	47371	47371	he	108	“ for I am tired to death . I only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long . They had need be _ all _ in love , to find any amusement in such folly ; and so they are , I fancy . If you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers — all but Yates and Mrs. Grant — and , between ourselves , she , poor woman , must want a lover as much as any one of them . A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor , ”
47542	47574	47496	47496	he	1209	“ A strange business this in America , Dr. Grant ! What is your opinion ? I always come to you to know what I am to think of public matters . ”
47575	47580	47582	47583	his aunt	630	“ My dear Tom , ”
47587	47612	47582	47583	his aunt	630	“ as you are not dancing , I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber ; shall you ? ”
47632	47708	47582	47583	his aunt	630	“ We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth , you know . Your mother is quite anxious about it , but can not very well spare time to sit down herself , because of her fringe . Now , you and I and Dr. Grant will just do ; and though _ we _ play but half - crowns , you know , you may bet half - guineas with _ him _ . ”
47709	47716	47718	47718	he	1209	“ I should be most happy , ”
47727	47750	47718	47718	he	1209	“ it would give me the greatest pleasure ; but that I am this moment going to dance . Come , Fanny , ”
47755	47770	47718	47718	he	1209	“ do not be dawdling any longer , or the dance will be over . ”
47810	47819	47820	47820	he	1209	“ A pretty modest request upon my word , ”
47828	48011	47820	47820	he	1209	“ To want to nail me to a card - table for the next two hours with herself and Dr. Grant , who are always quarrelling , and that poking old woman , who knows no more of whist than of algebra . I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy ! And to ask me in such a way too ! without ceremony , before them all , so as to leave me no possibility of refusing . _ That _ is what I dislike most particularly . It raises my spleen more than anything , to have the pretence of being asked , of being given a choice , and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing , whatever it be ! If I had not luckily thought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it . It is a great deal too bad . But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head , nothing can stop her . ”
48436	48441	48443	48443	he	174	“ A trifling part , ”
48445	48659	48443	48443	he	174	“ and not at all to my taste , and such a one as I certainly would not accept again ; but I was determined to make no difficulties . Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford ; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me , it was impossible to take it , you know . I was sorry for _ him _ that he should have so mistaken his powers , for he was no more equal to the Baron — a little man with a weak voice , always hoarse after the first ten minutes . It must have injured the piece materially ; but _ I _ was resolved to make no difficulties . Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick , but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself ; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two . I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick . Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him . Our Agatha was inimitable , and the duke was thought very great by many . And upon the whole , it would certainly have gone off wonderfully . ”
48660	48670	48422	48422	Lovers	177	“ It was a hard case , upon my word ”
48674	48686	48443	48443	he	174	“ I do think you were very much to be pitied , ”
48695	48803	48443	48443	he	174	“ It is not worth complaining about ; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time ; and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted . It was but three days ; and being only a grandmother , and all happening two hundred miles off , I think there would have been no great harm , and it was suggested , I know ; but Lord Ravenshaw , who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England , would not hear of it . ”
48804	48812	48814	48815	Mr. Bertram	108	“ An afterpiece instead of a comedy , ”
48817	48905	48814	48815	Mr. Bertram	108	“ Lovers ’ Vows were at an end , and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves . Well , the jointure may comfort _ him _ ; and perhaps , between friends , he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron , and was not sorry to withdraw ; and to make _ you _ amends , Yates , I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield , and ask you to be our manager . ”
48993	49006	49007	49008	Each sister	332	“ Oh for the Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with . ”
49042	49047	49049	49049	he	131	“ I really believe , ”
49051	49157	49049	49049	he	131	“ I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written , from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat . I feel as if I could be anything or everything ; as if I could rant and storm , or sigh or cut capers , in any tragedy or comedy in the English language . Let us be doing something . Be it only half a play , an act , a scene ; what should prevent us ? Not these countenances , I am sure , ”
49164	49190	49049	49049	he	131	“ and for a theatre , what signifies a theatre ? We shall be only amusing ourselves . Any room in this house might suffice . ”
49191	49198	49200	49201	Tom Bertram	101	“ We must have a curtain , ”
49203	49221	49200	49201	Tom Bertram	101	“ a few yards of green baize for a curtain , and perhaps that may be enough . ”
49222	49228	49230	49231	Mr. Yates	174	“ Oh , quite enough , ”
49233	49282	49230	49231	Mr. Yates	174	“ with only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this . For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more . ”
49283	49295	49297	49297	Maria	126	“ I believe we must be satisfied with _ less _ , ”
49299	49348	49297	49297	Maria	126	“ There would not be time , and other difficulties would arise . We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford ’s views , and make the _ performance _ , not the _ theatre _ , our object . Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery . ”
49349	49352	49354	49354	Edmund	108	“ Nay , ”
49363	49454	49354	49354	Edmund	108	“ Let us do nothing by halves . If we are to act , let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit , boxes , and gallery , and let us have a play entire from beginning to end ; so as it be a German play , no matter what , with a good tricking , shifting afterpiece , and a figure - dance , and a hornpipe , and a song between the acts . If we do not outdo Ecclesford , we do nothing . ”
49455	49465	49467	49467	Julia	112	“ Now , Edmund , do not be disagreeable , ”
49469	49489	49467	49467	Julia	112	“ Nobody loves a play better than you do , or can have gone much farther to see one . ”
49490	49551	49297	49297	Maria	126	“ True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ”
49755	49904	49743	49743	Fanny	113	entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground . I can stand it no longer , and I think , I may say , that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again ; but one good thing I have just ascertained : it is the very room for a theatre , precisely the shape and length for it ; and the doors at the farther end , communicating with each other , as they may be made to do in five minutes , by merely moving the bookcase in my father ’s room , is the very thing we could have desired , if we had sat down to wish for it ; and my father ’s room will be an excellent greenroom . It seems to join the billiard - room on purpose . ”
49905	49918	49920	49920	Edmund	108	“ You are not serious , Tom , in meaning to act ? ”
49934	49955	49920	49920	Edmund	108	“ Not serious ! never more so , I assure you . What is there to surprise you in it ? ”
49956	50062	49743	49743	Fanny	113	“ I think it would be very wrong . In a _ general _ light , private theatricals are open to some objections , but as _ we _ are circumstanced , I must think it would be highly injudicious , and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind . It would shew great want of feeling on my father ’s account , absent as he is , and in some degree of constant danger ; and it would be imprudent , I think , with regard to Maria , whose situation is a very delicate one , considering everything , extremely delicate . ”
50063	50291	50293	50293	he	1247	“ You take up a thing so seriously ! as if we were going to act three times a week till my father ’s return , and invite all the country . But it is not to be a display of that sort . We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves , just to vary the scene , and exercise our powers in something new . We want no audience , no publicity . We may be trusted , I think , in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable ; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own . I have no fears and no scruples . And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he . It is a _ very _ anxious period for her . ”
50356	50365	50367	50367	Tom	101	“ By Jove ! this wo n’t do , ”
50379	50396	50367	50367	Tom	101	“ To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety — I was unlucky there . ”
50397	50403	50405	50406	her ladyship	921	“ What is the matter ? ”
50418	50424	50405	50406	her ladyship	921	“ I was not asleep . ”
50425	50441	50442	50442	he	108	“ Oh dear , no , ma’am , nobody suspected you ! Well , Edmund , ”
50466	50485	50459	50460	Lady Bertram	106	“ but _ this _ I _ will _ maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . ”
50486	50505	50405	50406	her ladyship	921	“ I can not agree with you ; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it . ”
50506	50634	50459	50460	Lady Bertram	106	“ And I am convinced to the contrary . Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people , or promotes it more , than my father , and for anything of the acting , spouting , reciting kind , I think he has always a decided taste . I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys . How many a time have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar , and to _ be’d _ and not _ to _ _ be’d _ , in this very room , for his amusement ? And I am sure , _ my _ _ name _ _ was _ _ Norval _ , every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays . ”
50635	50684	50459	50460	Lady Bertram	106	“ It was a very different thing . You must see the difference yourself . My father wished us , as schoolboys , to speak well , but he would never wish his grown - up daughters to be acting plays . His sense of decorum is strict . ”
50685	50691	50693	50693	Tom	101	“ I know all that , ”
50697	50741	50693	50693	Tom	101	“ I know my father as well as you do ; and I ’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him . Manage your own concerns , Edmund , and I ’ll take care of the rest of the family . ”
50742	50750	50754	50754	Edmund	108	“ If you are resolved on acting , ”
50756	50801	50754	50754	Edmund	108	“ I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way ; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted . It would be taking liberties with my father ’s house in his absence which could not be justified . ”
50802	50813	50815	50815	Tom	101	“ For everything of that nature I will be answerable , ”
50822	50946	50815	50815	Tom	101	“ His house shall not be hurt . I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other . Absolute nonsense ! ”
50947	50965	50754	50754	Edmund	108	“ The innovation , if not wrong as an innovation , will be wrong as an expense . ”
50966	51100	50815	50815	Tom	101	“ Yes , the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious ! Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds . Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly , but it will be on the simplest plan : a green curtain and a little carpenter ’s work , and that ’s all ; and as the carpenter ’s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself , it will be too absurd to talk of expense ; and as long as Jackson is employed , everything will be right with Sir Thomas . Do n’t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself . Do n’t act yourself , if you do not like it , but do n’t expect to govern everybody else . ”
51101	51109	51111	51111	Edmund	108	“ No , as to acting myself , ”
51113	51122	51111	51111	Edmund	108	“ _ that _ I absolutely protest against . ”
51181	51208	51174	51174	her	1252	“ Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them . Your brother ’s taste and your sisters ’ seem very different . ”
51209	51252	51174	51174	her	1252	“ I have no hope there , Fanny . If they persist in the scheme , they will find something . I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _ them _ , and that is all I can do . ”
51253	51266	51174	51174	her	1252	“ I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . ”
51267	51337	51338	51338	His	1253	“ I dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her . Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all , and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears . ”
51556	51613	51542	51543	Henry Crawford	131	“ No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram . No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves . ”
51623	51640	51616	51616	Edmund	108	“ What say you now ? Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same ? ”
52256	52392	52393	52393	Fanny	113	“ Oh no , _ that _ will never do ! Let us have no ranting tragedies . Too many characters . Not a tolerable woman ’s part in the play . Anything but _ that _ , my dear Tom . It would be impossible to fill it up . One could not expect anybody to take such a part . Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end . _ That _ might do , perhaps , but for the low parts . If I _ must _ give my opinion , I have always thought it the most insipid play in the English language . _ I _ do not wish to make objections ; I shall be happy to be of any use , but I think we could not chuse worse . ”
52458	52464	52466	52467	Tom Bertram	101	“ This will never do , ”
52471	52577	52466	52467	Tom Bertram	101	“ We are wasting time most abominably . Something must be fixed on . No matter what , so that something is chosen . We must not be so nice . A few characters too many must not frighten us . We must _ double _ them . We must descend a little . If a part is insignificant , the greater our credit in making anything of it . From this moment I make no difficulties . I take any part you chuse to give me , so as it be comic . Let it but be comic , I condition for nothing more . ”
52669	52797	52628	52630	the Dramatis Personæ	1287	exclaimed—“Lovers ’ Vows ! And why should not Lovers ’ Vows do for _ us _ as well as for the Ravenshaws ? How came it never to be thought of before ? It strikes me as if it would do exactly . What say you all ? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates and Crawford , and here is the rhyming Butler for me , if nobody else wants it ; a trifling part , but the sort of thing I should not dislike , and , as I said before , I am determined to take anything and do my best . And as for the rest , they may be filled up by anybody . It is only Count Cassel and Anhalt . ”
53111	53121	53123	53123	she	112	“ This is not behaving well by the absent , ”
53125	53153	53123	53123	she	112	“ Here are not women enough . Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me , but here is nothing for your sister , Mr. Crawford . ”
53231	53242	53244	53244	he	133	“ It falls as naturally , as necessarily to her , ”
53246	53273	53244	53244	he	133	“ as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters . It can be no sacrifice on their side , for it is highly comic . ”
53333	53343	53345	53345	he	133	“ I must entreat Miss _ Julia _ Bertram , ”
53347	53376	53345	53345	he	133	“ not to engage in the part of Agatha , or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity . You must not , indeed you must not ”
53383	53422	53345	53345	he	133	“ I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness . The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me , and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away . ”
53512	53643	53503	53503	his	451	“ Oh yes ! Maria must be Agatha . Maria will be the best Agatha . Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy , I would not trust her in it . There is nothing of tragedy about her . She has not the look of it . Her features are not tragic features , and she walks too quick , and speaks too quick , and would not keep her countenance . She had better do the old countrywoman : the Cottager ’s wife ; you had , indeed , Julia . Cottager ’s wife is a very pretty part , I assure you . The old lady relieves the high - flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit . You shall be Cottager ’s wife . ”
53644	53649	53651	53652	Mr. Yates	174	“ Cottager ’s wife ! ”
53654	53751	53503	53503	his	451	“ What are you talking of ? The most trivial , paltry , insignificant part ; the merest commonplace ; not a tolerable speech in the whole . Your sister do that ! It is an insult to propose it . At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it . We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else . A little more justice , Mr. Manager , if you please . You do not deserve the office , if you can not appreciate the talents of your company a little better . ”
53752	53919	53503	53503	his	451	“ Why , as to _ that _ , my good friend , till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork ; but I mean no disparagement to Julia . We can not have two Agathas , and we must have one Cottager ’s wife ; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler . If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it ; and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous , let her take Cottager ’s speeches instead of Cottager ’s wife ’s , and so change the parts all through ; _ he _ is solemn and pathetic enough , I am sure . It could make no difference in the play , and as for Cottager himself , when he has got his wife ’s speeches , _ I _ would undertake him with all my heart . ”
53920	53930	53932	53933	Henry Crawford	131	“ With all your partiality for Cottager ’s wife , ”
53935	54093	53932	53933	Henry Crawford	131	“ it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister , and we must not suffer her good - nature to be imposed on . We must not _ allow _ her to accept the part . She must not be left to her own complaisance . Her talents will be wanted in Amelia . Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha . I consider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece . It requires great powers , great nicety , to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance . I have seen good actresses fail in the part . Simplicity , indeed , is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession . It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not . It requires a gentlewoman — a Julia Bertram . You _ will _ undertake it , I hope ? ”
54129	54208	54123	54124	Miss Crawford	127	“ No , no , Julia must not be Amelia . It is not at all the part for her . She would not like it . She would not do well . She is too tall and robust . Amelia should be a small , light , girlish , skipping figure . It is fit for Miss Crawford , and Miss Crawford only . She looks the part , and I am persuaded will do it admirably . ”
54220	54226	54228	54228	he	131	“ You must oblige us , ”
54230	54305	54228	54228	he	131	“ indeed you must . When you have studied the character , I am sure you will feel it suit you . Tragedy may be your choice , but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _ you _ . You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions ; you will not refuse to visit me in prison ? I think I see you coming in with your basket . ”
54423	54464	54418	54418	she	112	“ You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions — though one might have supposed — but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering ! ”
54490	54504	54485	54486	Tom Bertram	101	“ Miss Crawford must be Amelia . She will be an excellent Amelia . ”
54505	54518	54520	54520	Julia	112	“ Do not be afraid of _ my _ wanting the character , ”
54526	54598	54520	54520	Julia	112	“ I am _ not _ to be Agatha , and I am sure I will do nothing else ; and as to Amelia , it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me . I quite detest her . An odious , little , pert , unnatural , impudent girl . I have always protested against comedy , and this is comedy in its worst form . ”
54721	54758	54717	54717	she	112	“ I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _ she _ would do it worse , ”
55312	55319	55321	55321	he	113	“ We have got a play , ”
55323	55384	55321	55321	he	113	“ It is to be Lovers ’ Vows ; and I am to be Count Cassel , and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak , and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit , by way of a shooting - dress . I do not know how I shall like it . ”
55416	55421	55431	55431	his	108	“ Lovers ’ Vows ! ”
55453	55456	55458	55459	Mr. Yates	174	“ Yes , ”
55461	55542	55458	55459	Mr. Yates	174	“ After all our debatings and difficulties , we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well , nothing so unexceptionable , as Lovers ’ Vows . The wonder is that it should not have been thought of before . My stupidity was abominable , for here we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford ; and it is so useful to have anything of a model ! We have cast almost every part . ”
55543	55552	55554	55554	Edmund	108	“ But what do you do for women ? ”
55572	55586	55569	55569	she	126	“ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ”
55593	55601	55569	55569	she	126	“ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ”
55602	55625	55627	55627	Edmund	108	“ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ”
55662	55714	55655	55656	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ I come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches . That ’s something , is not it ? But I do not much like the idea of being so fine . I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . ”
55765	55883	55756	55756	Edmund	108	“ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over . Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it . It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father ’s _ judgment , I am convinced . ”
55884	55891	55893	55893	Maria	126	“ We see things very differently , ”
55895	55958	55893	55893	Maria	126	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ”
55959	55966	55968	55968	his	1334	“ I am sorry for it , ”
55971	56035	55968	55968	his	1334	“ but in this matter it is _ you _ who are to lead . _ You _ must set the example . If others have blundered , it is your place to put them right , and shew them what true delicacy is . In all points of decorum _ your _ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ”
56065	56124	56062	56062	she	126	“ I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind . _ There _ would be the greatest indecorum , I think . ”
56125	56218	55968	55968	his	1334	“ Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head ? No ; let your conduct be the only harangue . Say that , on examining the part , you feel yourself unequal to it ; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have . Say this with firmness , and it will be quite enough . All who can distinguish will understand your motive . The play will be given up , and your delicacy honoured as it ought . ”
56219	56229	56231	56232	Lady Bertram	106	“ Do not act anything improper , my dear , ”
56234	56261	56231	56232	Lady Bertram	106	“ Sir Thomas would not like it.—Fanny , ring the bell ; I must have my dinner.—To be sure , Julia is dressed by this time . ”
56262	56269	56271	56271	Edmund	108	“ I am convinced , madam , ”
56276	56285	56271	56271	Edmund	108	“ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ”
56286	56299	56231	56232	Lady Bertram	106	“ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ”
56300	56309	56311	56311	Maria	126	“ If I were to decline the part , ”
56317	56324	56311	56311	Maria	126	“ Julia would certainly take it . ”
56325	56328	56330	56330	Edmund	108	“ What ! ”
56332	56339	56330	56330	Edmund	108	“ if she knew your reasons ! ”
56340	56428	56231	56232	Lady Bertram	106	“ Oh ! she might think the difference between us — the difference in our situations — that _ she _ need not be so scrupulous as _ I _ might feel necessary . I am sure she would argue so . No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ”
56429	56441	56443	56444	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I was just going to say the very same thing , ”
56446	56942	56443	56444	Mrs. Norris	105	“ If every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure _ that _ would be a discredit to us all . I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out . We must not be over - precise , Edmund . As Mr. Rushworth is to act too , there can be no harm . I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors . The curtain will be a good job , however . The maids do their work very well , and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings . There is no occasion to put them so very close together . I _ am _ of some use , I hope , in preventing waste and making the most of things . There should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones . I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day . I had been looking about me in the poultry - yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants ’ hall - door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them . I knew what all this meant , for the servants ’ dinner - bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads ; and as I hate such encroaching people ( the Jacksons are very encroaching , I have always said so : just the sort of people to get all they can ) , I said to the boy directly ( a great lubberly fellow of ten years old , you know , who ought to be ashamed of himself ) , ‘ _ I ’ll _ take the boards to your father , Dick , so get you home again as fast as you can . ’ The boy looked very silly , and turned away without offering a word , for I believe I might speak pretty sharp ; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while . I hate such greediness — so good as your father is to the family , employing the man all the year round ! ”
57213	57222	57183	57183	Mr.	1344	“ Well , how do you go on ? ”
57224	57230	57183	57183	Mr.	1344	“ What have you settled ? ”
57232	57242	57183	57183	Mr.	1344	“ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ”
57282	57290	57292	57292	she	106	“ I must really congratulate your ladyship , ”
57294	57369	57292	57292	she	106	“ on the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties . The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ”
57454	57507	57451	57451	she	127	“ My good friends , you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses , inside and out ; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile . Who is to be Anhalt ? What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to ? ”
57536	57553	57517	57517	many	4303	“ Mr. Rushworth was to be Count Cassel , but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt . ”
57554	57563	57565	57566	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ I had my choice of the parts , ”
57568	57592	57565	57566	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ but I thought I should like the Count best , though I do not much relish the finery I am to have . ”
57593	57603	57605	57606	Miss Crawford	127	“ You chose very wisely , I am sure , ”
57613	57620	57605	57606	Miss Crawford	127	“ Anhalt is a heavy part . ”
57621	57636	57638	57639	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ _ The _ _ Count _ has two - and - forty speeches , ”
57641	57647	57638	57639	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ which is no trifle . ”
57648	57656	57658	57659	Miss Crawford	127	“ I am not at all surprised , ”
57666	57690	57658	57659	Miss Crawford	127	“ at this want of an Anhalt . Amelia deserves no better . Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ”
57691	57708	57710	57710	Tom	101	“ I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ”
57712	57750	57710	57710	Tom	101	“ but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together . I will not entirely give it up , however ; I will try what can be done — I will look it over again . ”
57751	57761	57763	57764	Mr. Yates	174	“ Your _ brother _ should take the part , ”
57771	57779	57763	57764	Mr. Yates	174	“ Do not you think he would ? ”
57780	57789	57791	57791	Tom	101	“ _ I _ shall not ask him , ”
57817	57826	57828	57828	she	127	“ They do not want me at all , ”
57833	57901	57828	57828	she	127	“ I only puzzle them , and oblige them to make civil speeches . Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ . What shall we do for an Anhalt ? Is it practicable for any of the others to double it ? What is your advice ? ”
57902	57906	57908	57908	he	1352	“ My advice , ”
57911	57919	57908	57908	he	1352	“ is that you change the play . ”
57920	57929	57930	57930	she	127	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ”
57933	57983	57930	57930	she	127	“ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ”
57989	57997	57930	57930	she	127	“ it certainly will not be taken . ”
58003	58024	58026	58028	the lady archly	1353	“ If _ any _ part could tempt _ you _ to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , ”
58035	58045	58026	58028	the lady archly	1353	“ for he is a clergyman , you know . ”
58046	58058	58059	58059	he	1352	“ _ That _ circumstance would by no means tempt me , ”
58062	58119	58059	58059	he	1352	“ for I should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting . It must be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal , solemn lecturer ; and the man who chuses the profession itself is , perhaps , one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage . ”
58158	58161	58163	58164	Tom Bertram	101	“ Fanny , ”
58184	58190	58163	58164	Tom Bertram	101	“ we want your services . ”
58225	58265	58221	58221	Edmund	108	“ Oh ! we do not want to disturb you from your seat . We do not want your _ present _ services . We shall only want you in our play . You must be Cottager ’s wife . ”
58266	58269	58271	58271	Fanny	113	“ Me ! ”
58282	58312	58271	58271	Fanny	113	“ Indeed you must excuse me . I could not act anything if you were to give me the world . No , indeed , I can not act . ”
58313	58388	58221	58221	Edmund	108	“ Indeed , but you must , for we can not excuse you . It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ”
58389	58400	58402	58403	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ”
58405	58425	58402	58403	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ what would you do with such a part as mine ? I have forty - two to learn . ”
58426	58439	58441	58441	Fanny	113	“ It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , ”
58468	58476	58441	58441	Fanny	113	“ but I really can not act . ”
58477	58542	58221	58221	Edmund	108	“ Yes , yes , you can act well enough for _ us _ . Learn your part , and we will teach you all the rest . You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it . ”
58543	58584	58402	58403	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ No , indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me . You can not have an idea . It would be absolutely impossible for me . If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . ”
58585	58668	58221	58221	Edmund	108	“ Phoo ! Phoo ! Do not be so shamefaced . You ’ll do it very well . Every allowance will be made for you . We do not expect perfection . You must get a brown gown , and a white apron , and a mob cap , and we must make you a few wrinkles , and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes , and you will be a very proper , little old woman . ”
58669	58681	58683	58683	Fanny	113	“ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ”
58813	58877	58797	58798	Mrs. Norris	105	audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you ! Take the part with a good grace , and let us hear no more of the matter , I entreat . ”
58878	58886	58888	58888	Edmund	108	“ Do not urge her , madam , ”
58890	58941	58797	58798	Mrs. Norris	105	“ It is not fair to urge her in this manner . You see she does not like to act . Let her chuse for herself , as well as the rest of us . Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted . Do not urge her any more . ”
58942	58951	58953	58954	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I am not going to urge her , ”
58957	58995	58953	58954	Mrs. Norris	105	“ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . ”
59038	59056	59021	59021	Fanny	113	“ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ”
59090	59118	59086	59086	she	127	“ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ”
59414	59427	59428	59428	he	101	“ But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it , ”
59431	59548	59428	59428	he	101	“ We have but to speak the word ; we may pick and chuse . I could name , at this moment , at least six young men within six miles of us , who are wild to be admitted into our company , and there are one or two that would not disgrace us : I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox . Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow , and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere , so I will take my horse early to - morrow morning and ride over to Stoke , and settle with one of them . ”
59600	59687	59595	59596	Miss Crawford	127	“ As far as I am concerned , I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible . Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen ? Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister ’s one day , did not he , Henry ? A quiet - looking young man . I remember him . Let _ him _ be applied to , if you please , for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger . ”
59741	59752	59753	59753	Edmund	108	“ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ”
59769	59780	59782	59783	Miss Crawford	127	“ I am not very sanguine as to our play , ”
59795	59844	59782	59783	Miss Crawford	127	“ and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _ his _ speeches , and a great many of _ my _ _ own _ , before we rehearse together . It will be very disagreeable , and by no means what I expected . ”
61251	61254	61249	61249	her	105	“ Come in ”
61284	61298	61300	61300	he	108	“ Can I speak with you , Fanny , for a few minutes ? ”
61302	61307	61300	61300	he	108	“ Yes , certainly . ”
61308	61319	61275	61275	Her	105	“ I want to consult . I want your opinion . ”
61320	61324	61325	61325	she	105	“ My opinion ! ”
61340	61504	61325	61325	she	105	“ Yes , your advice and opinion . I do not know what to do . This acting scheme gets worse and worse , you see . They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could , and now , to complete the business , are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us . This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first . I know no harm of Charles Maddox ; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable , the _ more _ than intimacy — the familiarity . I can not think of it with any patience ; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must , _ if _ _ possible _ , be prevented . Do not you see it in the same light ? ”
61505	61520	61275	61275	Her	105	“ Yes ; but what can be done ? Your brother is so determined . ”
61521	61552	61557	61557	him	1407	“ There is but _ one _ thing to be done , Fanny . I must take Anhalt myself . I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom . ”
61559	61569	61570	61570	he	1407	“ It is not at all what I like , ”
61573	61639	61570	61570	he	1407	“ No man can like being driven into the _ appearance _ of such inconsistency . After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning , there is absurdity in the face of my joining them _ now _ , when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect ; but I can think of no other alternative . Can you , Fanny ? ”
61640	61643	61645	61645	Fanny	113	“ No , ”
61648	61654	61645	61645	Fanny	113	“ not immediately , but — ”
61655	61876	61275	61275	Her	105	“ But what ? I see your judgment is not with me . Think it a little over . Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _ may _ , of the unpleasantness that _ must _ arise from a young man ’s being received in this manner : domesticated among us ; authorised to come at all hours , and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints . To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create . It is all very bad ! Put yourself in Miss Crawford ’s place , Fanny . Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger . She has a right to be felt for , because she evidently feels for herself . I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger ; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations — perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be — it would be ungenerous , it would be really wrong to expose her to it . Her feelings ought to be respected . Does it not strike you so , Fanny ? You hesitate . ”
61877	61927	61570	61570	he	1407	“ I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . It will be such a triumph to the others ! ”
61928	62087	61645	61645	Fanny	113	“ They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I act . But , however , triumph there certainly will be , and I must brave it . But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business , of limiting the exhibition , of concentrating our folly , I shall be well repaid . As I am now , I have no influence , I can do nothing : I have offended them , and they will not hear me ; but when I have put them in good - humour by this concession , I am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for . This will be a material gain . My object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants . Will not this be worth gaining ? ”
62088	62098	61275	61275	Her	105	“ Yes , it will be a great point . ”
62099	62125	61570	61570	he	1407	“ But still it has not your approbation . Can you mention any other measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good ? ”
62126	62137	61645	61645	Fanny	113	“ No , I can not think of anything else . ”
62138	62155	61275	61275	Her	105	“ Give me your approbation , then , Fanny . I am not comfortable without it . ”
62156	62161	61275	61275	Her	105	“ Oh , cousin ! ”
62162	62236	61645	61645	Fanny	113	“ If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet — But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act — no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough . I thought _ you _ would have entered more into Miss Crawford ’s feelings . ”
62237	62255	62257	62257	Fanny	113	“ No doubt she will be very glad . It must be a great relief to her , ”
62266	62292	62257	62257	Fanny	113	“ She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night . It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill . ”
62293	62311	62313	62313	She	1408	“ She _ was _ very kind , indeed , and I am glad to have her spared ”
62334	62343	62345	62345	he	108	“ I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , ”
62347	62494	62345	62345	he	108	“ and am sure of giving pleasure there . And now , dear Fanny , I will not interrupt you any longer . You want to be reading . But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you , and come to a decision . Sleeping or waking , my head has been full of this matter all night . It is an evil , but I am certainly making it less than it might be . If Tom is up , I shall go to him directly and get it over , and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good - humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity . _ You _ , in the meanwhile , will be taking a trip into China , I suppose . How does Lord Macartney go on?”—opening
62507	62577	62578	62578	He	1409	“ And here are Crabbe ’s Tales , and the Idler , at hand to relieve you , if you tire of your great book . I admire your little establishment exceedingly ; and as soon as I am gone , you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting , and sit comfortably down to your table . But do not stay here to be cold . ”
63001	63031	63079	63080	Mrs. Norris	105	“ To have it quite in their own family circle was what they had particularly wished . A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort ”
63117	63120	63122	63122	Tom	101	“ Perhaps , ”
63124	63143	63122	63122	Tom	101	“ Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now . Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . ”
63144	63158	63114	63114	his	108	“ No , she is quite determined . She certainly will not act . ”
63159	63165	63122	63122	Tom	101	“ Oh ! very well . ”
63242	63261	63218	63218	hers	127	“ He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . ”
64094	64106	64108	64108	her	123	“ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ”
64113	64120	64122	64122	Mary	132	“ I dare say she is , ”
64125	64132	64122	64122	Mary	132	“ I imagine both sisters are . ”
64133	64159	64108	64108	her	123	“ Both ! no , no , that must not be . Do not give him a hint of it . Think of Mr. Rushworth ! ”
64160	64229	64108	64108	her	123	“ You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth . It may do _ her _ some good . I often think of Mr. Rushworth ’s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him . A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . ”
64230	64275	64122	64122	Mary	132	“ I dare say he _ will _ be in parliament soon . When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet . ”
64276	64290	64292	64292	Mary	132	“ Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ”
64298	64370	64292	64292	Mary	132	“ Do you remember Hawkins Browne ’s ‘ Address to Tobacco , ’ in imitation of Pope ? — Blest leaf ! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty , to Parsons sense . I will parody them — Blest Knight ! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence , to Rushworth sense . Will not that do , Mrs. Grant ? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas ’s return . ”
64371	64511	64122	64122	Mary	132	“ You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you . I do not think we do so well without him . He has a fine dignified manner , which suits the head of such a house , and keeps everybody in their place . Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order . But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry . I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends , I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ”
64512	64533	64292	64292	Mary	132	“ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ”
64534	64592	64122	64122	Mary	132	“ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
65750	65810	65737	65738	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ? For the life and soul of me , I can not admire him ; and , between ourselves , to see such an undersized , little , mean - looking man , set up for a fine actor , is very ridiculous in my opinion . ”
66142	66146	66147	66147	she	105	it—“Come , Fanny , ”
66150	66291	66147	66147	she	105	“ these are fine times for you , but you must not be always walking from one room to the other , and doing the lookings - on at your ease , in this way ; I want you here . I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth ’s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . There are but three seams ; you may do them in a trice . It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do . _ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . ”
66314	66397	66308	66308	Bertram	126	“ One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too . What is the play about , Fanny ? you have never told me . ”
66398	66434	66308	66308	Bertram	126	“ Oh ! sister , pray do not ask her now ; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time . It is about Lovers ’ Vows . ”
66435	66439	66441	66441	Fanny	113	“ I believe , ”
66447	66474	66441	66441	Fanny	113	“ there will be three acts rehearsed to - morrow evening , and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once . ”
66475	66486	66488	66489	Mrs. Norris	105	“ You had better stay till the curtain is hung , ”
66491	66533	66488	66489	Mrs. Norris	105	“ the curtain will be hung in a day or two — there is very little sense in a play without a curtain — and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . ”
66868	66906	66865	66866	Miss Crawford	127	“ Am I right ? Yes ; this is the East room . My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . ”
66937	67070	67071	67071	Fanny	113	“ Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . Allow me to stay here a little while , and do have the goodness to hear me my third act . I have brought my book , and if you would but rehearse it with me , I should be _ so _ obliged ! I came here to - day intending to rehearse it with Edmund — by ourselves — against the evening , but he is not in the way ; and if he _ were _ , I do not think I could go through it with _ him _ , till I have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . You will be so good , wo n’t you ? ”
67091	67104	67106	67107	Miss Crawford	127	“ Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? ”
67113	67220	67106	67107	Miss Crawford	127	“ Here it is . I did not think much of it at first — but , upon my word . There , look at _ that _ speech , and _ that _ , and _ that _ . How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things ? Could you do it ? But then he is your cousin , which makes all the difference . You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees . You _ have _ a look of _ his _ sometimes . ”
67221	67253	67080	67080	she	1508	“ Have I ? I will do my best with the greatest readiness ; but I must _ read _ the part , for I can say very little of it . ”
67254	67542	67543	67543	She	1509	“ _ None _ of it , I suppose . You are to have the book , of course . Now for it . We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage . There — very good school - room chairs , not made for a theatre , I dare say ; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson . What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose ? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now , he would bless himself , for we are rehearsing all over the house . Yates is storming away in the dining - room . I heard him as I came upstairs , and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers , Agatha and Frederick . If _ they _ are not perfect , I _ shall _ be surprised . By the bye , I looked in upon them five minutes ago , and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _ not _ to embrace , and Mr. Rushworth was with me . I thought he began to look a little queer , so I turned it off as well as I could , by whispering to him , ‘ We shall have an excellent Agatha ; there is something so _ maternal _ in her manner , so completely _ maternal _ in her voice and countenance . ’ Was not that well done of me ? He brightened up directly . Now for my soliloquy . ”
68301	68307	68309	68309	she	123	“ Dr. Grant is ill , ”
68315	68348	68309	68309	she	123	“ He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today . He fancied it tough , sent away his plate , and has been suffering ever since ”
68448	68464	68465	68465	She	123	“ If Miss Price would be so good as to _ read _ the part . ”
68480	68496	68477	68477	Edmund	108	“ Do , Fanny , if it is not _ very _ disagreeable to you . ”
68577	68588	68590	68591	Henry Crawford	131	“ You have only to _ read _ the part , ”
68597	68610	68612	68612	Maria	126	“ And I do believe she can say every word of it , ”
68614	68639	68612	68612	Maria	126	“ for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places . Fanny , I am sure you know the part . ”
68769	68784	68755	68755	Julia	112	“ My father is come ! He is in the hall at this moment . ”
68942	68956	68911	68912	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ What will become of us ? what is to be done now ? ”
69094	69107	69085	69085	she	112	“ _ I _ need not be afraid of appearing before him . ”
69254	69278	69247	69248	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ Shall I go too ? Had not I better go too ? Will not it be right for me to go too ? ”
69719	69765	69766	69766	Fanny	113	“ he preferred remaining where he was , that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he _ was _ come ; and besides , he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away . ”
69918	69931	69905	69906	Sir Thomas	101	“ But where is Fanny ? Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and
71025	71055	71014	71014	she	105	“ Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea . Do have a basin of soup . ”
71063	71078	71014	71014	she	105	“ Still the same anxiety for everybody ’s comfort , my dear Mrs. Norris , ”
71083	71094	71014	71014	she	105	“ But indeed I would rather have nothing but tea . ”
71095	71124	71125	71125	She	105	“ Well , then , Lady Bertram , suppose you speak for tea directly ; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little ; he seems behindhand to - night . ”
71204	71234	71197	71197	her	105	“ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir Thomas ? They have been acting . We have been all alive with acting . ”
71235	71245	71197	71197	her	105	“ Indeed ! and what have you been acting ? ”
71246	71257	71197	71197	her	105	“ Oh ! they ’ll tell you all about it . ”
71258	71268	71270	71270	Tom	101	“ The _ all _ will soon be told , ”
71278	71497	71270	71270	Tom	101	“ but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now . You will hear enough of it to - morrow , sir . We have just been trying , by way of doing something , and amusing my mother , just within the last week , to get up a few scenes , a mere trifle . We have had such incessant rains almost since October began , that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together . I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd . Tolerable sport the first three days , but there has been no attempting anything since . The first day I went over Mansfield Wood , and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton , and we brought home six brace between us , and might each have killed six times as many , but we respect your pheasants , sir , I assure you , as much as you could desire . I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were . _ I _ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year . I hope you will take a day ’s sport there yourself , sir , soon . ”
71592	71598	71600	71600	he	108	“ Something must be done , ”
71602	71612	71614	71614	Maria	126	“ It is time to think of our visitors , ”
71634	71644	71645	71645	Fanny	113	“ Where did you leave Miss Crawford , Fanny ? ”
71656	71664	71666	71666	Tom	101	“ Then poor Yates is all alone , ”
71668	71688	71666	71666	Tom	101	“ I will go and fetch him . He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out . ”
72129	72133	72128	72131	the “ particular friend	4966	“ particular friend , ”
72411	72418	72420	72420	he	101	“ I come from your theatre , ”
72428	72499	72420	72420	he	101	“ I found myself in it rather unexpectedly . Its vicinity to my own room — but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character . It appears a neat job , however , as far as I could judge by candlelight , and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit . ”
72661	72676	72678	72678	Tom	101	“ This was , in fact , the origin of _ our _ acting , ”
72686	72740	72678	72678	Tom	101	“ My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford , and it spread — as those things always spread , you know , sir — the faster , probably , from _ your _ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly . It was like treading old ground again . ”
72979	72995	72996	72996	She	1632	“ On your judgment , Edmund , I depended ; what have you been about ? ”
73011	73034	73005	73005	her	1632	“ Oh , not to _ him _ ! Look so to all the others , but not to _ him _ ! ”
73041	73146	73035	73036	Mr. Yates	174	“ To own the truth , Sir Thomas , we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening . We were going through the three first acts , and not unsuccessfully upon the whole . Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result . We bespeak your indulgence , you understand , as young performers ; we bespeak your indulgence . ”
73147	73156	73158	73159	Sir Thomas	101	“ My indulgence shall be given , sir , ”
73162	73169	73176	73176	he	101	“ but without any other rehearsal . ”
73179	73189	73176	73176	he	101	“ I come home to be happy and indulgent . ”
73205	73226	73201	73201	he	101	“ Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield . Do you find them agreeable acquaintance ? ”
73264	73289	73240	73240	he	101	“ Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . ”
73298	73337	73290	73291	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ I do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . ”
73355	73364	73366	73367	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ If I must say what I think , ”
73369	73425	73366	73367	Mr. Rushworth	113	“ in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing . It is having too much of a good thing . I am not so fond of acting as I was at first . I think we are a great deal better employed , sitting comfortably here among ourselves , and doing nothing . ”
73439	73553	73426	73427	Sir Thomas	101	“ I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same . It gives me sincere satisfaction . That I should be cautious and quick - sighted , and feel many scruples which my children do _ not _ feel , is perfectly natural ; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity , for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures , should much exceed theirs . But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight . ”
73794	73805	73807	73807	he	101	“ We have all been more or less to blame , ”
73809	73869	73807	73807	he	101	“ every one of us , excepting Fanny . Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout ; who has been consistent . _ Her _ feelings have been steadily against it from first to last . She never ceased to think of what was due to you . You will find Fanny everything you could wish . ”
74366	74374	74376	74376	she	105	“ If I had not been active , ”
74378	74508	74376	74376	she	105	“ and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . But I left no stone unturned . I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister , and at last I did persuade her . You know the distance to Sotherton ; it was in the middle of winter , and the roads almost impassable , but I did persuade her . ”
74509	74541	74376	74376	she	105	“ I know how great , how justly great , your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children , and am the more concerned that it should not have been — ”
74542	74926	74376	74376	she	105	“ My dear Sir Thomas , if you had seen the state of the roads _ that _ day ! I thought we should never have got through them , though we had the four horses of course ; and poor old coachman would attend us , out of his great love and kindness , though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas . I cured him at last ; but he was very bad all the winter — and this was such a day , I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture : he was putting on his wig ; so I said , ‘ Coachman , you had much better not go ; your Lady and I shall be very safe ; you know how steady Stephen is , and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that I am sure there is no fear . ’ But , however , I soon found it would not do ; he was bent upon going , and as I hate to be worrying and officious , I said no more ; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt , and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke , where , what with frost and snow upon beds of stones , it was worse than anything you can imagine , I was quite in an agony about him . And then the poor horses too ! To see them straining away ! You know how I always feel for the horses . And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill , what do you think I did ? You will laugh at me ; but I got out and walked up . I did indeed . It might not be saving them much , but it was something , and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals . I caught a dreadful cold , but _ that _ I did not regard . My object was accomplished in the visit . ”
74927	75001	74376	74376	she	105	“ I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it . There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth ’s manners , but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject : his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting . He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish . ”
75002	75101	74376	74376	she	105	“ Yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing . ‘ Upon my word , Mrs. Norris , ’ said Mrs. Grant the other day , ‘ if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own , he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect . ’ ”
76153	76168	76170	76170	he	101	“ From Bath , Norfolk , London , York , wherever I may be , ”
76172	76189	76170	76170	he	101	“ I will attend you from any place in England , at an hour ’s notice . ”
76215	76240	76207	76207	He	101	“ I am sorry you are going ; but as to our play , _ that _ is all over — entirely at an end ”
76249	76293	76207	76207	He	101	“ The painter was sent off yesterday , and very little will remain of the theatre to - morrow . I knew how _ that _ would be from the first . It is early for Bath . You will find nobody there . ”
76294	76304	76207	76207	He	101	“ It is about my uncle ’s usual time . ”
76305	76313	76207	76207	He	101	“ When do you think of going ? ”
76314	76329	76207	76207	He	101	“ I may , perhaps , get as far as Banbury to - day . ”
76330	76339	76207	76207	He	101	“ Whose stables do you use at Bath ? ”
77206	77210	77211	77211	he	216	“ But they , ”
77216	77371	77211	77211	he	216	“ have a claim . They seem to belong to us ; they seem to be part of ourselves . I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away . I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected . But the truth is , that my father hardly knows them . They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England . If he knew them better , he would value their society as it deserves ; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like . We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease . Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father . ”
77372	77378	77380	77380	Fanny	113	“ Do you think so ? ”
77382	77546	77380	77380	Fanny	113	“ in my opinion , my uncle would not like _ any _ addition . I think he values the very quietness you speak of , and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants . And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be — I mean before my uncle went abroad . As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same . There was never much laughing in his presence ; or , if there is any difference , it is not more , I think , than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first . There must be a sort of shyness ; but I can not recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry , except when my uncle was in town . No young people ’s are , I suppose , when those they look up to are at home ”
77548	77557	77559	77559	his	1727	“ I believe you are right , Fanny , ”
77567	77621	77559	77559	his	1727	“ I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were , than assuming a new character . The novelty was in their being lively . Yet , how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give ! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . ”
77622	77632	77634	77634	Fanny	113	“ I suppose I am graver than other people , ”
77636	77693	77634	77634	Fanny	113	“ The evenings do not appear long to me . I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies . I could listen to him for an hour together . It entertains _ me _ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . ”
77694	77704	77559	77559	his	1727	“ Why should you dare say _ that _ ? ”
77709	77807	77559	77559	his	1727	“ Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet ? But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ? Go to my father if you want to be complimented . He will satisfy you . Ask your uncle what he thinks , and you will hear compliments enough : and though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . ”
77821	77968	77634	77634	Fanny	113	“ Your uncle thinks you very pretty , dear Fanny — and that is the long and the short of the matter . Anybody but myself would have made something more of it , and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before ; but the truth is , that your uncle never did admire you till now — and now he does . Your complexion is so improved!—and you have gained so much countenance!—and your figure — nay , Fanny , do not turn away about it — it is but an uncle . If you can not bear an uncle ’s admiration , what is to become of you ? You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at . You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman . ”
77969	77982	77984	77984	Fanny	113	“ Oh ! do n’t talk so , do n’t talk so , ”
78016	78055	78003	78003	he	1729	“ Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect ; and I only wish you would talk to him more . You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle . ”
78056	78089	77634	77634	Fanny	113	“ But I do talk to him more than I used . I am sure I do . Did not you hear me ask him about the slave - trade last night ? ”
78090	78119	77634	77634	Fanny	113	“ I did — and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others . It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther . ”
78120	78198	77634	77634	Fanny	113	“ And I longed to do it — but there was such a dead silence ! And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like — I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . ”
78199	78428	77634	77634	Fanny	113	“ Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect . We were talking of you at the Parsonage , and those were her words . She has great discernment . I know nobody who distinguishes characters better . For so young a woman it is remarkable ! She certainly understands _ you _ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _ many _ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it . I wonder what she thinks of my father ! She must admire him as a fine - looking man , with most gentlemanlike , dignified , consistent manners ; but perhaps , having seen him so seldom , his reserve may be a little repulsive . Could they be much together , I feel sure of their liking each other . He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers . I wish they met more frequently ! I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side . ”
78429	78446	78448	78448	Fanny	113	“ She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , ”
78455	78521	78448	78448	Fanny	113	“ to have any such apprehension . And Sir Thomas ’s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that . After a little while , I dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year . ”
78522	78579	78580	78580	Fanny	113	“ This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy . I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ”
78651	78693	78643	78643	she	127	“ To - morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too . We shall be quite a small party at home . I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . ”
78694	78779	78643	78643	she	127	“ That is impossible , Fanny . He must like him less after to - morrow ’s visit , for we shall be five hours in his company . I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow — the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas . He can not much longer deceive himself . I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ”
80626	80631	80639	80639	her	1784	“ Where is Fanny ? ”
81370	81378	81348	81349	Miss Crawford	127	“ Shall I play to you now ? ”
81380	81386	81435	81435	She	127	“ What will you have ? ”
81462	81469	81471	81472	Miss Crawford	127	“ Another quarter of an hour , ”
81474	81501	81471	81472	Miss Crawford	127	“ and we shall see how it will be . Do not run away the first moment of its holding up . Those clouds look alarming . ”
81502	81509	81511	81511	Fanny	113	“ But they are passed over , ”
81513	81528	81511	81511	Fanny	113	“ I have been watching them . This weather is all from the south . ”
81529	81591	81595	81595	she	127	“ South or north , I know a black cloud when I see it ; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening . And besides , I want to play something more to you — a very pretty piece — and your cousin Edmund ’s prime favourite . You must stay and hear your cousin ’s favourite . ”
82004	82012	82014	82014	Fanny	113	“ This is pretty , very pretty , ”
82028	82142	82151	82151	she	127	“ every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty . Three years ago , this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field , never thought of as anything , or capable of becoming anything ; and now it is converted into a walk , and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament ; and perhaps , in another three years , we may be forgetting — almost forgetting what it was before . How wonderful , how very wonderful the operations of time , and the changes of the human mind ! ”
82156	82269	82151	82151	she	127	“ If any one faculty of our nature may be called _ more _ wonderful than the rest , I do think it is memory . There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers , the failures , the inequalities of memory , than in any other of our intelligences . The memory is sometimes so retentive , so serviceable , so obedient ; at others , so bewildered and so weak ; and at others again , so tyrannic , so beyond control ! We are , to be sure , a miracle every way ; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out . ”
82300	82344	82283	82283	Fanny	113	“ It may seem impertinent in _ me _ to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this . There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk ! Not too much attempted ! ”
82345	82348	82350	82351	Miss Crawford	127	“ Yes , ”
82354	82405	82350	82351	Miss Crawford	127	“ it does very well for a place of this sort . One does not think of extent _ here _ ; and between ourselves , till I came to Mansfield , I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery , or anything of the kind . ”
82406	82417	82419	82419	Fanny	113	“ I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive ! ”
82424	82583	82419	82419	Fanny	113	“ My uncle ’s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own , and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general . The evergreen ! How beautiful , how welcome , how wonderful the evergreen ! When one thinks of it , how astonishing a variety of nature ! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety , but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence . You will think me rhapsodising ; but when I am out of doors , especially when I am sitting out of doors , I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain . One can not fix one ’s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy . ”
82584	82590	82592	82593	Miss Crawford	127	“ To say the truth , ”
82595	82689	82592	82593	Miss Crawford	127	“ I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV . ; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it . If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them . I have now been here nearly five months ; and , moreover , the quietest five months I ever passed . ”
82690	82701	82419	82419	Fanny	113	“ _ Too _ quiet for you , I believe . ”
82702	82715	82721	82721	she	1829	“ I should have thought so _ theoretically _ myself , but , ”
82724	82742	82721	82721	she	1829	“ take it all and all , I never spent so happy a summer . But then , ”
82752	82763	82721	82721	she	1829	“ there is no saying what it may lead to . ”
82795	82948	82782	82783	Miss Crawford	127	“ I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . I can even suppose it pleasant to spend _ half _ the year in the country , under certain circumstances , very pleasant . An elegant , moderate - sized house in the centre of family connexions ; continual engagements among them ; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood ; looked up to , perhaps , as leading it even more than those of larger fortune , and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a _ tête - à - tête _ with the person one feels most agreeable in the world . There is nothing frightful in such a picture , is there , Miss Price ? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _ that _ . ”
82949	82954	83077	83077	she	127	“ Envy Mrs. Rushworth ! ”
82963	83053	83054	83054	Fanny	113	“ Come , come , it would be very un - handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth , for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay , brilliant , happy hours . I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year . Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth ’s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . ”
83080	83087	83077	83077	she	127	“ Ah ! here he is . ”
83109	83164	83106	83107	Mrs. Grant	123	“ My sister and Mr. Bertram . I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be Mr. Bertram again . There is something in the sound of Mr. _ Edmund _ Bertram so formal , so pitiful , so younger - brother - like , that I detest it . ”
83165	83171	83173	83173	Fanny	113	“ How differently we feel ! ”
83175	83252	83173	83173	Fanny	113	“ To me , the sound of _ Mr. _ Bertram is so cold and nothing - meaning , so entirely without warmth or character ! It just stands for a gentleman , and that ’s all . But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund . It is a name of heroism and renown ; of kings , princes , and knights ; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections . ”
83253	83335	83336	83336	Edmund	108	“ I grant you the name is good in itself , and _ Lord _ Edmund or _ Sir _ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . Well , shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year , by being up before they can begin ? ”
83425	83428	83430	83431	Miss Crawford	127	“ Well , ”
83433	83472	83430	83431	Miss Crawford	127	“ and do you not scold us for our imprudence ? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it , and entreated and supplicated never to do so again ? ”
83473	83480	83482	83482	Edmund	108	“ Perhaps I might have scolded , ”
83484	83509	83482	83482	Edmund	108	“ if either of you had been sitting down alone ; but while you do wrong together , I can overlook a great deal . ”
83510	83519	83521	83522	Mrs. Grant	123	“ They can not have been sitting long , ”
83524	83547	83521	83522	Mrs. Grant	123	“ for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . ”
83548	83552	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ And really , ”
83556	83600	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar . We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May . ”
83601	83606	83608	83609	Miss Crawford	127	“ Upon my word , ”
83611	83726	83608	83609	Miss Crawford	127	“ you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with ! There is no giving you a moment ’s uneasiness . You do not know how much we have been suffering , nor what chills we have felt ! But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on , in any little manoeuvre against common sense , that a woman could be plagued with . I had very little hope of _ him _ from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . ”
83727	83923	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . You have not the smallest chance of moving me . I have my alarms , but they are quite in a different quarter ; and if I could have altered the weather , you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time — for here are some of my plants which Robert _ will _ leave out because the nights are so mild , and I know the end of it will be , that we shall have a sudden change of weather , a hard frost setting in all at once , taking everybody ( at least Robert ) by surprise , and I shall lose every one ; and what is worse , cook has just been telling me that the turkey , which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday , because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day , will not keep beyond to - morrow . These are something like grievances , and make me think the weather most unseasonably close . ”
83924	83934	83936	83937	Miss Crawford	127	“ The sweets of housekeeping in a country village ! ”
83940	83950	83936	83937	Miss Crawford	127	“ Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer . ”
83951	84001	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul ’s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . But we have no such people in Mansfield . What would you have me do ? ”
84002	84026	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ Oh ! you can do nothing but what you do already : be plagued very often , and never lose your temper . ”
84027	84105	83936	83937	Miss Crawford	127	“ Thank you ; but there is no escaping these little vexations , Mary , live where we may ; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you , I dare say I shall find you with yours , in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer , perhaps on their very account . Their remoteness and unpunctuality , or their exorbitant charges and frauds , will be drawing forth bitter lamentations . ”
84106	84150	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort . A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of . It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it . ”
84151	84159	84161	84161	Edmund	108	“ You intend to be very rich ? ”
84181	84195	84161	84161	Edmund	108	“ To be sure . Do not you ? Do not we all ? ”
84196	84255	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ I can not intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command . Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth . She has only to fix on her number of thousands a year , and there can be no doubt of their coming . My intentions are only not to be poor . ”
84256	84390	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ By moderation and economy , and bringing down your wants to your income , and all that . I understand you — and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life , with such limited means and indifferent connexions . What can _ you _ want but a decent maintenance ? You have not much time before you ; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you , or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence . Be honest and poor , by all means — but I shall not envy you ; I do not much think I shall even respect you . I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich . ”
84391	84459	84161	84161	Edmund	108	“ Your degree of respect for honesty , rich or poor , is precisely what I have no manner of concern with . I do not mean to be poor . Poverty is exactly what I have determined against . Honesty , in the something between , in the middle state of worldly circumstances , is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on . ”
84460	84492	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ But I do look down upon it , if it might have been higher . I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction . ”
84493	84511	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ But how may it rise ? How may my honesty at least rise to any distinction ? ”
84526	84529	83554	83554	Edmund	108	“ Oh ! ”
84542	84562	84538	84538	she	1834	“ You ought to be in parliament , or you should have gone into the army ten years ago . ”
84563	84612	84613	84613	he	1835	“ _ That _ is not much to the purpose now ; and as to my being in parliament , I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on . No , Miss Crawford , ”
84622	84657	84613	84613	he	1835	“ there _ are _ distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance — absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining — but they are of a different character . ”
85020	85033	85003	85003	she	127	“ but she did not suppose it would be in her power , ”
85148	85158	85160	85161	Mrs. Grant	123	“ And you know what your dinner will be , ”
85163	85180	85160	85161	Mrs. Grant	123	smiling—“the turkey , and I assure you a very fine one ; for , my dear , ”
85186	85199	85160	85161	Mrs. Grant	123	“ cook insists upon the turkey ’s being dressed to - morrow . ”
85200	85207	85209	85210	Dr. Grant	121	“ Very well , very well , ”
85212	85301	85209	85210	Dr. Grant	121	“ all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house . But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram , I dare say , would take their chance . We none of us want to hear the bill of fare . A friendly meeting , and not a fine dinner , is all we have in view . A turkey , or a goose , or a leg of mutton , or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us . ”
85370	85379	85381	85382	Lady Bertram	106	“ But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny ? ”
85384	85437	85381	85382	Lady Bertram	106	“ How came she to think of asking Fanny ? Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way . I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . Fanny , you do not want to go , do you ? ”
85438	85448	85450	85450	Edmund	108	“ If you put such a question to her , ”
85458	85491	85450	85450	Edmund	108	“ Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure , my dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . ”
85492	85527	85381	85382	Lady Bertram	106	“ I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ? She never did before . She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny . ”
85528	85539	85541	85541	Fanny	113	“ If you can not do without me , ma’am — ”
85550	85564	85541	85541	Fanny	113	“ But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . ”
85565	85574	85450	85450	Edmund	108	“ To be sure , so I shall . ”
85575	85586	85450	85450	Edmund	108	“ Suppose you take my father ’s opinion , ma’am . ”
85587	85620	85450	85450	Edmund	108	“ That ’s well thought of . So I will , Edmund . I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ”
85621	85686	85450	85450	Edmund	108	“ As you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . ”
85687	85714	85450	85450	Edmund	108	“ I do not know . We will ask him . But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . ”
85806	85822	85791	85791	she	1850	“ Sir Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you . ”
85979	85998	85974	85975	Lady Bertram	106	with—“I have something to tell you that will surprise you . Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . ”
85999	86002	86004	86005	Sir Thomas	101	“ Well , ”
86016	86030	86004	86005	Sir Thomas	101	“ Edmund wants her to go . But how can I spare her ? ”
86031	86037	86039	86040	Sir Thomas	101	“ She will be late , ”
86047	86054	86039	86040	Sir Thomas	101	“ but what is your difficulty ? ”
86084	86097	86078	86078	she	629	“ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ”
86098	86106	86108	86108	Edmund	108	“ But is it not very natural , ”
86110	86126	86108	86108	Edmund	108	“ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ”
86127	86134	86136	86137	Sir Thomas	101	“ Nothing can be more natural , ”
86144	86260	86136	86137	Sir Thomas	101	“ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . Mrs. Grant ’s shewing civility to Miss Price , to Lady Bertram ’s niece , could never want explanation . The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the _ first _ time of its being paid . Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer . She appears to feel as she ought . But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ”
86261	86272	86108	86108	Edmund	108	“ But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? ”
86273	86280	86136	86137	Sir Thomas	101	“ Indeed I think you may . ”
86281	86297	86136	86137	Sir Thomas	101	“ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ”
86298	86323	86108	86108	Edmund	108	“ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ”
86324	86336	86136	86137	Sir Thomas	101	“ Very well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . ”
86356	86389	86344	86344	Edmund	108	“ Well , Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle ’s side . He had but one opinion . You are to go . ”
86390	86401	86350	86350	his	108	“ Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , ”
86426	86450	86410	86410	she	1857	“ And yet why should I be glad ? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? ”
86613	86798	86799	86800	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Upon my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence ! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me . Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . ”
86866	87103	87104	87105	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Oh ! depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go . _ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt . And I hope you will have a very _ agreeable _ day , and find it all mighty _ delightful _ . But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an _ elegant _ lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better ! And round their enormous great wide table , too , which fills up the room so dreadfully ! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining - table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner - table here , how infinitely better it would have been ! and how much more he would have been respected ! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere . Remember that , Fanny . Five — only five to be sitting round that table . However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . ”
87114	87275	87104	87105	Mrs. Norris	105	“ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . _ That _ will never do , believe me . Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage , you are not to be taking place of her . And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses . Leave him to settle _ that _ . ”
87276	87289	87104	87105	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Yes , ma’am , I should not think of anything else . ”
87290	87381	87382	87382	Her	1865	“ And if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you . I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly . ”
87418	87432	87406	87407	Sir Thomas	101	“ Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ”
87448	87454	87456	87457	Mrs. Norris	105	“ My dear Sir Thomas ! ”
87463	87468	87456	87457	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Fanny can walk . ”
87469	87472	87474	87475	Sir Thomas	101	“ Walk ! ”
87492	87515	87474	87475	Sir Thomas	101	“ My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year ! Will twenty minutes after four suit you ? ”
87516	87521	87523	87523	Fanny	113	“ Yes , sir , ”
87581	87613	87568	87568	him	312	“ Quite unnecessary ! a great deal too kind ! But Edmund goes ; true , it is upon Edmund ’s account . I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night . ”
87720	87730	87732	87732	Edmund	108	“ Now I must look at you , Fanny , ”
87743	87775	87732	87732	Edmund	108	“ and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . What have you got on ? ”
87776	87841	87739	87741	an affectionate brother	1879	“ The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin ’s marriage . I hope it is not too fine ; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could , and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter . I hope you do not think me too fine . ”
87842	87895	87732	87732	Edmund	108	“ A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white . No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper . Your gown seems very pretty . I like these glossy spots . Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same ? ”
87913	87916	87918	87918	Edmund	108	“ Heyday ! ”
87920	87938	87918	87918	Edmund	108	“ here ’s company , here ’s a carriage ! who have they got to meet us ? ”
87949	88000	87918	87918	Edmund	108	“ ’ Tis Crawford ’s , Crawford ’s barouche , I protest ! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters . He is here , of course . This is quite a surprise , Fanny . I shall be very glad to see him . ”
88591	88609	88588	88588	he	1895	“ So ! Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! ”
88610	88634	88588	88588	he	1895	“ Yes , they have been there about a fortnight , Miss Price , have they not ? And Julia is with them . ”
88635	88648	88588	88588	he	1895	“ And Mr. Yates , I presume , is not far off . ”
88649	88698	88588	88588	he	1895	“ Mr. Yates ! Oh ! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates . I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ? I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . ”
88699	88711	88713	88713	Crawford	133	“ Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! ”
88715	88760	88713	88713	Crawford	133	“ Nobody can ever forget them . Poor fellow ! I see him now — his toil and his despair . Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ”
88769	88781	88785	88785	his	1902	“ She is too good for him — much too good . ”
88801	88894	88798	88798	he	1902	“ You were Mr. Rushworth ’s best friend . Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part — in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied — to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own ! _ He _ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . ”
88902	88913	88914	88914	he	1902	“ It is as a dream , a pleasant dream ! ”
88928	89004	88914	88914	he	1902	“ I shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure . There was such an interest , such an animation , such a spirit diffused . Everybody felt it . We were all alive . There was employment , hope , solicitude , bustle , for every hour of the day . Always some little objection , some little doubt , some little anxiety to be got over . I never was happier . ”
89013	89043	89008	89008	Fanny	113	“ Never happier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly ! Oh ! what a corrupted mind ! ”
89044	89052	89053	89053	he	1902	“ We were unlucky , Miss Price , ”
89080	89189	89190	89190	He	1902	“ we certainly were very unlucky . Another week , only one other week , would have been enough for us . I think if we had had the disposal of events — if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two , about the equinox , there would have been a difference . Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather — but only by a steady contrary wind , or a calm . I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ”
89213	89259	89201	89201	her	1903	“ As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day . My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough . ”
89331	89351	89358	89358	he	1902	“ I believe you are right . It was more pleasant than prudent . We were getting too noisy . ”
89400	89412	89384	89385	Miss Crawford	127	“ Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ”
89413	89421	89423	89423	her	1903	“ The most interesting in the world , ”
89424	89577	89578	89578	His	1905	brother—“how to make money ; how to turn a good income into a better . Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon . I find he takes orders in a few weeks . They were at it in the dining - parlour . I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off . He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with , and earned without much trouble . I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year . Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice . ”
89589	89641	89578	89578	His	1905	“ Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves . You would look rather blank , Henry , if your _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ were to be limited to seven hundred a year . ”
89642	89706	89707	89708	Miss Crawford	127	“ Perhaps I might ; but all _ that _ you know is entirely comparative . Birthright and habit must settle the business . Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet ’s family . By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it . ”
89761	89764	89766	89767	Henry Crawford	131	“ Bertram , ”
89769	89892	89766	89767	Henry Crawford	131	“ I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon . I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner . When is it to be ? Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time — as I shall do — not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil . When will it be ? You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . ”
89893	89909	89911	89911	Edmund	108	“ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ”
89913	89942	89911	89911	Edmund	108	“ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ”
89943	89950	89952	89952	Fanny	113	“ Will he not feel this ? ”
89954	89965	89952	89952	Fanny	113	“ No , he can feel nothing as he ought . ”
90335	90391	90301	90301	he	131	“ And how do you think I mean to amuse myself , Mary , on the days that I do not hunt ? I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week ; but I have a plan for the intermediate days , and what do you think it is ? ”
90392	90404	90301	90301	he	131	“ To walk and ride with me , to be sure . ”
90405	90484	90301	90301	he	131	“ Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but _ that _ would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . Besides , _ that _ would be all recreation and indulgence , without the wholesome alloy of labour , and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness . No , my plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me . ”
90485	90505	90301	90301	he	131	“ Fanny Price ! Nonsense ! No , no . You ought to be satisfied with her two cousins . ”
90506	90723	90301	90301	he	131	“ But I can not be satisfied without Fanny Price , without making a small hole in Fanny Price ’s heart . You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice . When we talked of her last night , you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks . You see her every day , and therefore do not notice it ; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn . She was then merely a quiet , modest , not plain - looking girl , but she is now absolutely pretty . I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance ; but in that soft skin of hers , so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday , there is decided beauty ; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth , I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express . And then , her air , her manner , her _ tout _ _ ensemble _ , is so indescribably improved ! She must be grown two inches , at least , since October . ”
90724	90914	90915	90915	Her	1919	“ Phoo ! phoo ! This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with , and because she has got a new gown , and you never saw her so well dressed before . She is just what she was in October , believe me . The truth is , that she was the only girl in company for you to notice , and you must have a somebody . I have always thought her pretty — not strikingly pretty — but ‘ pretty enough , ’ as people say ; a sort of beauty that grows on one . Her eyes should be darker , but she has a sweet smile ; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement , I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress , and your having nobody else to look at ; and therefore , if you do set about a flirtation with her , you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty , or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly . ”
90930	91069	90915	90915	Her	1919	“ I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny . I do not understand her . I could not tell what she would be at yesterday . What is her character ? Is she solemn ? Is she queer ? Is she prudish ? Why did she draw back and look so grave at me ? I could hardly get her to speak . I never was so long in company with a girl in my life , trying to entertain her , and succeed so ill ! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me ! I must try to get the better of this . Her looks say , ‘ I will not like you , I am determined not to like you ’ ; and I say she shall . ”
91070	91174	91353	91353	she	132	“ Foolish fellow ! And so this is her attraction after all ! This it is , her not caring about you , which gives her such a soft skin , and makes her so much taller , and produces all these charms and graces ! I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy ; a _ little _ love , perhaps , may animate and do her good , but I will not have you plunge her deep , for she is as good a little creature as ever lived , and has a great deal of feeling . ”
91175	91184	91186	91186	Henry	131	“ It can be but for a fortnight , ”
91188	91307	91186	91186	Henry	131	“ and if a fortnight can kill her , she must have a constitution which nothing could save . No , I will not do her any harm , dear little soul ! I only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again . I want nothing more . ”
91308	91312	91314	91314	Mary	132	“ Moderation itself ! ”
91316	91345	91314	91314	Mary	132	“ I can have no scruples now . Well , you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself , for we are a great deal together . ”
92985	93053	92977	92977	his	131	“ Do you know , I begin to like that queer fashion already , though when I first heard of such things being done in England , I could not believe it ; and when Mrs. Brown , and the other women at the Commissioner ’s at Gibraltar , appeared in the same trim , I thought they were mad ; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything ”
93447	93463	93439	93439	her	106	“ Dear me ! how disagreeable ! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea . ”
94160	94176	94124	94124	His	228	“ because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined , and Lady Bertram was so indolent ! ”
94481	94500	94474	94476	Luckily Sir Thomas	101	“ What shall I do , Sir Thomas ? Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ”
94538	94542	94544	94545	her ladyship	921	“ Very well , ”
94550	94573	94544	94545	her ladyship	921	“ then speculation , if you please , Mrs. Grant . I know nothing about it , but Fanny must teach me . ”
94974	94985	94952	94953	Mrs. Grant	123	“ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ”
94986	95027	94952	94953	Mrs. Grant	123	“ Oh dear , yes ! very entertaining indeed . A very odd game . I do not know what it is all about . I am never to see my cards ; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest . ”
95028	95031	95033	95033	Crawford	133	“ Bertram , ”
95050	95066	95033	95033	Crawford	133	“ I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home . ”
95119	95291	95425	95426	Thornton Lacey	231	“ I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew - trees , because I can never bear to ask ; but I have not told you that , with my usual luck — for I never do wrong without gaining by it — I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see . I was suddenly , upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field , in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills ; a small stream before me to be forded , a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right — which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place , and not a gentleman or half a gentleman ’s house to be seen excepting one — to be presumed the Parsonage — within a stone ’s throw of the said knoll and church . I found myself , in short , in Thornton Lacey . ”
95292	95298	95300	95300	Edmund	108	“ It sounds like it , ”
95302	95315	95425	95426	Thornton Lacey	231	“ but which way did you turn after passing Sewell ’s farm ? ”
95316	95365	95425	95426	Thornton Lacey	231	“ I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions ; though were I to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour , you would never be able to prove that it was _ not _ Thornton Lacey — for such it certainly was . ”
95366	95372	95425	95426	Thornton Lacey	231	“ You inquired , then ? ”
95373	95402	95425	95426	Thornton Lacey	231	“ No , I never inquire . But I _ told _ a man mending a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey , and he agreed to it . ”
95403	95424	95425	95426	Thornton Lacey	231	“ You have a good memory . I had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place . ”
95454	95457	95459	95459	Edmund	108	“ Well , ”
95461	95471	95459	95459	Edmund	108	“ and how did you like what you saw ? ”
95472	95498	95425	95426	Thornton Lacey	231	“ Very much indeed . You are a lucky fellow . There will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable . ”
95499	95554	95459	95459	Edmund	108	“ No , no , not so bad as that . The farmyard must be moved , I grant you ; but I am not aware of anything else . The house is by no means bad , and when the yard is removed , there may be a very tolerable approach to it . ”
95555	95826	95459	95459	Edmund	108	“ The farmyard must be cleared away entirely , and planted up to shut out the blacksmith ’s shop . The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north — the entrance and principal rooms , I mean , must be on that side , where the view is really very pretty ; I am sure it may be done . And _ there _ must be your approach , through what is at present the garden . You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house ; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world , sloping to the south - east . The ground seems precisely formed for it . I rode fifty yards up the lane , between the church and the house , in order to look about me ; and saw how it might all be . Nothing can be easier . The meadows beyond what _ will _ _ be _ the garden , as well as what now _ is _ , sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north - east , that is , to the principal road through the village , must be all laid together , of course ; very pretty meadows they are , finely sprinkled with timber . They belong to the living , I suppose ; if not , you must purchase them . Then the stream — something must be done with the stream ; but I could not quite determine what . I had two or three ideas . ”
95827	95837	95839	95839	Edmund	108	“ And I have two or three ideas also , ”
95841	95921	95839	95839	Edmund	108	“ and one of them is , that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice . I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty . I think the house and premises may be made comfortable , and given the air of a gentleman ’s residence , without any very heavy expense , and that must suffice me ; and , I hope , may suffice all who care about me . ”
95973	96020	95956	95956	her	127	“ There , I will stake my last like a woman of spirit . No cold prudence for me . I am not born to sit still and do nothing . If I lose the game , it shall not be from not striving for it . ”
96053	96292	96046	96046	Crawford	133	“ My plan may not be the best possible : I had not many minutes to form it in ; but you must do a good deal . The place deserves it , and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of . ( Excuse me , your ladyship must not see your cards . There , let them lie just before you . ) The place deserves it , Bertram . You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman ’s residence . _ That _ will be done by the removal of the farmyard ; for , independent of that terrible nuisance , I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman ’s residence , so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage - house — above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year . It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms , with as many roofs as windows ; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse : it is a solid , roomy , mansion - like looking house , such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation , through two centuries at least , and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in . ”
96303	96556	96298	96298	Edmund	108	“ The air of a gentleman ’s residence , therefore , you can not but give it , if you do anything . But it is capable of much more . ( Let me see , Mary ; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen ; no , no , a dozen is more than it is worth . Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen . She will have nothing to say to it . Go on , go on . ) By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character . You may raise it into a _ place _ . From being the mere gentleman ’s residence , it becomes , by judicious improvement , the residence of a man of education , taste , modern manners , good connexions . All this may be stamped on it ; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road ; especially as there is no real squire ’s house to dispute the point — a circumstance , between ourselves , to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation . _ You _ think with me , I hope ”
96567	96575	96298	96298	Edmund	108	“ Have you ever seen the place ? ”
96621	96683	96618	96618	Crawford	133	“ No , no , you must not part with the queen . You have bought her too dearly , and your brother does not offer half her value . No , no , sir , hands off , hands off . Your sister does not part with the queen . She is quite determined . The game will be yours , ”
96689	96696	96618	96618	Crawford	133	“ it will certainly be yours . ”
96697	96708	96710	96710	Edmund	108	“ And Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ”
96716	96729	96710	96710	Edmund	108	“ Poor Fanny ! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes ! ”
96730	96734	96736	96737	Miss Crawford	127	“ Mr. Bertram , ”
96744	96837	96736	96737	Miss Crawford	127	“ you know Henry to be such a capital improver , that you can not possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help . Only think how useful he was at Sotherton ! Only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive about the grounds , and see his genius take fire . There we went , and there we came home again ; and what was done there is not to be told ! ”
96883	96914	96871	96871	he	133	“ I can not say there was much done at Sotherton ; but it was a hot day , and we were all walking after each other , and bewildered . ”
96938	96976	96925	96925	he	133	“ I should be sorry to have my powers of _ planning _ judged of by the day at Sotherton . I see things very differently now . Do not think of me as I appeared then . ”
97028	97197	97018	97018	she	105	“ Sotherton ! Yes , that is a place , indeed , and we had a charming day there . William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both . Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations , and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man . They are at Brighton now , you know ; in one of the best houses there , as Mr. Rushworth ’s fine fortune gives them a right to be . I do not exactly know the distance , but when you get back to Portsmouth , if it is not very far off , you ought to go over and pay your respects to them ; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins . ”
97198	97245	97246	97247	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I should be very happy , aunt ; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head ; and if I could get so far , I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that — poor scrubby midshipman as I am . ”
97273	97331	97266	97267	Sir Thomas	101	“ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own . ”
97332	97348	97350	97350	William	228	“ I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else , ”
97778	97820	97758	97758	himself	131	“ I want to be your neighbour , Sir Thomas , as you have , perhaps , heard me telling Miss Price . May I hope for your acquiescence , and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant ? ”
97829	97879	97821	97822	Sir Thomas	101	“ It is the only way , sir , in which I could _ not _ wish you established as a permanent neighbour ; but I hope , and believe , that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey . Edmund , am I saying too much ? ”
97910	97982	97992	97993	Sir Thomas	101	“ Certainly , sir , I have no idea but of residence . But , Crawford , though I refuse you as a tenant , come to me as a friend . Consider the house as half your own every winter , and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan , and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring . ”
97983	97990	97992	97993	Sir Thomas	101	“ We shall be the losers , ”
97995	98214	97992	97993	Sir Thomas	101	“ His going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less . It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject , Mr. Crawford . But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident , and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent . Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him . But it will not . He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well - wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ”
98221	98226	98228	98229	Sir Thomas	101	“ I repeat again , ”
98231	98259	98228	98229	Sir Thomas	101	“ that Thornton Lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should _ not _ be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier . ”
98266	98270	98272	98272	Edmund	108	“ Sir Thomas , ”
98274	98299	98272	98272	Edmund	108	“ undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest . We must hope his son may prove that _ he _ knows it too . ”
98661	98668	98670	98670	William	228	“ This is the assembly night , ”
98672	98686	98670	98670	William	228	“ If I were at Portsmouth I should be at it , perhaps . ”
98687	98699	98631	98631	he	131	“ But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ”
98700	98817	98670	98670	William	228	“ No , Fanny , that I do not . I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too , when I can not have you . And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly , for I might not get a partner . The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission . One might as well be nothing as a midshipman . One _ is _ nothing , indeed . You remember the Gregorys ; they are grown up amazing fine girls , but they will hardly speak to _ me _ , because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant . ”
98818	98831	98842	98842	she	2054	“ Oh ! shame , shame ! But never mind it , William ”
98846	98979	98842	98842	she	2054	“ It is not worth minding . It is no reflection on _ you _ ; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced , more or less , in their time . You must think of that , you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor ’s share , like bad weather and hard living , only with this advantage , that there will be an end to it , that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure . When you are a lieutenant ! only think , William , when you are a lieutenant , how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind . ”
98980	99000	98842	98842	she	2054	“ I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant , Fanny . Everybody gets made but me . ”
99001	99055	99056	99056	She	2055	“ Oh ! my dear William , do not talk so ; do not be so desponding . My uncle says nothing , but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made . He knows , as well as you do , of what consequence it is . ”
99087	99096	99077	99077	each	1248	“ Are you fond of dancing , Fanny ? ”
99097	99108	98842	98842	she	2054	“ Yes , very ; only I am soon tired . ”
99109	99216	99077	99077	each	1248	“ I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance . Have you never any balls at Northampton ? I should like to see you dance , and I ’d dance with you if you _ would _ , for nobody would know who I was here , and I should like to be your partner once more . We used to jump about together many a time , did not we ? when the hand - organ was in the street ? I am a pretty good dancer in my way , but I dare say you are a better . ”
99230	99241	99220	99221	his uncle	526	“ Is not Fanny a very good dancer , sir ? ”
99310	99371	99389	99390	Henry Crawford	131	“ I am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your question . I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl ; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her , which , perhaps , we may have an opportunity of doing ere long . ”
99372	99387	99389	99390	Henry Crawford	131	“ I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance , Mr. Price , ”
99395	99419	99389	99390	Henry Crawford	131	“ and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject , to your entire satisfaction . But I believe ”
99426	99454	99389	99390	Henry Crawford	131	“ it must be at some other time . There is _ one _ person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of . ”
99615	99687	99612	99613	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Come , Fanny , Fanny , what are you about ? We are going . Do not you see your aunt is going ? Quick , quick ! I can not bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting . You should always remember the coachman and horses . My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ”
99897	99982	99894	99894	he	133	“ I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence . It would give me pleasure to see you both dance . You spoke of the balls at Northampton . Your cousins have occasionally attended them ; but they would not altogether suit us now . The fatigue would be too much for your aunt . I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball . A dance at home would be more eligible ; and if — ”
99983	99991	99993	99994	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Ah , my dear Sir Thomas ! ”
99996	100088	99993	99994	Mrs. Norris	105	“ I knew what was coming . I knew what you were going to say . If dear Julia were at home , or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton , to afford a reason , an occasion for such a thing , you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield . I know you would . If _ they _ were at home to grace the ball , a ball you would have this very Christmas . Thank your uncle , William , thank your uncle ! ”
100089	100093	100095	100096	Sir Thomas	101	“ My daughters , ”
100101	100159	100095	100096	Sir Thomas	101	“ have their pleasures at Brighton , and I hope are very happy ; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins . Could we be all assembled , our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete , but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement . ”
100376	100399	100373	100373	she	106	“ that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ”
100685	100691	100680	100680	her	105	“ how she should be dressed ”
100915	100928	100911	100911	she	106	“ there was , in fact , no trouble in the business . ”
101355	101358	101326	101326	she	127	“ Yes , ”
101362	101365	101326	101326	she	127	“ No . ”
101379	101381	101326	101326	she	127	“ no ”
101384	101386	101326	101326	she	127	“ yes ”
101461	101463	101447	101447	her	127	“ no ”
101593	101595	101615	101615	Edmund	108	“ yes ”

102137	102147	102134	102135	Miss Crawford	127	“ Shall not you wear your brother ’s cross ? ”
102295	102304	102306	102306	she	127	“ You see what a collection I have , ”
102308	102346	102306	102306	she	127	“ more by half than I ever use or think of . I do not offer them as new . I offer nothing but an old necklace . You must forgive the liberty , and oblige me . ”
102618	102631	102633	102633	she	127	“ When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you , ”
102635	102644	102633	102633	she	127	“ and feel how very kind you were . ”
102645	102660	102662	102663	Miss Crawford	127	“ You must think of somebody else too , when you wear that necklace , ”
102665	102729	102730	102730	Fanny	113	“ You must think of Henry , for it was his choice in the first place . He gave it to me , and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver . It is to be a family remembrancer . The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too . ”
102813	102818	102820	102820	she	127	“ My dear child , ”
102824	102891	102820	102820	she	127	“ what are you afraid of ? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine , and fancy you did not come honestly by it ? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ? or perhaps”—looking
102892	102915	102820	102820	she	127	archly—“you suspect a confederacy between us , and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire ? ”
102927	102932	102934	102935	Miss Crawford	127	“ Well , then , ”
102946	103143	102934	102935	Miss Crawford	127	“ to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . Its being a gift of my brother ’s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it , as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it . He is always giving me something or other . I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half . And as for this necklace , I do not suppose I have worn it six times : it is very pretty , but I never think of it ; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket - box , you have happened to fix on the very one which , if I have a choice , I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other . Say no more against it , I entreat you . Such a trifle is not worth half so many words . ”
103410	103413	103415	103415	he	133	“ Fanny , ”
103434	103614	103431	103431	his	133	“ I beg your pardon for being here . I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand . You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross . You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother ’s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton . I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny . I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends . ”
103654	103666	103649	103649	she	2125	“ Oh ! cousin , stop a moment , pray stop ! ”
103671	103680	103681	103681	she	2125	“ I can not attempt to thank you , ”
103690	103721	103681	103681	she	2125	“ thanks are out of the question . I feel much more than I can possibly express . Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond — ”
103722	103733	103681	103681	she	2125	“ If that is all you have to say , Fanny ”
103740	103755	103681	103681	she	2125	“ No , no , it is not . I want to consult you . ”
103804	103877	103796	103796	she	2125	“ Oh , this is beautiful indeed ! This is the very thing , precisely what I wished for ! This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess . It will exactly suit my cross . They must and shall be worn together . It comes , too , in such an acceptable moment . Oh , cousin , you do not know how acceptable it is . ”
103878	103966	103796	103796	she	2125	“ My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much . I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion . Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours . No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed . It is without a drawback . ”
104005	104018	103984	103984	Edmund	108	“ But what is it that you want to consult me about ? ”
104180	104251	104170	104170	he	108	“ Return the necklace ! No , my dear Fanny , upon no account . It would be mortifying her severely . There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend . Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of ? ”
104252	104265	104267	104267	Fanny	113	“ If it had been given to me in the first instance , ”
104269	104307	104267	104267	Fanny	113	“ I should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother ’s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? ”
104308	104378	104170	104170	he	108	“ She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother ’s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it . No doubt it is handsomer than mine , and fitter for a ballroom . ”
104379	104422	104170	104170	he	108	“ No , it is not handsomer , not at all handsomer in its way , and , for my purpose , not half so fit . The chain will agree with William ’s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace . ”
104423	104662	104663	104663	he	2128	“ For one night , Fanny , for only one night , if it _ be _ a sacrifice ; I am sure you will , upon consideration , make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort . Miss Crawford ’s attentions to you have been — not more than you were justly entitled to — I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure . Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to - morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions . This is my advice . I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure , and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences , resulting principally from situation , no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship . I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise , ”
104672	104683	104666	104666	his	2128	“ between the two dearest objects I have on earth . ”
105155	105169	105123	105123	she	2129	“ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ”
105336	105342	105386	105386	Bertram	108	“ My very dear Fanny , ”
106202	106215	106217	106217	she	2146	“ Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! ”
106228	106231	106269	106269	He	108	“ Fanny , ”
106274	106290	106269	106269	He	108	“ You look tired and fagged , Fanny . You have been walking too far . ”
106291	106302	106269	106269	He	108	“ No , I have not been out at all . ”
106303	106323	106324	106324	Fanny	113	“ Then you have had fatigues within doors , which are worse . You had better have gone out . ”
106391	106399	106401	106401	Edmund	108	“ I come from Dr. Grant ’s , ”
106404	106414	106401	106401	Edmund	108	“ You may guess my errand there , Fanny . ”
106438	106451	106401	106401	Edmund	108	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ”
106488	106491	106492	106492	he	108	“ Yes , ”
106495	106503	106492	106492	he	108	“ she is engaged to me ; but ”
106514	106611	106612	106612	Fanny	113	“ she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me . She is not serious . I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . She never has danced with a clergyman , she says , and she never _ will _ . For my own sake , I could wish there had been no ball just at — I mean not this very week , this very day ; to - morrow I leave home . ”
106620	106648	106612	106612	Fanny	113	“ I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . This ought to be a day of pleasure . My uncle meant it so . ”
106649	106703	106612	106612	Fanny	113	“ Oh yes , yes ! and it will be a day of pleasure . It will all end right . I am only vexed for a moment . In fact , it is not that I consider the ball as ill - timed ; what does it signify ? But , Fanny , ”
106718	106862	106612	106612	Fanny	113	“ you know what all this means . You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed . Let me talk to you a little . You are a kind , kind listener . I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it . I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem — gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong . She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul . ”
106863	106869	106871	106871	Fanny	113	“ The effect of education , ”
106882	106924	106874	106874	Edmund	108	“ Yes , that uncle and aunt ! They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . ”
106947	106991	106925	106925	Fanny	113	“ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . Do not ask advice of _ me _ . I am not competent . ”
106992	107069	106874	106874	Edmund	108	“ You are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid . It is a subject on which I should never ask advice ; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked ; and few , I imagine , do ask it , but when they want to be influenced against their conscience . I only want to talk to you . ”
107070	107110	107115	107115	her	2170	“ One thing more . Excuse the liberty ; but take care _ how _ you talk to me . Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for . The time may come — ”
107121	107125	107127	107127	Edmund	108	“ Dearest Fanny ! ”
107149	107357	107358	107358	He	2171	“ you are all considerate thought ! But it is unnecessary here . The time will never come . No such time as you allude to will ever come . I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had . You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . How many a time have we talked over her little errors ! You need not fear me ; I have almost given up every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ”
107394	107443	107391	107391	she	2172	“ Yes , cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say . Do not check yourself . Tell me whatever you like . ”
108076	108079	108081	108082	Lady Bertram	106	“ Yes , ”
108084	108096	108081	108082	Lady Bertram	106	“ she looks very well . I sent Chapman to her . ”
108097	108105	108107	108108	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Look well ! Oh , yes ! ”
108110	108204	108107	108108	Mrs. Norris	105	“ she has good reason to look well with all her advantages : brought up in this family as she has been , with all the benefit of her cousins ’ manners before her . Only think , my dear Sir Thomas , what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her . The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married . What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand ? ”
108307	108334	108291	108291	Edmund	108	“ You must dance with me , Fanny ; you must keep two dances for me ; any two that you like , except the first . ”
109175	109202	109169	109169	she	127	“ Did he ? Did Edmund ? That was like himself . No other man would have thought of it . I honour him beyond expression . ”
109334	109343	109319	109320	Sir Thomas	101	“ Yes , sir ; to Mr. Crawford , ”
109540	109549	109520	109521	Sir Thomas	101	“ It must be so , my dear , ”
110092	110101	110103	110104	Lady Bertram	106	“ Yes , she does look very well , ”
110109	110122	110126	110126	she	127	“ Chapman helped her to dress . I sent Chapman to her . ”
110190	110207	110209	110210	Mrs. Norris	105	offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ”
110332	110408	110314	110314	she	127	“ Perhaps _ you _ can tell me why my brother goes to town to - morrow ? He says he has business there , but will not tell me what . The first time he ever denied me his confidence ! But this is what we all come to . All are supplanted sooner or later . Now , I must apply to you for information . Pray , what is Henry going for ? ”
110420	110425	110427	110428	Miss Crawford	127	“ Well , then , ”
110432	110457	110427	110428	Miss Crawford	127	“ I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother , and of talking of you by the way . ”
110809	110817	110819	110819	he	131	“ I am worn out with civility , ”
110821	110866	110819	110819	he	131	“ I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say . But with _ you _ , Fanny , there may be peace . You will not want to be talked to . Let us have the luxury of silence . ”
111155	111159	111161	111161	William	228	“ Poor Fanny ! ”
111183	111219	111161	111161	William	228	“ how soon she is knocked up ! Why , the sport is but just begun . I hope we shall keep it up these two hours . How can you be tired so soon ? ”
111220	111228	111230	111231	Sir Thomas	101	“ So soon ! my good friend , ”
111241	111259	111230	111231	Sir Thomas	101	“ it is three o’clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . ”
111260	111291	111161	111161	William	228	“ Well , then , Fanny , you shall not get up to - morrow before I go . Sleep as long as you can , and never mind me . ”
111292	111297	111161	111161	William	228	“ Oh ! William . ”
111298	111312	111230	111231	Sir Thomas	101	“ What ! Did she think of being up before you set off ? ”
111313	111320	111322	111322	Fanny	113	“ Oh ! yes , sir , ”
111335	111359	111322	111322	Fanny	113	“ I must get up and breakfast with him . It will be the last time , you know ; the last morning . ”
111360	111395	111396	111396	Fanny	113	“ You had better not . He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half - past nine . Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half - past nine ? ”
111420	111425	111322	111322	Fanny	113	“ Well , well ! ”
111430	111438	111440	111440	Crawford	133	“ Yes , half - past nine , ”
111450	111472	111440	111440	Crawford	133	“ and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _ me _ . ”
111481	111510	111440	111440	Crawford	133	“ I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to - morrow . ”
111726	111728	111730	111730	his	133	“ Advise ”
111777	111784	111771	111775	the Lady of Branxholm Hall	2256	“ one moment and no more , ”
112284	112363	112265	112266	Lady Bertram	106	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her ; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ”
112380	112411	112367	112367	her	106	“ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ? did he ? I did not see _ that _ ; I should not know one from the other . ”
112475	112487	112489	112490	Lady Bertram	106	“ I can not think what is the matter with me , ”
112500	112542	112489	112490	Lady Bertram	106	“ I feel quite stupid . It must be sitting up so late last night . Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake . I can not work . Fetch the cards ; I feel so very stupid . ”
112585	112615	112616	112616	Fanny	113	game—“And _ that _ makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib . You are to deal , ma’am ; shall I deal for you ? ”
112880	112888	112890	112891	Sir Thomas	101	“ We miss our two young men , ”
112956	112965	112967	112968	Sir Thomas	101	“ And there is no reason to suppose , ”
112970	113012	112967	112968	Sir Thomas	101	“ but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent . As to Edmund , we must learn to do without him . This will be the last winter of his belonging to us , as he has done . ”
113013	113016	113018	113019	Lady Bertram	106	“ Yes , ”
113021	113048	113018	113019	Lady Bertram	106	“ but I wish he was not going away . They are all going away , I think . I wish they would stay at home . ”
113197	113199	113188	113189	Lady Bertram	106	“ Yes ”
113217	113251	113252	113253	Sir Thomas	101	“ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did , for now the others are away we feel the good of it . ”
113261	113311	113252	113253	Sir Thomas	101	“ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion . If we have been kind to _ her _ , she is now quite as necessary to _ us _ . ”
113312	113315	113317	113318	Lady Bertram	106	“ Yes , ”
113321	113338	113317	113318	Lady Bertram	106	“ and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _ her _ . ”
113356	113384	113339	113340	Sir Thomas	101	“ She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ”
113385	113451	113317	113318	Lady Bertram	106	“ And _ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas . Who should invite her ? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . ”
114212	114258	114211	114211	she	127	could—“And how do _ you _ like your cousin Edmund ’s staying away so long ? Being the only young person at home , I consider _ you _ as the greatest sufferer . You must miss him . Does his staying longer surprise you ? ”
114259	114265	114267	114267	Fanny	113	“ I do not know , ”
114270	114280	114267	114267	Fanny	113	“ Yes ; I had not particularly expected it . ”
114281	114303	114211	114211	she	127	“ Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of . It is the general way all young men do . ”
114304	114320	114211	114211	she	127	“ He did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before . ”
114321	114503	114267	114267	Fanny	113	“ He finds the house more agreeable _ now _ . He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield . I should like to have seen him once more , I confess . But you must give my compliments to him . Yes ; I think it must be compliments . Is not there a something wanted , Miss Price , in our language — a something between compliments and — and love — to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together ? So many months ’ acquaintance ! But compliments may be sufficient here . Was his letter a long one ? Does he give you much account of what he is doing ? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? ”
114504	114584	114211	114211	she	127	“ I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines . All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so . A _ few _ days longer , or _ some _ days longer ; I am not quite sure which . ”
114585	114672	114211	114211	she	127	“ Oh ! if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you . But if he wrote to his father , no wonder he was concise . Who could write chat to Sir Thomas ? If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars . You would have heard of balls and parties . He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody . How many Miss Owens are there ? ”
114673	114678	114267	114267	Fanny	113	“ Three grown up . ”
114679	114684	114211	114211	she	127	“ Are they musical ? ”
114685	114697	114211	114211	she	127	“ I do not at all know . I never heard . ”
114698	114708	114710	114711	Miss Crawford	127	“ That is the first question , you know , ”
114720	114832	114710	114711	Miss Crawford	127	“ which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another . But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies — about any three sisters just grown up ; for one knows , without being told , exactly what they are : all very accomplished and pleasing , and one very pretty . There is a beauty in every family ; it is a regular thing . Two play on the pianoforte , and one on the harp ; and all sing , or would sing if they were taught , or sing all the better for not being taught ; or something like it . ”
114833	114842	114844	114844	Fanny	113	“ I know nothing of the Miss Owens , ”
114847	114931	114844	114844	Fanny	113	“ You know nothing and you care less , as people say . Never did tone express indifference plainer . Indeed , how can one care for those one has never seen ? Well , when your cousin comes back , he will find Mansfield very quiet ; all the noisy ones gone , your brother and mine and myself . I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near . She does not like my going . ”
114938	114949	114951	114951	she	2314	“ You can not doubt your being missed by many , ”
114953	114961	114951	114951	she	2314	“ You will be very much missed . ”
114984	115060	114965	114965	her	127	“ Oh yes ! missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away ; that is , there is a great difference felt . But I am not fishing ; do n’t compliment me . If I _ am _ missed , it will appear . I may be discovered by those who want to see me . I shall not be in any doubtful , or distant , or unapproachable region . ”
115103	115108	115110	115110	she	127	“ The Miss Owens , ”
115115	115272	115110	115110	she	127	“ suppose you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey ; how should you like it ? Stranger things have happened . I dare say they are trying for it . And they are quite in the right , for it would be a very pretty establishment for them . I do not at all wonder or blame them . It is everybody ’s duty to do as well for themselves as they can . Sir Thomas Bertram ’s son is somebody ; and now he is in their own line . Their father is a clergyman , and their brother is a clergyman , and they are all clergymen together . He is their lawful property ; he fairly belongs to them . You do n’t speak , Fanny ; Miss Price , you do n’t speak . But honestly now , do not you rather expect it than otherwise ? ”
115273	115276	115278	115278	Fanny	113	“ No , ”
115281	115290	115278	115278	Fanny	113	“ I do not expect it at all . ”
115291	115296	115298	115299	Miss Crawford	127	“ Not at all ! ”
115303	115340	115278	115278	Fanny	113	“ I wonder at that . But I dare say you know exactly — I always imagine you are — perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all — or not at present . ”
115341	115348	115350	115350	Fanny	113	“ No , I do not , ”
115392	115401	115368	115369	Her companion	881	“ He is best off as he is , ”
115609	115623	115624	115624	he	131	“ My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? ”
115640	115650	115652	115652	Mary	132	“ Sitting with them an hour and a half ! ”
115664	115669	115671	115671	he	131	“ Yes , Mary , ”
115692	115740	115671	115671	he	131	“ I could not get away sooner ; Fanny looked so lovely ! I am quite determined , Mary . My mind is entirely made up . Will it astonish you ? No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ”
115855	115860	115862	115862	Henry	131	“ Yes , Mary , ”
115867	115912	115862	115862	Henry	131	“ I am fairly caught . You know with what idle designs I began ; but this is the end of them . I have , I flatter myself , made no inconsiderable progress in her affections ; but my own are entirely fixed . ”
115913	115919	115921	115921	Mary	132	“ Lucky , lucky girl ! ”
115930	116076	115921	115921	Mary	132	“ what a match for her ! My dearest Henry , this must be my _ first _ feeling ; but my _ second _ , which you shall have as sincerely , is , that I approve your choice from my soul , and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it . You will have a sweet little wife ; all gratitude and devotion . Exactly what you deserve . What an amazing match for her ! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck ; what will she say now ? The delight of all the family , indeed ! And she has some _ true _ friends in it ! How _ they _ will rejoice ! But tell me all about it ! Talk to me for ever . When did you begin to think seriously about her ? ”
116101	116110	116111	116111	he	2327	“ How the pleasing plague had stolen on him ”
116141	116175	116134	116135	his sister	511	“ Ah , my dear Henry , and this is what took you to London ! This was your business ! You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind . ”
116214	116222	116224	116224	Henry	131	“ When Fanny is known to him , ”
116226	116329	116224	116224	Henry	131	“ he will doat on her . She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . She is the very impossibility he would describe , if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas . But till it is absolutely settled — settled beyond all interference , he shall know nothing of the matter . No , Mary , you are quite mistaken . You have not discovered my business yet . ”
116330	116481	116196	116197	The Admiral	715	“ Well , well , I am satisfied . I know now to whom it must relate , and am in no hurry for the rest . Fanny Price ! wonderful , quite wonderful ! That Mansfield should have done so much for — that _ you _ should have found your fate in Mansfield ! But you are quite right ; you could not have chosen better . There is not a better girl in the world , and you do not want for fortune ; and as to her connexions , they are more than good . The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country . She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram ; that will be enough for the world . But go on , go on . Tell me more . What are your plans ? Does she know her own happiness ? ”
116482	116485	116224	116224	Henry	131	“ No . ”
116486	116493	116224	116224	Henry	131	“ What are you waiting for ? ”
116494	116523	116196	116197	The Admiral	715	“ For — for very little more than opportunity . Mary , she is not like her cousins ; but I think I shall not ask in vain . ”
116524	116632	116224	116224	Henry	131	“ Oh no ! you can not . Were you even less pleasing — supposing her not to love you already ( of which , however , I can have little doubt)—you would be safe . The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately . From my soul I do not think she would marry you _ without _ love ; that is , if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition , I can suppose it her ; but ask her to love you , and she will never have the heart to refuse . ”
116982	116993	116995	116995	he	131	“ I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , ”
116997	117007	116995	116995	he	131	“ and _ that _ is what I want . ”
117035	117043	117044	117044	she	511	“ The more I think of it , ”
117047	117114	117044	117044	she	511	“ the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed . You will both find your good in it . ”
117115	117245	117044	117044	she	511	“ It was bad , very bad in me against such a creature ; but I did not know her then ; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head . I will make her very happy , Mary ; happier than she has ever yet been herself , or ever seen anybody else . I will not take her from Northamptonshire . I shall let Everingham , and rent a place in this neighbourhood ; perhaps Stanwix Lodge . I shall let a seven years ’ lease of Everingham . I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word . I could name three people now , who would give me my own terms and thank me . ”
117246	117249	117251	117251	Mary	132	“ Ha ! ”
117253	117269	117251	117251	Mary	132	“ settle in Northamptonshire ! That is pleasant ! Then we shall be all together . ”
117331	117342	117344	117344	he	451	“ You must give us more than half your time , ”
117346	117381	117344	117344	he	451	“ I can not admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself , for we shall both have a right in you . Fanny will be so truly your sister ! ”
117413	117424	117402	117408	the guest of neither brother nor sister	2348	“ You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire ? ”
117425	117428	117344	117344	he	451	“ Yes . ”
117429	117563	117402	117408	the guest of neither brother nor sister	2348	“ That ’s right ; and in London , of course , a house of your own : no longer with the Admiral . My dearest Henry , the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his , before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions , or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life ! _ You _ are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed , look or gesture , would have broken my heart . ”
117564	117631	117632	117632	Mary	132	“ Well , well , we do not think quite alike here . The Admiral has his faults , but he is a very good man , and has been more than a father to me . Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much . You must not prejudice Fanny against him . I must have them love one another . ”
117677	117771	117665	117665	she	132	“ Henry , I think so highly of Fanny Price , that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill - used aunt had to abhor the very name , I would prevent the marriage , if possible ; but I know you : I know that a wife you _ loved _ would be the happiest of women , and that even when you ceased to love , she would yet find in you the liberality and good - breeding of a gentleman . ”
117805	117815	117816	117816	he	2354	“ Had you seen her this morning , Mary , ”
117819	117995	117816	117816	he	2354	“ attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt ’s stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman ’s service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to _ me _ , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said . Had you seen her so , Mary , you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing . ”
117996	118001	118003	118003	Mary	132	“ My dearest Henry , ”
118014	118041	118003	118003	Mary	132	“ how glad I am to see you so much in love ! It quite delights me . But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say ? ”
118042	118122	118123	118123	he	2356	“ I care neither what they say nor what they feel . They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me , that can attach a man of sense . I wish the discovery may do them any good . And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be , and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness . They will be angry , ”
118138	118282	118123	118123	he	2356	“ Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry . It will be a bitter pill to her ; that is , like other bitter pills , it will have two moments ’ ill flavour , and then be swallowed and forgotten ; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women ’s , though _ I _ was the object of them . Yes , Mary , my Fanny will feel a difference indeed : a daily , hourly difference , in the behaviour of every being who approaches her ; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it , that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due . Now she is dependent , helpless , friendless , neglected , forgotten . ”
118283	118309	118003	118003	Mary	132	“ Nay , Henry , not by all ; not forgotten by all ; not friendless or forgotten . Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . ”
118310	118391	118123	118123	he	2356	“ Edmund ! True , I believe he is , generally speaking , kind to her , and so is Sir Thomas in his way ; but it is the way of a rich , superior , long - worded , arbitrary uncle . What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do , what _ do _ they do for her happiness , comfort , honour , and dignity in the world , to what I _ shall _ do ? ”
118487	118492	118467	118467	she	106	“ Let Sir Thomas know ”
118537	118657	118658	118658	Fanny	113	“ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring . He is made . Your brother is a lieutenant . I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother ’s promotion . Here are the letters which announce it , this moment come to hand . You will , perhaps , like to see them . ”
118894	118904	118906	118906	he	131	“ I will not talk of my own happiness , ”
118908	119271	118906	118906	he	131	“ great as it is , for I think only of yours . Compared with you , who has a right to be happy ? I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world . I have not lost a moment , however . The post was late this morning , but there has not been since a moment ’s delay . How impatient , how anxious , how wild I have been on the subject , I will not attempt to describe ; how severely mortified , how cruelly disappointed , in not having it finished while I was in London ! I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it , for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield . But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire , and exerted himself immediately , there were difficulties from the absence of one friend , and the engagements of another , which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of , and knowing in what good hands I left the cause , I came away on Monday , trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these . My uncle , who is the very best man in the world , has exerted himself , as I knew he would , after seeing your brother . He was delighted with him . I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted , or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise . I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend , as this day _ does _ prove it . _ Now _ I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest , or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation , than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together . ”
119272	119284	119286	119286	Fanny	113	“ Has this been all _ your _ doing , then ? ”
119288	119333	119286	119286	Fanny	113	“ Good heaven ! how very , very kind ! Have you really — was it by _ your _ desire ? I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered . Did Admiral Crawford apply ? How was it ? I am stupefied . ”
119568	119593	119565	119565	he	131	“ How kind ! how very kind ! Oh , Mr. Crawford , we are infinitely obliged to you ! Dearest , dearest William ! ”
119608	119627	119594	119594	She	2373	“ I will go to my uncle . My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible . ”
119653	119667	119669	119669	he	131	“ She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ”
119927	119968	119915	119915	she	2373	“ Do n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t ! I beg you would not . This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me . I must go away . I can not bear it . ”
120052	120059	120060	120060	she	2373	“ No , no , no ! ”
120067	120146	120060	120060	she	2373	“ This is all nonsense . Do not distress me . I can hear no more of this . Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such — No , no , do n’t think of me . But you are _ not _ thinking of me . I know it is all nothing . ”
120815	120942	120797	120798	her aunt	463	“ MY DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _ Miss _ _ Price _ for at least the last six weeks — I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval . Go on , my dear Fanny , and without fear ; there can be no difficulties worth naming . I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something ; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon , and send him back to me even happier than he goes . Yours affectionately , M. C. ”
121277	121454	121255	121256	Mrs. Norris	105	“ _ Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too . She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin . She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it . ”
121455	121465	121467	121468	Lady Bertram	106	“ I am glad you gave him something considerable , ”
121475	121486	121467	121468	Lady Bertram	106	“ for _ I _ gave him only £ 10 . ”
121487	121490	121492	121493	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Indeed ! ”
121497	121524	121492	121493	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Upon my word , he must have gone off with his pockets well lined , and at no expense for his journey to London either ! ”
121525	121536	121537	121538	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Sir Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ”
121559	121564	121566	121566	she	105	“ It is amazing , ”
121568	121663	121566	121566	she	105	“ how much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world ! They little think how much it comes to , or what their parents , or their uncles and aunts , pay for them in the course of the year . Now , here are my sister Price ’s children ; take them all together , I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year , to say nothing of what _ I _ do for them . ”
121664	121755	121756	121756	Fanny	113	“ Very true , sister , as you say . But , poor things ! they can not help it ; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas . Fanny , William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies ; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having . I wish he may go to the East Indies , that I may have my shawl . I think I will have two shawls , Fanny . ”
122180	122218	122169	122169	his	2405	“ Have you nothing to send to Mary ? No answer to her note ? She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you . Pray write to her , if it be only a line . ”
122219	122225	122227	122227	Fanny	113	“ Oh yes ! certainly , ”
122242	122247	122169	122169	his	2405	away—“I will write directly . ”
122371	122512	122358	122358	she	2404	“ I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William . The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently . I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again . With thanks for the honour of your note , I remain , dear Miss Crawford , & c. , & c. ”
122541	122552	122554	122554	he	133	“ You can not think I mean to hurry you , ”
122572	122591	122554	122554	he	133	“ you can not think I have any such object . Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . ”
122592	122639	122554	122554	he	133	“ Oh ! I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford . ”
123302	123312	123288	123288	he	133	“ Why have you no fire to - day ? ”
123331	123350	123328	123328	She	2421	“ I am not cold , sir : I never sit here long at this time of year . ”
123351	123360	123288	123288	he	133	“ But you have a fire in general ? ”
123361	123366	123288	123288	he	133	“ No , sir . ”
123367	123461	123328	123328	She	2421	“ How comes this about ? Here must be some mistake . I understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable . In your bedchamber I know you _ can not _ have a fire . Here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified . It is highly unfit for you to sit , be it only half an hour a day , without a fire . You are not strong . You are chilly . Your aunt can not be aware of this . ”
123496	123500	123288	123288	he	133	“ my aunt Norris ”
123504	123508	123514	123514	himself	312	“ I understand , ”
123523	123848	123514	123514	himself	312	“ I understand . Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate , and very judiciously , for young people ’s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences ; but there should be moderation in everything . She is also very hardy herself , which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others . And on another account , too , I can perfectly comprehend . I know what her sentiments have always been . The principle was good in itself , but it may have been , and I believe _ has _ _ been _ , carried too far in your case . I am aware that there has been sometimes , in some points , a misplaced distinction ; but I think too well of you , Fanny , to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account . You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part , and judging partially by the event . You will take in the whole of the past , you will consider times , persons , and probabilities , and you will feel that _ they _ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which _ seemed _ to be your lot . Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary , it was kindly meant ; and of this you may be assured , that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed . I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you , by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attention that are due to her . But enough of this . Sit down , my dear . I must speak to you for a few minutes , but I will not detain you long . ”
123878	123922	123866	123867	Sir Thomas	101	“ You are not aware , perhaps , that I have had a visitor this morning . I had not been long in my own room , after breakfast , when Mr. Crawford was shewn in . His errand you may probably conjecture . ”
124186	124285	124183	124183	he	101	“ And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to . Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house . He is in my room , and hoping to see you there . ”
124315	124389	124308	124308	his	101	exclaim—“Oh ! no , sir , I can not , indeed I can not go down to him . Mr. Crawford ought to know — he must know that : I told him enough yesterday to convince him ; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday , and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me , and quite out of my power to return his good opinion . ”
124390	124398	124400	124401	Sir Thomas	101	“ I do not catch your meaning , ”
124407	124508	124400	124401	Sir Thomas	101	“ Out of your power to return his good opinion ? What is all this ? I know he spoke to you yesterday , and ( as far as I understand ) received as much encouragement to proceed as a well - judging young woman could permit herself to give . I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion ; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended . But now , when he has made his overtures so properly , and honourably — what are your scruples _ now _ ? ”
124509	124516	124518	124518	Fanny	113	“ You are mistaken , sir , ”
124537	124683	124684	124684	She	2450	“ you are quite mistaken . How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing ? I gave him no encouragement yesterday . On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again . I am sure I said as much as that and more ; and I should have said still more , if I had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously ; but I did not like to be , I could not bear to be , imputing more than might be intended . I thought it might all pass for nothing with _ him _ . ”
124696	124702	124704	124705	Sir Thomas	101	“ Am I to understand , ”
124714	124725	124704	124705	Sir Thomas	101	“ that you mean to _ refuse _ Mr. Crawford ? ”
124726	124731	124704	124705	Sir Thomas	101	“ Yes , sir . ”
124732	124736	124704	124705	Sir Thomas	101	“ Refuse him ? ”
124737	124742	124704	124705	Sir Thomas	101	“ Yes , sir . ”
124743	124756	124704	124705	Sir Thomas	101	“ Refuse Mr. Crawford ! Upon what plea ? For what reason ? ”
124757	124774	124704	124705	Sir Thomas	101	“ I — I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ”
124775	124781	124783	124784	Sir Thomas	101	“ This is very strange ! ”
124793	124930	124783	124784	Sir Thomas	101	“ There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach . Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you , with everything to recommend him : not merely situation in life , fortune , and character , but with more than common agreeableness , with address and conversation pleasing to everybody . And he is not an acquaintance of to - day ; you have now known him some time . His sister , moreover , is your intimate friend , and he has been doing _ that _ for your brother , which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you , had there been no other . It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on . He has done it already . ”
124931	124934	124936	124936	Fanny	113	“ Yes , ”
124975	124982	124984	124985	Sir Thomas	101	“ You must have been aware , ”
124988	125072	124984	124985	Sir Thomas	101	“ you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford ’s manners to you . This can not have taken you by surprise . You must have observed his attentions ; and though you always received them very properly ( I have no accusation to make on that head ) , I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you . I am half inclined to think , Fanny , that you do not quite know your own feelings . ”
125073	125094	125095	125096	Sir Thomas	101	“ Oh yes , sir ! indeed I do . His attentions were always — what I did not like . ”
125104	125110	125112	125112	he	101	“ This is beyond me , ”
125114	125139	125112	125112	he	101	“ This requires explanation . Young as you are , and having seen scarcely any one , it is hardly possible that your affections — ”
125200	125230	125196	125196	he	101	“ No , no , I know _ that _ is quite out of the question ; quite impossible . Well , there is nothing more to be said . ”
125290	125305	125307	125308	Sir Thomas	101	“ Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford ’s _ choice _ seemed to justify ”
125317	125433	125307	125308	Sir Thomas	101	“ his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me . I am an advocate for early marriages , where there are means in proportion , and would have every young man , with a sufficient income , settle as soon after four - and - twenty as he can . This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . I wish he were more likely to fix . ”
125441	125508	125307	125308	Sir Thomas	101	“ Edmund , I consider , from his dispositions and habits , as much more likely to marry early than his brother . _ He _ , indeed , I have lately thought , has seen the woman he could love , which , I am convinced , my eldest son has not . Am I right ? Do you agree with me , my dear ? ”
125509	125514	125307	125308	Sir Thomas	101	“ Yes , sir . ”
125599	125616	125586	125586	he	101	“ Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford ’s temper ? ”
125617	125622	125623	125623	She	724	“ No , sir . ”
125628	125635	125623	125623	She	724	“ But of his principles I have ”
125791	126308	125767	125768	Sir Thomas	101	“ It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you . We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference . Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting . I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed . For I _ had _ , Fanny , as I think my behaviour must have shewn , formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England . I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper , self - conceit , and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days , even in young women , and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence . But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . The advantage or disadvantage of your family , of your parents , your brothers and sisters , never seems to have had a moment ’s share in your thoughts on this occasion . How _ they _ might be benefited , how _ they _ must rejoice in such an establishment for you , is nothing to _ you _ . You think only of yourself , and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford ’s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia ’s hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria ’s to Mr. Rushworth . ”
126316	126447	126448	126448	He	2463	“ And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters , on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _ half _ the eligibility of _ this _ , immediately and peremptorily , and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation , put a decided negative on it . I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding . I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect . _ You _ are not to be judged by the same rule . You do not owe me the duty of a child . But , Fanny , if your heart can acquit you of _ ingratitude _ — ”
126543	126549	126551	126551	she	2464	“ I am very sorry , ”
126558	126565	126551	126551	she	2464	“ I am very sorry indeed . ”
126566	126593	126551	126551	she	2464	“ Sorry ! yes , I hope you are sorry ; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day ’s transactions . ”
126594	126604	126606	126606	she	2464	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ”
126613	126636	126606	126606	she	2464	“ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ”
126801	126804	126806	126806	he	101	“ Well , ”
126820	126915	126806	126806	he	101	“ well , child , dry up your tears . There is no use in these tears ; they can do no good . You must now come downstairs with me . Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already . You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments , which , unfortunately for himself , he certainly has imbibed . I am totally unequal to it . ”
127254	127358	127250	127250	he	312	“ Mr. Crawford is gone : he has just left me . I need not repeat what has passed . I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling , by an account of what he has felt . Suffice it , that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner , and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding , heart , and temper . Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . ”
127371	127375	127377	127378	her uncle	312	“ Of course , ”
127380	127539	127377	127378	her uncle	312	“ it can not be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone , be it only for five minutes ; a request too natural , a claim too just to be denied . But there is no time fixed ; perhaps to - morrow , or whenever your spirits are composed enough . For the present you have only to tranquillise yourself . Check these tears ; they do but exhaust you . If , as I am willing to suppose , you wish to shew me any observance , you will not give way to these emotions , but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind . I advise you to go out : the air will do you good ; go out for an hour on the gravel ; you will have the shrubbery to yourself , and will be the better for air and exercise . And , Fanny ”
127549	127585	127377	127378	her uncle	312	“ I shall make no mention below of what has passed ; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram . There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment ; say nothing about it yourself . ”
127876	127892	127894	127894	she	2480	“ I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! ”
127899	127907	127894	127894	she	2480	“ Heaven defend me from being ungrateful ! ”
128033	128062	128064	128064	she	2480	“ If I had known you were going out , I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny , ”
128066	128146	128064	128064	she	2480	“ which I have since , to my very great inconvenience , been obliged to go and carry myself . I could very ill spare the time , and you might have saved me the trouble , if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out . It would have made no difference to you , I suppose , whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house . ”
128147	128159	128161	128162	Sir Thomas	101	“ I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place , ”
128164	128167	128169	128170	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Oh ! ”
128178	128323	128169	128170	Mrs. Norris	105	“ that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house . Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault . If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about Fanny , I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ”
128737	128753	128722	128723	the butler	1461	“ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”
128795	128839	128790	128791	Mrs. Norris	105	“ Stay , stay , Fanny ! what are you about ? where are you going ? do n’t be in such a hurry . Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ”
128847	128901	128790	128791	Mrs. Norris	105	“ but you are so very eager to put yourself forward . What should Sir Thomas want you for ? It is me , Baddeley , you mean ; I am coming this moment . You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ”
128907	128926	128903	128903	Baddeley	215	“ No , ma’am , it is Miss Price ; I am certain of its being Miss Price . ”
128941	128954	128903	128903	Baddeley	215	“ I do not think you would answer the purpose at all . ”
130711	130861	130690	130691	Sir Thomas	101	“ Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you . He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event , you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement . With him it is entirely a matter of feeling : he claims no merit in it ; perhaps is entitled to none . Yet , having chosen so well , his constancy has a respectable stamp . Had his choice been less unexceptionable , I should have condemned his persevering . ”
130862	130867	130869	130869	Fanny	113	“ Indeed , sir , ”
130871	130925	130869	130869	Fanny	113	“ I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I have told him so , that it never will be in my power — ”
130926	130930	130932	130933	Sir Thomas	101	“ My dear , ”
130935	131156	130932	130933	Sir Thomas	101	“ there is no occasion for this . Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you . There is nothing more to be said or done . From this hour the subject is never to be revived between us . You will have nothing to fear , or to be agitated about . You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations . Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his . He proceeds at his own risk . You are on safe ground . I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant . He leaves Northamptonshire so soon , that even this slight sacrifice can not be often demanded . The future must be very uncertain . And now , my dear Fanny , this subject is closed between us . ”
131799	131804	131806	131806	she	106	“ Well , Fanny , ”
131843	131894	131832	131832	her	106	“ Well , Fanny , I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning . I must just speak of it _ once _ , I told Sir Thomas I must _ once _ , and then I shall have done . I give you joy , my dear niece . ”
131904	131914	131901	131901	she	106	“ Humph , we certainly are a handsome family ! ”
131941	132000	131937	131937	she	106	“ My dear aunt , _ you _ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure . _ You _ can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ? Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ”
132001	132075	131937	131937	she	106	“ No , my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way . I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford . And you must be aware , Fanny , that it is every young woman ’s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this . ”
132145	132154	132156	132156	she	106	“ I will tell you what , Fanny , ”
132158	132234	132156	132156	she	106	“ I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening . You did look remarkably well . Everybody said so . Sir Thomas said so . And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress . I am very glad I sent Chapman to you . I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . ”
132248	132280	132243	132243	she	106	“ And I will tell you what , Fanny , which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy . ”
133317	133328	133330	133331	his mother	629	“ We have not been so silent all the time , ”
133333	133352	133330	133331	his mother	629	“ Fanny has been reading to me , and only put the book down upon hearing you coming . ”
133378	133415	133416	133416	Crawford	133	“ She often reads to me out of those books ; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man’s — what ’s his name , Fanny?—when we heard your footsteps . ”
133421	133435	133437	133437	he	133	“ Let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship , ”
133439	133446	133437	133437	he	133	“ I shall find it immediately . ”
133918	133928	133930	133930	he	108	“ That play must be a favourite with you , ”
133932	133942	133930	133930	he	108	“ you read as if you knew it well . ”
133943	133957	133959	133959	Crawford	133	“ It will be a favourite , I believe , from this hour , ”
133961	134076	133959	133959	Crawford	133	“ but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen . I once saw Henry the Eighth acted , or I have heard of it from somebody who did , I am not certain which . But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how . It is a part of an Englishman ’s constitution . His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere ; one is intimate with him by instinct . No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately . ”
134077	134089	134091	134091	Edmund	108	“ No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , ”
134093	134181	134091	134091	Edmund	108	“ from one ’s earliest years . His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody ; they are in half the books we open , and we all talk Shakespeare , use his similes , and describe with his descriptions ; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it . To know him in bits and scraps is common enough ; to know him pretty thoroughly is , perhaps , not uncommon ; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent . ”
134182	134190	134192	134192	Crawford	133	“ Sir , you do me honour , ”
134261	134271	134273	134273	she	2581	“ It was really like being at a play , ”
134275	134284	134285	134285	Crawford	133	“ I wish Sir Thomas had been here . ”
134325	134341	134343	134344	her ladyship	921	“ You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , ”
134348	134401	134343	134344	her ladyship	921	“ and I will tell you what , I think you will have a theatre , some time or other , at your house in Norfolk . I mean when you are settled there . I do indeed . I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk . ”
134402	134408	134410	134410	he	2584	“ Do you , ma’am ? ”
134415	134439	134410	134410	he	2584	“ No , no , that will never be . Your ladyship is quite mistaken . No theatre at Everingham ! Oh no ! ”
134454	134465	134441	134441	he	2584	“ That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham . ”
134676	134682	134684	134684	Edmund	108	“ Even in my profession , ”
134690	134845	134684	134684	Edmund	108	“ how little the art of reading has been studied ! how little a clear manner , and good delivery , have been attended to ! I speak rather of the past , however , than the present . There is now a spirit of improvement abroad ; but among those who were ordained twenty , thirty , forty years ago , the larger number , to judge by their performance , must have thought reading was reading , and preaching was preaching . It is different now . The subject is more justly considered . It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths ; and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise . ”
135039	135043	135045	135045	Crawford	133	“ Our liturgy , ”
135047	135099	135045	135045	Crawford	133	“ has beauties , which not even a careless , slovenly style of reading can destroy ; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt . For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be ”
135109	135141	135045	135045	Crawford	133	“ that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . Did you speak ? ”
135159	135162	135163	135163	he	108	“ No , ”
135166	135216	135163	135163	he	108	“ Are you sure you did not speak ? I saw your lips move . I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive , and not _ allow _ my thoughts to wander . Are not you going to tell me so ? ”
135217	135235	135236	135236	She	2591	“ No , indeed , you know your duty too well for me to — even supposing — ”
135289	135491	135492	135492	Edmund	108	“ A sermon , well delivered , is more uncommon even than prayers well read . A sermon , good in itself , is no rare thing . It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well ; that is , the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study . A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect , and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself . There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers , on subjects limited , and long worn threadbare in all common hands ; who can say anything new or striking , anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste , or wearing out the feelings of his hearers , is a man whom one could not , in his public capacity , honour enough . I should like to be such a man . ”
135495	135596	135492	135492	Edmund	108	“ I should indeed . I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy . But then , I must have a London audience . I could not preach but to the educated ; to those who were capable of estimating my composition . And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . ”

135840	135927	135838	135838	he	133	“ What was it meant to express ? Disapprobation , I fear . But of what ? What had I been saying to displease you ? Did you think me speaking improperly , lightly , irreverently on the subject ? Only tell me if I was . Only tell me if I was wrong . I want to be set right . Nay , nay , I entreat you ; for one moment put down your work . What did that shake of the head mean ? ”
135932	135945	135931	135931	her	2594	“ Pray , sir , do n’t ; pray , Mr. Crawford , ”
135992	136010	135985	135985	She	2594	“ How can you , sir ? You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can — ”
136011	136017	136019	136019	he	133	“ Do I astonish you ? ”
136021	136083	136019	136019	he	133	“ Do you wonder ? Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ? I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . I will not leave you to wonder long . ”
136102	136172	136019	136019	he	133	“ You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy . Yes , that was the word . Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . I would spell it , read it , write it with anybody . I see nothing alarming in the word . Did you think I ought ? ”
136173	136178	136180	136180	Fanny	113	“ Perhaps , sir , ”
136186	136213	136214	136214	Crawford	133	speaking—“perhaps , sir , I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment . ”
136354	136357	136359	136359	Crawford	133	“ Well , ”
136371	136663	136359	136359	Crawford	133	“ I am happier than I was , because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me . You think me unsteady : easily swayed by the whim of the moment , easily tempted , easily put aside . With such an opinion , no wonder that — But we shall see.—It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged ; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady . My conduct shall speak for me ; absence , distance , time shall speak for me . _ They _ shall prove that , as far as you can be deserved by anybody , I do deserve you . You are infinitely my superior in merit ; all _ that _ I know . You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature . You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what — not merely beyond what one sees , because one never sees anything like it — but beyond what one fancies might be . But still I am not frightened . It is not by equality of merit that you can be won . That is out of the question . It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest , who loves you most devotedly , that has the best right to a return . There I build my confidence . By that right I do and will deserve you ; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it , I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes . Yes , dearest , sweetest Fanny . Nay ”
136672	136748	136359	136359	Crawford	133	“ forgive me . Perhaps I have as yet no right ; but by what other name can I call you ? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other ? No , it is ‘ Fanny ’ that I think of all day , and dream of all night . You have given the name such reality of sweetness , that nothing else can now be descriptive of you . ”
137248	137269	137298	137298	he	108	“ I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , ”
137303	137314	137316	137316	he	108	“ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ”
137318	137322	137316	137316	he	108	“ Shall I ? ”
137329	137344	137345	137345	She	319	“ It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together . ”
137361	137366	137367	137367	he	108	“ But , Fanny , ”
137371	137433	137367	137367	he	108	“ in order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together . You must talk to me . I know you have something on your mind . I know what you are thinking of . You can not suppose me uninformed . Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ? ”
137444	137464	137434	137434	Fanny	113	“ If you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . ”
137465	137519	137367	137367	he	108	“ Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them . I do not mean to press you , however . If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done . I had thought it might be a relief . ”
137520	137541	137434	137434	Fanny	113	“ I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . ”
137542	137652	137434	137434	Fanny	113	“ Do you suppose that we think differently ? I have no idea of it . I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him . Can there be any disagreement between us here ? ”
137653	137677	137367	137367	he	108	“ Oh no ! But I thought you blamed me . I thought you were against me . This is such a comfort ! ”
137678	137739	137434	137434	Fanny	113	“ This comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it . But how could you possibly suppose me against you ? How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ? Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ”
137740	137757	137434	137434	Fanny	113	“ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ”
137758	137837	137367	137367	he	108	“ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right . Can it admit of a question ? It is disgraceful to us if it does . You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . ”
137849	137915	137838	137838	Fanny	113	“ So far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise . But the matter does not end here . Crawford ’s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before . This , we know , must be a work of time . But ”
137922	137973	137992	137992	she	2609	“ let him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last . You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . ”
137974	137990	137992	137992	she	2609	“ Oh ! never , never , never ! he never will succeed with me . ”
138023	138042	138020	138020	him	108	“ Never ! Fanny!—so very determined and positive ! This is not like yourself , your rational self . ”
138043	138047	138048	138048	she	2609	“ I mean , ”
138055	138084	138048	138048	she	2609	“ that I _ think _ I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . ”
138085	138346	138020	138020	him	108	“ I must hope better things . I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation . I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him . I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for . I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny . Between us , I think we should have won you . My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed . He should have worked upon my plans . I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward . I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him — the natural wish of gratitude . You must have some feeling of that sort . You must be sorry for your own indifference . ”
138347	138354	138356	138356	Fanny	113	“ We are so totally unlike , ”
138363	138423	138356	138356	Fanny	113	“ we are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I _ could _ like him . There never were two people more dissimilar . We have not one taste in common . We should be miserable . ”
138424	138724	138728	138728	Fanny	113	“ You are mistaken , Fanny . The dissimilarity is not so strong . You are quite enough alike . You _ have _ tastes in common . You have moral and literary tastes in common . You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings ; and , Fanny , who that heard him read , and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night , will think you unfitted as companions ? You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow . He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours . It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are . His cheerfulness will counteract this . He sees difficulties nowhere : and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you . Your being so far unlike , Fanny , does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together : do not imagine it . I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance . I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike : I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits , in the manners , in the inclination for much or little company , in the propensity to talk or to be silent , to be grave or to be gay . Some opposition here is , I am thoroughly convinced , friendly to matrimonial happiness . I exclude extremes , of course ; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme . A counteraction , gentle and continual , is the best safeguard of manners and conduct . ”
138806	138972	138800	138801	Mr. Crawford	133	“ It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character . I have not thought well of him from the time of the play . I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over . ”
138973	138978	138980	138980	Edmund	108	“ My dear Fanny , ”
138989	139066	138980	138980	Edmund	108	“ let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly . The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect . Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself . Compared with me , all the rest were blameless . I was playing the fool with my eyes open . ”
139067	139072	139074	139074	Fanny	113	“ As a bystander , ”
139076	139097	139074	139074	Fanny	113	“ perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . ”
139098	139147	138980	138980	Edmund	108	“ Very possibly . No wonder . Nothing could be more improper than the whole business . I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . ”
139148	139170	138980	138980	Edmund	108	“ Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . ”
139171	139386	139074	139074	Fanny	113	“ Julia ! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it . And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters ’ good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent . I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to — there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you . And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion . It does him the highest honour ; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment . It proves him unspoilt by his uncle . It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not . ”
139387	139405	138980	138980	Edmund	108	“ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ”
139406	139580	138980	138980	Edmund	108	“ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . How could it be otherwise , with such an education and adviser ? Under the disadvantages , indeed , which both have had , is it not wonderful that they should be what they are ? Crawford ’s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides . Happily , those feelings have generally been good . You will supply the rest ; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature — to a woman who , firm as a rock in her own principles , has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them . He has chosen his partner , indeed , with rare felicity . He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything . ”
139581	139591	139593	139593	Fanny	113	“ I would not engage in such a charge , ”
139600	139609	139593	139593	Fanny	113	“ in such an office of high responsibility ! ”
139610	139700	139701	139701	Fanny	113	“ As usual , believing yourself unequal to anything ! fancying everything too much for you ! Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may . I have no common interest in Crawford ’s well - doing . Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me . You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford . ”
139733	139937	139728	139728	Edmund	108	“ I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light . I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . But it was very different . She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . We had a long talk about it . I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ”
139938	139948	139701	139701	Fanny	113	“ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ”
139949	139990	139701	139701	Fanny	113	“ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . ”
139991	140003	139728	139728	Edmund	108	“ It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ”
140004	140110	139701	139701	Fanny	113	“ Yes , she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best . You will see her , however , before she goes . She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that . She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . It is the regret and disappointment of a sister , who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for , at the first moment . She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . ”
140111	140122	139701	139701	Fanny	113	“ I knew she would be very angry with me . ”
140123	140128	140130	140130	Edmund	108	“ My dearest Fanny , ”
140139	140240	140130	140130	Edmund	108	“ do not let the idea of her anger distress you . It is anger to be talked of rather than felt . Her heart is made for love and kindness , not for resentment . I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry ’s wife . And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality . ”
140241	140261	139701	139701	Fanny	113	“ And Mrs. Grant , did she say — did she speak ; was she there all the time ? ”
140262	140365	139701	139701	Fanny	113	“ Yes , she was agreeing exactly with her sister . The surprise of your refusal , Fanny , seems to have been unbounded . That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand . I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case — you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them . But this is teasing you . I have done . Do not turn away from me . ”
140366	140374	140376	140376	Fanny	113	“ I _ should _ have thought , ”
140386	140695	140376	140376	Fanny	113	“ that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man ’s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable . Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself . But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? He took me wholly by surprise . I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford . I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . How , then , was I to be — to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ? His sisters should consider me as well as him . The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . And , and — we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . ”
140696	140922	140923	140923	Fanny	113	“ My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth . I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings . I had attributed them to you before . I thought I could understand you . You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him . Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years ’ happy marriage . ”
141055	141131	141052	141052	he	108	observed—“They go on Monday . You are sure , therefore , of seeing your friend either to - morrow or Sunday . They really go on Monday ; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day ! I had almost promised it . What a difference it might have made ! Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life . ”
141132	141139	141356	141356	he	2617	“ You were near staying there ? ”
141140	141202	141356	141356	he	2617	“ Very . I was most kindly pressed , and had nearly consented . Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . ”
141203	141211	141052	141052	he	108	“ You spent your time pleasantly there ? ”
141212	141265	141052	141052	he	108	“ Yes ; that is , it was the fault of my own mind if I did not . They were all very pleasant . I doubt their finding me so . I took uneasiness with me , and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again . ”
141266	141279	141356	141356	he	2617	“ The Miss Owens — you liked them , did not you ? ”
141280	141345	141052	141052	he	108	“ Yes , very well . Pleasant , good - humoured , unaffected girls . But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society . Good - humoured , unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . They are two distinct orders of being . You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ”
141662	141666	141668	141668	Edmund	108	“ her friend , ”
141903	141914	141882	141882	She	127	“ I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere ”
142028	142046	142020	142020	She	127	“ Sad , sad girl ! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you , ”
142159	142162	142163	142163	she	2618	“ Ha ! ”
142170	142188	142163	142163	she	2618	“ am I here again ? The East room ! Once only was I in this room before ”
142211	142290	142208	142208	she	2618	“ Once only before . Do you remember it ? I came to rehearse . Your cousin came too ; and we had a rehearsal . You were our audience and prompter . A delightful rehearsal . I shall never forget it . Here we were , just in this part of the room : here was your cousin , here was I , here were the chairs . Oh ! why will such things ever pass away ? ”
142318	142596	142309	142309	She	2618	“ The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable ! The subject of it so very — very — what shall I say ? He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me . I think I see him now , trying to be as demure and composed as Anhalt ought , through the two long speeches . ‘ When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state , matrimony may be called a happy life . ’ I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words . It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week — that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be _ that _ ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression . But alas , that very evening destroyed it all . That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle . Poor Sir Thomas , who was glad to see you ? Yet , Fanny , do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas , though I certainly did hate him for many a week . No , I do him justice now . He is just what the head of such a family should be . Nay , in sober sadness , I believe I now love you all . ”
142635	142654	142656	142656	she	2640	“ I have had a little fit since I came into this room , as you may perceive , ”
142664	142710	142656	142656	she	2640	“ but it is over now ; so let us sit down and be comfortable ; for as to scolding you , Fanny , which I came fully intending to do , I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point . ”
142717	142755	142656	142656	she	2640	“ Good , gentle Fanny ! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . ”
142780	142783	142784	142784	She	2640	“ last . ”
142822	142879	142880	142880	Fanny	113	“ I hate to leave you . I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going . Who says we shall not be sisters ? I know we shall . I feel that we are born to be connected ; and those tears convince me that you feel it too , dear Fanny . ”
142892	142915	142882	142882	herself	113	“ But you are only going from one set of friends to another . You are going to a very particular friend . ”
142916	143091	143127	143127	She	132	“ Yes , very true . Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years . But I have not the least inclination to go near her . I can think only of the friends I am leaving : my excellent sister , yourself , and the Bertrams in general . You have all so much more _ heart _ among you than one finds in the world at large . You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you , which in common intercourse one knows nothing of . I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter , a much better time for the visit , but now I can not put her off . And when I have done with her I must go to her sister , Lady Stornaway , because _ she _ was rather my most particular friend of the two , but I have not cared much for _ her _ these three years . ”
143133	143233	143127	143127	She	132	“ How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs , and setting off to find my way to the East room , without having an idea whereabouts it was ! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along , and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work ; and then your cousin ’s astonishment , when he opened the door , at seeing me here ! To be sure , your uncle ’s returning that very evening ! There never was anything quite like it . ”
143253	144078	143247	143247	she	132	“ Why , Fanny , you are absolutely in a reverie . Thinking , I hope , of one who is always thinking of you . Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend ’s sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill - tempered and _ exigeant _ , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five - and - twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill - bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . ”
144105	144232	143247	143247	she	132	“ Excellent creature ! I will not tease you . Everything shall take its course . But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies . It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be . You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . Was not he devoted to you at the ball ? And then before the ball , the necklace ! Oh ! you received it just as it was meant . You were as conscious as heart could desire . I remember it perfectly . ”
144233	144261	143247	143247	she	132	“ Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ? Oh ! Miss Crawford , _ that _ was not fair . ”
144262	144305	143247	143247	she	132	“ Knew of it ! It was his own doing entirely , his own thought . I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . ”
144306	144312	144314	144314	Fanny	113	“ I will not say , ”
144316	144515	144314	144314	Fanny	113	“ that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was . It is as true as that I sit here . And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . As to your brother ’s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind . I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ”
144516	144641	144644	144644	her	2644	“ Ah ! I can not deny it . He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ’ affections . I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one ’s power to pay off the debts of one ’s sex ! Oh ! I am sure it is not in woman ’s nature to refuse such a triumph . ”
144647	144683	144642	144642	Fanny	113	“ I can not think well of a man who sports with any woman ’s feelings ; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander - by can judge of . ”
144684	144832	144833	144833	Fanny	113	“ I do not defend him . I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife ’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . ”
144847	144859	144861	144861	Mary	132	“ I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ”
144864	144877	144878	144878	She	132	“ than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ”
144890	144903	144878	144878	She	132	“ Oh ! yes . How very , very kind of him . ”
144904	144983	144984	144985	Poor Fanny	113	“ I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move . The Admiral hates trouble , and scorns asking favours ; and there are so many young men ’s claims to be attended to in the same way , that a friendship and energy , not very determined , is easily put by . What a happy creature William must be ! I wish we could see him . ”
145053	145152	145029	145029	Mary	132	“ I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here . And I do take leave , longing for a happy reunion , and trusting that when we meet again , it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve . ”
145170	145271	145029	145029	Mary	132	“ I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you . I have two favours to ask , Fanny : one is your correspondence . You must write to me . And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone . ”
146731	146737	146745	146746	Sir Thomas	101	“ then so it shall be ”
147758	147765	147768	147769	Lady Bertram	106	“ That may be , sister , ”
147773	147793	147768	147769	Lady Bertram	106	“ I dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . ”
147871	147873	147887	147887	she	106	“ mama ”
148116	148125	148127	148127	he	228	“ I do not know how it is , ”
148129	148213	148127	148127	he	228	“ but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father ’s . The house is always in confusion . You will set things going in a better way , I am sure . You will tell my mother how it all ought to be , and you will be so useful to Susan , and you will teach Betsey , and make the boys love and mind you . How right and comfortable it will all be ! ”
148888	148933	148875	148875	Edmund	108	“ And _ I _ shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . ”
150034	150056	150057	150057	She	2777	“ The Thrush is gone out of harbour , please sir , and one of the officers has been here to — ”
150097	150193	150092	150092	himself	228	“ You are just in time . We have been looking for you this half - hour . The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . I saw her . It was a beautiful sight . And they think she will have her orders in a day or two . And Mr. Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you : he has got one of the Thrush ’s boats , and is going off to her at six , and hoped you would be here in time to go with him . ”
150494	150626	150627	150628	Her son	637	“ Oh ! my dear William , how glad I am to see you . But have you heard about the Thrush ? She is gone out of harbour already ; three days before we had any thought of it ; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam ’s things , they will never be ready in time ; for she may have her orders to - morrow , perhaps . It takes me quite unawares . And now you must be off for Spithead too . Campbell has been here , quite in a worry about you ; and now what shall we do ? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you , and here everything comes upon me at once . ”
150658	150757	150764	150765	Mrs. Price	107	“ To be sure , I had much rather she had stayed in harbour , that I might have sat a few hours with you in comfort ; but as there is a boat ashore , I had better go off at once , and there is no help for it . Whereabouts does the Thrush lay at Spithead ? Near the Canopus ? But no matter ; here ’s Fanny in the parlour , and why should we stay in the passage ? Come , mother , you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet . ”
150796	150948	150949	150949	They	2801	“ Poor dears ! how tired you must both be ! and now , what will you have ? I began to think you would never come . Betsey and I have been watching for you this half - hour . And when did you get anything to eat ? And what would you like to have now ? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea , after your journey , or else I would have got something ready . And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak , and we have no butcher at hand . It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street . We were better off in our last house . Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got . ”
150959	151015	151016	151016	Betsey	148	“ Then , Betsey , my dear , run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on ; and tell her to bring in the tea - things as soon as she can . I wish we could get the bell mended ; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger . ”
151032	151036	151038	151040	the anxious mother	2803	“ Dear me ! ”
151042	151106	151038	151040	the anxious mother	2803	“ what a sad fire we have got , and I dare say you are both starved with cold . Draw your chair nearer , my dear . I can not think what Rebecca has been about . I am sure I told her to bring some coals half an hour ago . Susan , you should have taken care of the fire . ”
151107	151118	151120	151120	Susan	264	“ I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , ”
151135	151167	151120	151120	Susan	264	“ You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room ; and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help . ”
151317	151652	151315	151315	he	228	began—“Ha ! welcome back , my boy . Glad to see you . Have you heard the news ? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . Sharp is the word , you see ! By G — , you are just in time ! The doctor has been here inquiring for you : he has got one of the boats , and is to be off for Spithead by six , so you had better go with him . I have been to Turner ’s about your mess ; it is all in a way to be done . I should not wonder if you had your orders to - morrow : but you can not sail with this wind , if you are to cruise to the westward ; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward , with the Elephant . By G — , I wish you may ! But old Scholey was saying , just now , that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel . Well , well , we are ready , whatever happens . But by G — , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour ! I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds . Old Scholey ran in at breakfast - time , to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out , I jumped up , and made but two steps to the platform . If ever there was a perfect beauty afloat , she is one ; and there she lays at Spithead , and anybody in England would take her for an eight - and - twenty . I was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her . She lays close to the Endymion , between her and the Cleopatra , just to the eastward of the sheer hulk . ”
151653	151656	151658	151658	William	228	“ Ha ! ”
151660	151694	151658	151658	William	228	“ _ that ’s _ just where I should have put her myself . It ’s the best berth at Spithead . But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , ”
151701	151712	151658	151658	William	228	“ it is so dark you do not see her . ”
152762	152813	152759	152759	he	667	“ Devil take those young dogs ! How they are singing out ! Ay , Sam ’s voice louder than all the rest ! That boy is fit for a boatswain . Holla , you there ! Sam , stop your confounded pipe , or I shall be after you . ”
153005	153013	153014	153014	she	2861	“ She had been into the kitchen , ”
153017	153059	153014	153014	she	2861	“ to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey . ”
153610	153619	153569	153570	the mother	3960	earliest—“How did sister Bertram manage about her servants ? ”
153620	153631	153569	153570	the mother	3960	“ Was she as much plagued as herself to get tolerable servants?”—soon
153735	153739	153741	153742	Mrs. Price	107	“ Her year ! ”
153744	153870	153741	153742	Mrs. Price	107	“ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . Servants are come to such a pass , my dear , in Portsmouth , that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year . I have no hope of ever being settled ; and if I was to part with Rebecca , I should only get something worse . And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , for there is always a girl under her , and I often do half the work myself . ”
154046	154056	154058	154058	Fanny	113	“ What have you got there , my love ? ”
154060	154068	154058	154058	Fanny	113	“ come and shew it to me . ”
154124	154227	154109	154109	she	264	“ It was very hard that she was not to have her _ own _ knife ; it was her own knife ; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed , and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago . But mama kept it from her , and was always letting Betsey get hold of it ; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it , and get it for her own , though mama had _ promised _ her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands . ”
154255	154260	154262	154263	Mrs. Price	107	“ Now , Susan , ”
154270	154491	154262	154263	Mrs. Price	107	“ now , how can you be so cross ? You are always quarrelling about that knife . I wish you would not be so quarrelsome . Poor little Betsey ; how cross Susan is to you ! But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer . You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it . I must hide it another time , Betsey . Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died . Poor little soul ! she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried . ’ Poor little dear ! she was so fond of it , Fanny , that she would have it lay by her in bed , all through her illness . It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death . Poor little sweet creature ! Well , she was taken away from evil to come . My own Betsey ”
154497	154526	154262	154263	Mrs. Price	107	“ _ you _ have not the luck of such a good godmother . Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you . ”
155096	155129	155086	155086	He	228	“ Take care of Fanny , mother . She is tender , and not used to rough it like the rest of us . I charge you , take care of Fanny . ”
156826	156834	156835	156835	she	148	“ And now that I have begun , ”
156838	157474	156835	156835	she	148	“ my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines _ passionnées _ from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at the same time that you were . But there he is , and , by the bye , his absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister ’s in writing , for there has been no ‘ Well , Mary , when do you write to Fanny ? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny ? ’ to spur me on . At last , after various attempts at meeting , I have seen your cousins , ‘ dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth ’ ; they found me at home yesterday , and we were glad to see each other again . We _ seemed _ _ very _ glad to see each other , and I do really think we were a little . We had a vast deal to say . Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned ? I did not use to think her wanting in self - possession , but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday . Upon the whole , Julia was in the best looks of the two , at least after you were spoken of . There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of ‘ Fanny , ’ and spoke of her as a sister should . But Mrs. Rushworth ’s day of good looks will come ; we have cards for her first party on the 28th . Then she will be in beauty , for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street . I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle ’s , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . Henry could not have afforded her such a house . I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never _ force _ your name upon her again . She will grow sober by degrees . From all that I hear and guess , Baron Wildenheim ’s attentions to Julia continue , but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement . She ought to do better . A poor honourable is no catch , and I can not imagine any liking in the case , for take away his rants , and the poor baron has nothing . What a difference a vowel makes ! If his rents were but equal to his rants ! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly ; detained , perchance , by parish duties . There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted . I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _ young _ one . Adieu ! my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry ’s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . ”

160140	160150	160108	160108	Fanny	113	“ then by this time it is all settled , ”
160194	160227	160235	160235	he	133	“ It was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise ”
160299	160325	160282	160282	she	107	“ Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ”
160335	160376	160326	160327	Mrs. Price	107	“ Her daughters were very much confined ; Portsmouth was a sad place ; they did not often get out ; and she knew they had some errands in the town , which they would be very glad to do . ”
161107	161130	161131	161131	he	133	“ Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! ”
162073	162081	162082	162082	he	133	“ Mansfield , Sotherton , Thornton Lacey , ”
162085	162157	162082	162082	he	133	“ what a society will be comprised in those houses ! And at Michaelmas , perhaps , a fourth may be added : some small hunting - box in the vicinity of everything so dear ; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey , as Edmund Bertram once good - humouredly proposed , I hope I foresee two objections : two fair , excellent , irresistible objections to that plan . ”
163554	163565	163567	163567	he	133	“ You have been here a month , I think ? ”
163569	163590	163567	163567	he	133	“ No ; not quite a month . It is only four weeks to - morrow since I left Mansfield . ”
163591	163608	163567	163567	he	133	“ You are a most accurate and honest reckoner . I should call that a month . ”
163609	163619	163567	163567	he	133	“ I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening . ”
163620	163635	163567	163567	he	133	“ And it is to be a two months ’ visit , is not ? ”
163636	163654	163567	163567	he	133	“ Yes . My uncle talked of two months . I suppose it will not be less . ”
163655	163671	163567	163567	he	133	“ And how are you to be conveyed back again ? Who comes for you ? ”
163672	163715	163567	163567	he	133	“ I do not know . I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt . Perhaps I may be to stay longer . It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months ’ end . ”
163726	163858	163860	163860	he	3169	“ I know Mansfield , I know its way , I know its faults towards _ you _ . I know the danger of your being so far forgotten , as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family . I am aware that you may be left here week after week , if Sir Thomas can not settle everything for coming himself , or sending your aunt ’s maid for you , without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year . This will not do . Two months is an ample allowance ; I should think six weeks quite enough . I am considering your sister ’s health , ”
163867	163927	163863	163863	himself	3169	“ which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to . She requires constant air and exercise . When you know her as well as I do , I am sure you will agree that she does , and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country . If , therefore ”
163935	164043	164046	164046	him	3170	“ you find yourself growing unwell , and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield , without waiting for the two months to be ended , _ that _ must not be regarded as of any consequence , if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual , and will only let my sister know it , give her only the slightest hint , she and I will immediately come down , and take you back to Mansfield . You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done . You know all that would be felt on the occasion . ”
164055	164061	164062	164062	he	3170	“ I am perfectly serious , ”
164065	164144	164062	164062	he	3170	“ as you perfectly know . And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition . Indeed , you shall _ not _ ; it shall not be in your power ; for so long only as you positively say , in every letter to Mary , ‘ I am well , ’ and I know you can not speak or write a falsehood , so long only shall you be considered as well . ”
164227	164236	164238	164238	he	3170	“ I wish you were not so tired , ”
164250	164530	164238	164238	he	3170	house—“I wish I left you in stronger health . Is there anything I can do for you in town ? I have half an idea of going into Norfolk again soon . I am not satisfied about Maddison . I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible , and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill , which I design for somebody else . I must come to an understanding with him . I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham , any more than on the north : that I will be master of my own property . I was not explicit enough with him before . The mischief such a man does on an estate , both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor , is inconceivable . I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly , and put everything at once on such a footing as can not be afterwards swerved from . Maddison is a clever fellow ; I do not wish to displace him , provided he does not try to displace _ me _ ; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me , and worse than simple to let him give me a hard - hearted , griping fellow for a tenant , instead of an honest man , to whom I have given half a promise already . Would it not be worse than simple ? Shall I go ? Do you advise it ? ”
164531	164543	164727	164727	He	3174	“ I advise ! You know very well what is right . ”
164544	164569	164727	164727	He	3174	“ Yes . When you give me your opinion , I always know what is right . Your judgment is my rule of right . ”
164570	164617	164238	164238	he	3170	“ Oh , no ! do not say so . We have all a better guide in ourselves , if we would attend to it , than any other person can be . Good - bye ; I wish you a pleasant journey to - morrow . ”
164618	164630	164727	164727	He	3174	“ Is there nothing I can do for you in town ? ”
164631	164641	164727	164727	He	3174	“ Nothing ; I am much obliged to you . ”
164642	164650	164727	164727	He	3174	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ”
164651	164693	164727	164727	He	3174	“ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ”
164694	164712	164713	164713	He	3174	“ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ”
165347	165968	165334	165334	her	3175	“ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love . I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . I have no news for you . You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin ’s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long ago ; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy . I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did — at least , one sees many worse . He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ? If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious . I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales , but — but — but Yours affectionately . ”
165969	166289	165334	165334	her	3175	“ I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund ’s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself — I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire . My dear little creature , do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks . Those vile sea - breezes are the ruin of beauty and health . My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea , which the Admiral of course never believed , but I know it was so . I am at your service and Henry ’s , at an hour ’s notice . I should like the scheme , and we would make a little circuit , and shew you Everingham in our way , and perhaps you would not mind passing through London , and seeing the inside of St. George ’s , Hanover Square . Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted . What a long letter ! one word more . Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening . The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable . He will see the Rushworths , which I own I am not sorry for — having a little curiosity , and so I think has he — though he will not acknowledge it . ”
167442	169143	169163	169163	Fanny	113	“ My Dear Fanny,—Excuse me that I have not written before . Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . Could I have sent a few happy lines , they should not have been wanting , but nothing of that nature was ever in my power . I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . My hopes are much weaker . You are probably aware of this already . So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . I will not be prevented , however , from making my own communication . Our confidences in you need not clash . I ask no questions . There is something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend , and that whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us , we are united in our love of you . It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . I have been returned since Saturday . I was three weeks in London , and saw her ( for London ) very often . I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected . I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield . It was her manner , however , rather than any unfrequency of meeting . Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered : my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . I need not particularise . You know the weak side of her character , and may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me . She was in high spirits , and surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad sense to her too lively mind . I do not like Mrs. Fraser . She is a cold - hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment not to faults of judgment , or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , Lady Stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine . They have been leading her astray for years . Could she be detached from them!—and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . I can not give her up , Fanny . She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . If I did not believe that she had some regard for me , of course I should not say this , but I do believe it . I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference . I have no jealousy of any individual . It is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of . It is the habits of wealth that I fear . Her ideas are not higher than her own fortune may warrant , but they are beyond what our incomes united could authorise . There is comfort , however , even here . I could better bear to lose her because not rich enough , than because of my profession . That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . Her prejudices , I trust , are not so strong as they were . You have my thoughts exactly as they arise , my dear Fanny ; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory , but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind . Having once begun , it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel . I can not give her up . Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny . Were it a decided thing , an actual refusal , I hope I should know how to bear it , and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart , and in the course of a few years — but I am writing nonsense . Were I refused , I must bear it ; and till I am , I can never cease to try for her . This is the truth . The only question is _ how _ ? What may be the likeliest means ? I have sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter , and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield . Even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June ; but June is at a great distance , and I believe I shall write to her . I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter . To be at an early certainty is a material object . My present state is miserably irksome . Considering everything , I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of explanation . I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser , and I at a distance unable to help my own cause . A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation , and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision , an adviser may , in an unlucky moment , lead it to do what it may afterwards regret . I must think this matter over a little . This long letter , full of my own concerns alone , will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny . The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser ’s party . I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . There is not a shadow of wavering . He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . There was marked coolness on her side . They scarcely spoke . I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . You will wish to hear my opinion of Maria ’s degree of comfort as a wife . There is no appearance of unhappiness . I hope they get on pretty well together . I dined twice in Wimpole Street , and might have been there oftener , but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother . Julia seems to enjoy London exceedingly . I had little enjoyment there , but have less here . We are not a lively party . You are very much wanted . I miss you more than I can express . My mother desires her best love , and hopes to hear from you soon . She talks of you almost every hour , and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you . My father means to fetch you himself , but it will not be till after Easter , when he has business in town . You are happy at Portsmouth , I hope , but this must not be a yearly visit . I want you at home , that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey . I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress . I think I shall certainly write . It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath ; they leave Mansfield on Monday . I am glad of it . I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody ; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.—Yours ever , my dearest Fanny . ”
169144	169161	169163	169163	Fanny	113	“ I never will , no , I certainly never will wish for a letter again , ”
169172	169203	169204	169204	Fanny	113	“ What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow ? Not till after Easter ! How shall I bear it ? And my poor aunt talking of me every hour ! ”
169272	169281	169283	169283	she	3215	“ There is no good in this delay , ”
169285	169342	169343	169343	She	3215	“ Why is not it settled ? He is blinded , and nothing will open his eyes ; nothing can , after having had truths before him so long in vain . He will marry her , and be poor and miserable . God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable ! ”
169350	169547	169343	169343	She	3215	“ ‘ So very fond of me ! ’ ’ tis nonsense all . She loves nobody but herself and her brother . Her friends leading her astray for years ! She is quite as likely to have led _ them _ astray . They have all , perhaps , been corrupting one another ; but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them , she is the less likely to have been hurt , except by their flattery . ‘ The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife . ’ I firmly believe it . It is an attachment to govern his whole life . Accepted or refused , his heart is wedded to her for ever . ‘ The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny . ’ Edmund , you do not know me . The families would never be connected if you did not connect them ! Oh ! write , write . Finish it at once . Let there be an end of this suspense . Fix , commit , condemn yourself . ”
169938	169963	169932	169933	her aunt	463	“ My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence , which I make no doubt will give you much concern ”
170159	170169	170171	170172	her ladyship	921	“ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ”
170181	170357	170171	170172	her ladyship	921	“ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me . We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on every account , and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury . As I have little doubt of your feeling for us , my dear Fanny , under these distressing circumstances , I will write again very soon . ”
170609	170706	170601	170601	she	3241	“ He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do . I am sure he has been very ill . Poor Tom ! I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me . But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . ”
170965	170979	170945	170945	she	107	“ My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . ”
171633	171681	171626	171626	Edmund	108	“ On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends . When Tom is better , I shall go . ”
171934	171944	171906	171906	her	463	“ With what intense desire she wants her home , ”
172070	172114	172063	172064	her aunt	463	“ I can not but say I much regret your being from home at this distressing time , so very trying to my spirits . I trust and hope , and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again , ”
172155	172177	172199	172199	she	463	“ When I go back into Northamptonshire , or when I return to Mansfield , I shall do so and so . ”
172951	173727	174013	174013	Fanny	113	“ Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly . This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate answer . I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park , and you , no doubt , are perfectly able to give it . One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery . I thought little of his illness at first . I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with , and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder , and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him ; but now it is confidently asserted that he is really in a decline , that the symptoms are most alarming , and that part of the family , at least , are aware of it . If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling . To have such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy . Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully . I really am quite agitated on the subject . Fanny , Fanny , I see you smile and look cunning , but , upon my honour , I never bribed a physician in my life . Poor young man ! If he is to die , there will be _ two _ poor young men less in the world ; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one , that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them . It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas , but the evil of a few days may be blotted out in part . Varnish and gilding hide many stains . It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name . With real affection , Fanny , like mine , more might be overlooked . Write to me by return of post , judge of my anxiety , and do not trifle with it . Tell me the real truth , as you have it from the fountainhead . And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own . Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous . I put it to your conscience , whether ‘ Sir Edmund ’ would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible ‘ Sir . ’ Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street . Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . I suppose Mrs. R. ’s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her . The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment . I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ? Henry is not at hand , so I have nothing to say from him . Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?—Yours ever , Mary . ”
173728	174012	174013	174013	Fanny	113	“ I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it . Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street to - day ; the old lady is come . Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond . He does it every spring . Be assured he cares for nobody but you . At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours . In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul . Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come . It will do us all good . He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park . It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience — conscientious as you are — keep away , when you have the means of returning . I have not time or patience to give half Henry ’s messages ; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is unalterable affection . ”
174304	174355	174356	174356	Her	3328	“ Her uncle , she understood , meant to fetch her ; and as her cousin ’s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . ”
174645	174812	174813	174813	Fanny	113	“ A most scandalous , ill - natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country . Depend upon it , there is some mistake , and that a day or two will clear it up ; at any rate , that Henry is blameless , and in spite of a moment ’s _ etourderie _ , thinks of nobody but you . Say not a word of it ; hear nothing , surmise nothing , whisper nothing till I write again . I am sure it will be all hushed up , and nothing proved but Rushworth ’s folly . If they are gone , I would lay my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park , and Julia with them . But why would not you let us come for you ? I wish you may not repent it.—Yours , etc . ”
175512	175526	175497	175497	his	667	“ What ’s the name of your great cousins in town , Fan ? ”
175536	175541	175497	175497	his	667	“ Rushworth , sir . ”
175542	175552	175497	175497	his	667	“ And do n’t they live in Wimpole Street ? ”
175553	175558	175497	175497	his	667	“ Yes , sir . ”
175559	175576	175497	175497	his	667	“ Then , there ’s the devil to pay among them , that ’s all ! There ”
175586	175676	175532	175532	her	3341	“ much good may such fine relations do you . I do n’t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters ; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less . But , by G — ! if she belonged to _ me _ , I ’d give her the rope ’s end as long as I could stand over her . A little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things . ”
175682	175788	175677	175677	Fanny	113	“ it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial _ fracas _ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street ; the beautiful Mrs. R. , whose name had not long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen , and who had promised to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world , having quitted her husband ’s roof in company with the well - known and captivating Mr. C. , the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R. , and it was not known even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone . ”
175789	175797	175799	175799	Fanny	113	“ It is a mistake , sir , ”
175802	175822	175823	175823	She	3366	“ it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . ”
175911	175919	175920	175920	he	228	“ It might be all a lie , ”
175923	175946	175920	175920	he	228	“ but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way , that there was no answering for anybody . ”
175947	175957	175959	175960	Mrs. Price	107	“ Indeed , I hope it is not true , ”
175963	176010	175959	175960	Mrs. Price	107	“ it would be so very shocking ! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet , I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? And it would not be ten minutes ’ work . ”
176791	177044	176789	176789	Edmund	108	“ Dear Fanny,—You know our present wretchedness . May God support you under your share ! We have been here two days , but there is nothing to be done . They can not be traced . You may not have heard of the last blow — Julia ’s elopement ; she is gone to Scotland with Yates . She left London a few hours before we entered it . At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully . Now it seems nothing ; yet it is an heavy aggravation . My father is not overpowered . More can not be hoped . He is still able to think and act ; and I write , by his desire , to propose your returning home . He is anxious to get you there for my mother ’s sake . I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this , and hope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield . My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a few months . Settle it as you like ; say what is proper ; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment ! Do justice to his meaning , however I may confuse it . You may imagine something of my present state . There is no end of the evil let loose upon us . You will see me early by the mail.—Yours , etc . ”
177719	177732	177706	177706	herself	268	“ My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ”
177785	177800	177766	177766	his	108	“ Have you breakfasted ? When shall you be ready ? Does Susan go ? ”
178323	178365	178309	178309	her	3404	“ No wonder — you must feel it — you must suffer . How a man who had once loved , could desert you ! But _ yours_—your regard was new compared with —— Fanny , think of _ me _ ! ”
178782	178792	178756	178757	Lady Bertram	106	“ Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . ”
181509	181798	181494	181494	she	127	“ ‘ I heard you were in town , ’ said she ; ‘ I wanted to see you . Let us talk over this sad business . What can equal the folly of our two relations ? ’ I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke . She felt reproved . Sometimes how quick to feel ! With a graver look and voice she then added , ‘ I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister ’s expense . ’ So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you . I can not recall all her words . I would not dwell upon them if I could . Their substance was great anger at the _ folly _ of each . She reprobated her brother ’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . Guess what I must have felt . To hear the woman whom — no harsher name than folly given ! So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? This is what the world does . For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ? Spoilt , spoilt ! ”
181814	181930	181931	181931	He	3525	“ I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever . She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure . The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short — oh , Fanny ! it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated . It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her . ”
181934	181938	181940	181940	Fanny	113	“ And what , ”
181949	181955	181940	181940	Fanny	113	“ what could you say ? ”
181956	182114	181931	181931	He	3525	“ Nothing , nothing to be understood . I was like a man stunned . She went on , began to talk of you ; yes , then she began to talk of you , regretting , as well she might , the loss of such a—. There she spoke very rationally . But she has always done justice to you . ‘ He has thrown away , ’ said she , ‘ such a woman as he will never see again . She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . ’ My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been — but what never can be now . You do not wish me to be silent ? If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I have done . ”
182122	182126	182128	182128	he	3526	“ Thank God , ”
182130	182306	182128	182128	he	3526	“ We were all disposed to wonder , but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer . She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection ; yet , even here , there was alloy , a dash of evil ; for in the midst of it she could exclaim , ‘ Why would not she have him ? It is all her fault . Simple girl ! I shall never forgive her . Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object . He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again . It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation , in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham . ’ Could you have believed it possible ? But the charm is broken . My eyes are opened . ”
182307	182310	182312	182312	Fanny	113	“ Cruel ! ”
182314	182340	182312	182312	Fanny	113	“ quite cruel . At such a moment to give way to gaiety , to speak with lightness , and to you ! Absolute cruelty . ”
182341	182541	182128	182128	he	3526	“ Cruelty , do you call it ? We differ there . No , hers is not a cruel nature . I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings . The evil lies yet deeper : in her total ignorance , unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings ; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did . She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak , as she imagined everybody else would speak . Hers are not faults of temper . She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would—. Hers are faults of principle , Fanny ; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted , vitiated mind . Perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret . Not so , however . Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do . I told her so . ”
182542	182546	182128	182128	he	3526	“ Did you ? ”
182547	182559	182312	182312	Fanny	113	“ Yes ; when I left her I told her so . ”
182560	182567	182128	182128	he	3526	“ How long were you together ? ”
182568	182614	182615	182615	He	3527	“ Five - and - twenty minutes . Well , she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them . She spoke of it , Fanny , with a steadier voice than I can . ”
182627	182909	182615	182615	He	3527	“ ‘ We must persuade Henry to marry her , ’ said she ; ‘ and what with honour , and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny , I do not despair of it . Fanny he must give up . I do not think that even _ he _ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty . My influence , which is not small shall all go that way ; and when once married , and properly supported by her own family , people of respectability as they are , she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree . In some circles , we know , she would never be admitted , but with good dinners , and large parties , there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance ; and there is , undoubtedly , more liberality and candour on those points than formerly . What I advise is , that your father be quiet . Do not let him injure his own cause by interference . Persuade him to let things take their course . If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry ’s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him . I know how he is likely to be influenced . Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . ’ ”
182957	182962	182964	182964	he	108	“ Now , Fanny , ”
182966	183788	182964	182964	he	108	“ I shall soon have done . I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished — more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , ‘ A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . ’ She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she . I looked back . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done . ”
