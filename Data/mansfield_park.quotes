1068	1126	1127	1128	Lady Bertram	103	“ What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter , a girl now nine years old , of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give ? The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing , compared with the benevolence of the action . ”
1134	1143	1145	1145	she	103	“ I think we can not do better , ”
1147	1155	1145	1145	she	103	“ let us send for the child . ”
1248	1694	1232	1233	Mrs. Norris	102	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . Having no children of my own , who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow , but the children of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions . Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle . Give a girl an education , and introduce her properly into the world , and ten to one but she has the means of settling well , without farther expense to anybody . A niece of ours , Sir Thomas , I may say , or at least of yours , would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages . I do n’t say she would be so handsome as her cousins . I dare say she would not ; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as , in all human probability , would get her a creditable establishment . You are thinking of your sons — but do not you know that , of all things upon earth , that is the least likely to happen , brought up as they would be , always together like brothers and sisters ? It is morally impossible . I never knew an instance of it . It is , in fact , the only sure way of providing against the connexion . Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief . The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect , would be enough to make either of the dear , sweet - tempered boys in love with her . But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister . ”
1695	1708	1710	1711	Sir Thomas	98	“ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ”
1713	1816	1710	1711	Sir Thomas	98	“ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each . I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ”
1817	1823	1825	1826	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I thoroughly understand you , ”
1828	2123	1825	1826	Mrs. Norris	102	“ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . Is not she a sister ’s child ? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her ? My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing . So , if you are not against it , I will write to my poor sister tomorrow , and make the proposal ; and , as soon as matters are settled , I will engage to get the child to Mansfield ; you shall have no trouble about it . My own trouble , you know , I never regard . I will send Nanny to London on purpose , and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler ’s , and the child be appointed to meet her there . They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach , under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going . I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman ’s wife or other going up . ”
2502	2519	2496	2497	Lady Bertram	103	“ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ? ”
2709	2718	2720	2721	Lady Bertram	103	“ Then she had better come to us , ”
2738	2782	2732	2733	Sir Thomas	98	“ Yes , let her home be in this house . We will endeavour to do our duty by her , and she will , at least , have the advantage of companions of her own age , and of a regular instructress . ”
2783	2787	2789	2790	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Very true , ”
2792	2988	2789	2790	Mrs. Norris	102	“ which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two — there can be no difference . I only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power . I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days . I suppose , sister , you will put the child in the little white attic , near the old nurseries . It will be much the best place for her , so near Miss Lee , and not far from the girls , and close by the housemaids , who could either of them help to dress her , you know , and take care of her clothes , for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others . Indeed , I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else . ”
2995	3007	3009	3010	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I hope she will prove a well - disposed girl , ”
3012	3026	3009	3010	Mrs. Norris	102	“ and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends . ”
3027	3035	3037	3038	Sir Thomas	98	“ Should her disposition be really bad , ”
3040	3175	3037	3038	Sir Thomas	98	“ we must not , for our own children ’s sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil . We shall probably see much to wish altered in her , and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance , some meanness of opinions , and very distressing vulgarity of manner ; but these are not incurable faults ; nor , I trust , can they be dangerous for her associates . Had my daughters been younger than herself , I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment ; but , as it is , I hope there can be nothing to fear for them , and everything to hope for her , from the association . ”
3176	3184	3186	3187	Mrs. Norris	102	“ That is exactly what I think , ”
3189	3237	3186	3187	Mrs. Norris	102	“ and what I was saying to my husband this morning . It will be an education for the child , said I , only being with her cousins ; if Miss Lee taught her nothing , she would learn to be good and clever from them . ”
3238	3249	3251	3252	Lady Bertram	103	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ”
3254	3266	3251	3252	Lady Bertram	103	“ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone . ”
3267	3280	3282	3283	Sir Thomas	98	“ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ”
3285	3427	3282	3283	Sir Thomas	98	“ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a Miss Bertram . I should wish to see them very good friends , and would , on no account , authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation ; but still they can not be equals . Their rank , fortune , rights , and expectations will always be different . It is a point of great delicacy , and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct . ”
4262	4271	4273	4274	Mrs. Norris	102	“ This is not a very promising beginning , ”
4283	4404	4273	4274	Mrs. Norris	102	“ After all that I said to her as we came along , I thought she would have behaved better ; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first . I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper — her poor mother had a good deal ; but we must make allowances for such a child — and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it was her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things . ”
4876	4882	4884	4884	he	105	“ My dear little cousin , ”
4895	4902	4884	4884	he	105	“ what can be the matter ? ”
4994	5007	4965	4965	she	102	“ no , no — not at all — no , thank you ”
5045	5058	5060	5060	he	105	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ”
5062	5117	5060	5060	he	105	“ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . ”
5201	5223	5187	5188	her mother	430	“ William did not like she should come away ; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed . ”
5224	5236	5194	5195	the darling	431	“ But William will write to you , I dare say . ”
5237	5255	5194	5195	the darling	431	“ Yes , he had promised he would , but he had told her to write first . ”
5256	5264	5187	5188	her mother	430	“ And when shall you do it ? ”
5273	5285	5265	5265	She	424	“ she did not know ; she had not any paper . ”
5286	5325	5194	5195	the darling	431	“ If that be all your difficulty , I will furnish you with paper and every other material , and you may write your letter whenever you choose . Would it make you happy to write to William ? ”
5326	5331	5194	5195	the darling	431	“ Yes , very . ”
5332	5365	5194	5195	the darling	431	“ Then let it be done now . Come with me into the breakfast - room , we shall find everything there , and be sure of having the room to ourselves . ”
5366	5378	5194	5195	the darling	431	“ But , cousin , will it go to the post ? ”
5379	5411	5194	5195	the darling	431	“ Yes , depend upon me it shall : it shall go with the other letters ; and , as your uncle will frank it , it will cost William nothing . ”
5412	5416	5418	5418	Fanny	111	“ My uncle ! ”
5425	5445	5418	5418	Fanny	111	“ Yes , when you have written the letter , I will take it to my father to frank . ”
5944	5952	5953	5953	Edmund	105	“ Fanny was good - natured enough . ”
6176	6236	6148	6148	they	3674	“ Dear mama , only think , my cousin can not put the map of Europe together — or my cousin can not tell the principal rivers in Russia — or , she never heard of Asia Minor — or she does not know the difference between water - colours and crayons!—How strange!—Did you ever hear anything so stupid ? ”
6237	6241	6242	6244	their considerate aunt	459	“ My dear , ”
6248	6271	6242	6244	their considerate aunt	459	“ it is very bad , but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself . ”
6272	6432	6242	6244	their considerate aunt	459	“ But , aunt , she is really so very ignorant!—Do you know , we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the Isle of Wight . She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight , and she calls it the Island , as if there were no other island in the world . I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself , if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is . I can not remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet . How long ago it is , aunt , since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England , with the dates of their accession , and most of the principal events of their reigns ! ”
6433	6436	6438	6439	the other	460	“ Yes , ”
6441	6476	6438	6439	the other	460	“ and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus ; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology , and all the metals , semi - metals , planets , and distinguished philosophers . ”
6477	6574	6242	6244	their considerate aunt	459	“ Very true indeed , my dears , but you are blessed with wonderful memories , and your poor cousin has probably none at all . There is a vast deal of difference in memories , as well as in everything else , and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin , and pity her deficiency . And remember that , if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves , you should always be modest ; for , much as you know already , there is a great deal more for you to learn . ”
6575	6621	6242	6244	their considerate aunt	459	“ Yes , I know there is , till I am seventeen . But I must tell you another thing of Fanny , so odd and so stupid . Do you know , she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing . ”
6622	6723	6242	6244	their considerate aunt	459	“ To be sure , my dear , that is very stupid indeed , and shows a great want of genius and emulation . But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;—on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . ”
6967	7040	7041	7041	Fanny	111	“ she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people were stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . ”
8127	8135	8137	8137	he	98	“ I blush for you , Tom , ”
8145	8275	8137	8137	he	98	“ I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ”
8403	8431	8432	8432	He	98	“ no , he was a short - necked , apoplectic sort of fellow , and , plied well with good things , would soon pop off . ”
8629	8653	8623	8623	she	525	“ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . How shall you like it ? ”
8669	8675	8623	8623	she	525	“ Going to leave you ? ”
8676	8723	8623	8623	she	525	“ Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ? You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . ”
8753	8763	8765	8765	she	525	“ I shall be very sorry to go away , ”
8772	8809	8765	8765	she	525	“ Yes , I dare say you will ; that ’s natural enough . I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . ”
8810	8820	8822	8822	Fanny	111	“ I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ”
8825	8845	8822	8822	Fanny	111	“ No , my dear ; I hope not . I have always found you a very good girl . ”
8846	8856	8765	8765	she	525	“ And am I never to live here again ? ”
8857	8891	8892	8892	Fanny	111	“ Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other . ”
8940	8943	8945	8945	she	529	“ Cousin , ”
8947	9000	8945	8945	she	529	“ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . ”
9001	9004	8934	8934	she	529	“ Indeed ! ”
9005	9047	8934	8934	she	529	“ Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . It is quite settled . I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . ”
9048	9071	8945	8945	she	529	“ Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . ”
9072	9077	8934	8934	she	529	“ Oh , cousin ! ”
9078	9147	8934	8934	she	529	“ It has everything else in its favour . My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . You will be what you ought to be to her . I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ”
9148	9183	8934	8934	she	529	“ Indeed it does : I can not like it . I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there . You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . ”
9184	9256	8934	8934	she	529	“ I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so . She never knew how to be pleasant to children . But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you must be important to her . ”
9257	9267	8934	8934	she	529	“ I can never be important to any one . ”
9268	9275	8934	8934	she	529	“ What is to prevent you ? ”
9276	9287	8934	8934	she	529	“ Everything . My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . ”
9288	9381	8934	8934	she	529	“ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . ”
9382	9388	9390	9390	Fanny	111	“ You are too kind , ”
9397	9439	9390	9390	Fanny	111	“ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . Oh ! cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ”
9440	9551	8934	8934	she	529	“ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House . You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . The two families will be meeting every day in the year . The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be . Here there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with her you will be forced to speak for yourself . ”
9552	9560	8934	8934	she	529	“ Oh ! do not say so . ”
9561	9621	9390	9390	Fanny	111	“ I must say it , and say it with pleasure . Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now . She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ”
9628	9712	9622	9622	Fanny	111	“ I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be . If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody . Here , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well . ”
9713	9791	8934	8934	she	529	“ The place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house . You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever . Even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . ”
9792	9908	8934	8934	she	529	“ Very true . Yes , dear old grey pony ! Ah ! cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle ’s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well . ”
9909	9945	9390	9390	Fanny	111	“ And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . ”
10148	10171	10145	10146	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ”
10177	10191	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Live with me , dear Lady Bertram ! what do you mean ? ”
10192	10211	10969	10970	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Is she not to live with you ? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . ”
10212	10375	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Me ! never . I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me . Fanny live with me ! the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both . Good heaven ! what could I do with Fanny ? Me ! a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ? A girl of fifteen ! the very age of all others to need most attention and care , and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test ! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing ! Sir Thomas is too much my friend . Nobody that wishes me well , I am sure , would propose it . How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ? ”
10376	10391	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Indeed , I do not know . I suppose he thought it best . ”
10392	10425	10969	10970	Mrs. Norris	102	“ But what did he say ? He could not say he wished me to take Fanny . I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . ”
10426	10477	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too . We both thought it would be a comfort to you . But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . She is no encumbrance here . ”
10478	10629	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ? Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl . She is in good hands , and sure of doing well . I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can . ”
10630	10642	10969	10970	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? ”
10643	10803	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Lady Bertram , I do not complain . I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager . I have been a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . My situation is as much altered as my income . A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me . It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers . At the White House , matters must be better looked after . I must live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more , to lay by a little at the end of the year . ”
10804	10819	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I dare say you will . You always do , do n’t you ? ”
10820	10881	10969	10970	Mrs. Norris	102	“ My object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me . It is for your children ’s good that I wish to be richer . I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . ”
10882	10913	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . They are sure of being well provided for . Sir Thomas will take care of that . ”
10914	10939	10172	10173	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Why , you know , Sir Thomas ’s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . ”
10940	10960	10969	10970	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Oh ! that will soon be settled . Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . ”
10961	10967	10969	10970	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ”
10976	11053	10969	10970	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . ”
11377	11488	11489	11490	Lady Bertram	103	“ Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself ; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in her time , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place . Her store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds . ”
11943	11983	11984	11984	He	98	“ Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! it was a shameful insensibility . ”
12042	12050	12053	12053	he	98	“ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ”
12063	12068	12053	12053	he	98	“ my dear Fanny , ”
12104	12165	12086	12086	he	98	“ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ”
12920	12923	12929	12930	her aunts	601	“ because , ”
12932	12952	12929	12930	her aunts	601	“ she might ride one of her cousin ’s horses at any time when they did not want them , ”
13112	13118	13083	13083	he	105	“ Fanny must have a horse ”
13296	13303	13325	13325	she	103	“ Fanny must have a horse , ”
13989	14013	14014	14014	she	103	“ If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , ”
14641	14659	14629	14629	he	105	company—“If this man had not twelve thousand a year , he would be a very stupid fellow . ”
15650	15654	15656	15657	Mrs. Grant	121	“ And now , ”
15659	15714	15656	15657	Mrs. Grant	121	“ I have thought of something to make it complete . I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good - humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy . ”
15721	15726	15728	15728	Mary	129	“ My dear sister , ”
15730	15891	15728	15728	Mary	129	“ if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of . If you can persuade Henry to marry , you must have the address of a Frenchwoman . All that English abilities can do has been tried already . I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable ! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined . If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry . ”
15892	15905	15656	15657	Mrs. Grant	121	“ My dear brother , I will not believe this of you . ”
15906	15988	15728	15728	Mary	129	“ No , I am sure you are too good . You will be kinder than Mary . You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience . I am of a cautious temper , and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry . Nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself . I consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet—‘Heaven ’s last best gift . ’ ”
15989	16028	15656	15657	Mrs. Grant	121	“ There , Mrs. Grant , you see how he dwells on one word , and only look at his smile . I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ”
16029	16036	16038	16039	Mrs. Grant	121	“ I pay very little regard , ”
16041	16077	16038	16039	Mrs. Grant	121	“ to what any young person says on the subject of marriage . If they profess a disinclination for it , I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person . ”
16093	16143	16078	16079	Dr. Grant	118	“ Oh yes ! I am not at all ashamed of it . I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly : I do not like to have people throw themselves away ; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage . ”
16482	16508	16473	16473	She	124	“ There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man — everybody knew her situation — Mr. Crawford must take care of himself . ”
16582	16592	16594	16594	he	130	“ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ”
16611	16620	16597	16597	he	130	“ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ”
16621	16643	16594	16594	he	130	“ So they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it . But you like Julia best . ”
16644	16653	16594	16594	he	130	“ Oh yes ! I like Julia best . ”
16654	16670	16597	16597	he	130	“ But do you really ? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest . ”
16671	16726	16594	16594	he	130	“ So I should suppose . She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ”
16727	16748	16594	16594	he	130	“ I shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you will like her best at last . ”
16749	16763	16594	16594	he	130	“ Do not I tell you that I like her best at first ? ”
16764	16785	16597	16597	he	130	“ And besides , Miss Bertram is engaged . Remember that , my dear brother . Her choice is made . ”
16786	16849	16594	16594	he	130	“ Yes , and I like her the better for it . An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged . She is satisfied with herself . Her cares are over , and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion . All is safe with a lady engaged : no harm can be done . ”
16850	16877	16594	16594	he	130	“ Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . ”
16878	16951	16594	16594	he	130	“ But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; that is your opinion of your intimate friend . I do not subscribe to it . I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth . I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart . ”
16952	16961	16597	16597	he	130	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ”
16962	16986	16594	16594	he	130	“ We must leave him to himself , I believe . Talking does no good . He will be taken in at last . ”
16987	17013	16594	16594	he	130	“ But I would not have him taken in ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . ”
17014	17045	16597	16597	he	130	“ Oh dear ! let him stand his chance and be taken in . It will do just as well . Everybody is taken in at some period or other . ”
17046	17055	16594	16594	he	130	“ Not always in marriage , dear Mary . ”
17056	17149	16594	16594	he	130	“ In marriage especially . With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry . Look where I will , I see that it is so ; and I feel that it must be so , when I consider that it is , of all transactions , the one in which people expect most from others , and are least honest themselves . ”
17150	17167	16594	16594	he	130	“ Ah ! You have been in a bad school for matrimony , in Hill Street . ”
17168	17255	16594	16594	he	130	“ My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business . I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse . What is this but a take in ? ”
17256	17385	16594	16594	he	130	“ My dear child , there must be a little imagination here . I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you . Depend upon it , you see but half . You see the evil , but you do not see the consolation . There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere , and we are all apt to expect too much ; but then , if one scheme of happiness fails , human nature turns to another ; if the first calculation is wrong , we make a second better : we find comfort somewhere — and those evil - minded observers , dearest Mary , who make much of a little , are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves . ”
17386	17434	16594	16594	he	130	“ Well done , sister ! I honour your esprit du corps . When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too . It would save me many a heartache . ”
17435	17475	16594	16594	he	130	“ You are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both . Mansfield shall cure you both , and without any taking in . Stay with us , and we will cure you . ”
18158	18171	18177	18177	she	125	“ I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price , ”
18185	18234	18177	18177	she	125	“ Pray , is she out , or is she not ? I am puzzled . She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being out ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she is . ”
18246	18291	18235	18235	Edmund	105	“ I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question . My cousin is grown up . She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me . ”
18292	18513	18177	18177	she	125	“ And yet , in general , nothing can be more easily ascertained . The distinction is so broad . Manners as well as appearance are , generally speaking , so totally different . Till now , I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl ’s being out or not . A girl not out has always the same sort of dress : a close bonnet , for instance ; looks very demure , and never says a word . You may smile , but it is so , I assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper . Girls should be quiet and modest . The most objectionable part is , that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden . They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite — to confidence ! That is the faulty part of the present system . One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing — and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before . Mr. Bertram , I dare say you have sometimes met with such changes . ”
18514	18541	18177	18177	she	125	“ I believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at . You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ”
18542	18587	18235	18235	Edmund	105	“ No , indeed . Miss Anderson ! I do not know who or what you mean . I am quite in the dark . But I will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about . ”
18588	18878	18177	18177	she	125	“ Ah ! you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed on . You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye , in describing an altered young lady . You paint too accurately for mistake . It was exactly so . The Andersons of Baker Street . We were speaking of them the other day , you know . Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson . The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it . When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not out , and I could not get her to speak to me . I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady — nothing like a civil answer — she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air ! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth . She was then out . I met her at Mrs. Holford ’s , and did not recollect her . She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story . ”
18879	18956	18177	18177	she	125	“ And a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , I dare say , than does credit to Miss Anderson . It is too common a fault . Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters . I do not know where the error lies . I do not pretend to set people right , but I do see that they are often wrong . ”
18957	18970	18972	18973	Mr. Bertram	105	“ Those who are showing the world what female manners should be , ”
18976	18987	18972	18973	Mr. Bertram	105	“ are doing a great deal to set them right . ”
18988	18995	18997	19000	the less courteous Edmund	105	“ The error is plain enough , ”
19002	19046	18997	19000	the less courteous Edmund	105	“ such girls are ill brought up . They are given wrong notions from the beginning . They are always acting upon motives of vanity , and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards . ”
19047	19053	19055	19056	Miss Crawford	125	“ I do not know , ”
19059	19119	18177	18177	she	125	“ Yes , I can not agree with you there . It is certainly the modestest part of the business . It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were , which I have seen done . That is worse than anything — quite disgusting ! ”
19120	19129	19131	19132	Mr. Bertram	105	“ Yes , that is very inconvenient indeed , ”
19134	19422	19131	19132	Mr. Bertram	105	“ It leads one astray ; one does not know what to do . The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them . I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September , just after my return from the West Indies . My friend Sneyd — you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund — his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me . When we reached Albion Place they were out ; we went after them , and found them on the pier : Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds , with others of their acquaintance . I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen . I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong . They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not out , and had most excessively offended the eldest . Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me . ”
19423	19516	18177	18177	she	125	“ That was bad indeed . Poor Miss Sneyd . Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her . To be neglected before one ’s time must be very vexatious ; but it was entirely the mother ’s fault . Miss Augusta should have been with her governess . Such half - and - half doings never prosper . But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price . Does she go to balls ? Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ”
19517	19520	19522	19522	Edmund	105	“ No , ”
19524	19561	19522	19522	Edmund	105	“ I do not think she has ever been to a ball . My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with her . ”
19562	19577	18177	18177	she	125	“ Oh ! then the point is clear . Miss Price is not out . ”
19730	19737	19738	19738	She	125	“ my friend such a one . ”
19922	19930	19932	19932	he	111	“ I wish you could see Compton , ”
19934	20011	19932	19932	he	111	“ it is the most complete thing ! I never saw a place so altered in my life . I told Smith I did not know where I was . The approach now , is one of the finest things in the country : you see the house in the most surprising manner . I declare , when I got back to Sotherton yesterday , it looked like a prison — quite a dismal old prison . ”
20012	20018	20020	20021	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Oh , for shame ! ”
20023	20039	20020	20021	Mrs. Norris	102	“ A prison indeed ? Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world . ”
20040	20081	19932	19932	he	111	“ It wants improvement , ma’am , beyond anything . I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life ; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it . ”
20082	20094	20096	20097	Mrs. Grant	121	“ No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present , ”
20106	20125	19932	19932	he	111	“ but depend upon it , Sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire . ”
20126	20136	20138	20139	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ I must try to do something with it , ”
20141	20161	20138	20139	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ but I do not know what . I hope I shall have some good friend to help me . ”
20162	20171	20173	20174	Miss Bertram	110	“ Your best friend upon such an occasion , ”
20177	20186	20173	20174	Miss Bertram	110	“ would be Mr. Repton , I imagine . ”
20187	20223	20235	20236	Mrs. Norris	102	“ That is what I was thinking of . As he has done so well by Smith , I think I had better have him at once . His terms are five guineas a day . ”
20224	20233	20235	20236	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Well , and if they were ten , ”
20238	20592	20594	20594	herself	795	“ I am sure you need not regard it . The expense need not be any impediment . If I were you , I should not think of the expense . I would have everything done in the best style , and made as nice as possible . Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do . You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it . It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre . It would be quite a burlesque . But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting . We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it . You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris ’s sad state of health . He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and that disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of . If it had not been for that , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done . We were always doing something as it was . It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris ’s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall , which is now grown such a noble tree , and getting to such perfection , sir , ”
20600	20612	20614	20615	Dr. Grant	118	“ The tree thrives well , beyond a doubt , madam , ”
20617	20643	20614	20615	Dr. Grant	118	“ The soil is good ; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering . ”
20644	20699	20710	20711	Dr. Grant	118	“ Sir , it is a Moor Park , we bought it as a Moor Park , and it cost us — that is , it was a present from Sir Thomas , but I saw the bill — and I know it cost seven shillings , and was charged as a Moor Park . ”
20700	20708	20710	20711	Dr. Grant	118	“ You were imposed on , ma’am , ”
20713	20756	20710	20711	Dr. Grant	118	“ these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree . It is an insipid fruit at the best ; but a good apricot is eatable , which none from my garden are . ”
20757	20764	20766	20767	Mrs. Grant	121	“ The truth is , ma’am , ”
20779	20842	20776	20777	Mrs. Norris	102	“ that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all . ”
20905	20937	20900	20901	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ Smith ’s place is the admiration of all the country ; and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand . I think I shall have Repton . ”
20938	20942	20944	20945	Lady Bertram	103	“ Mr. Rushworth , ”
20947	20973	20944	20945	Lady Bertram	103	“ if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather . ”
21087	21222	21229	21229	he	800	“ Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds , which is little enough , and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved . Now , at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred , without reckoning the water meadows ; so that I think , if so much could be done at Compton , we need not despair . There have been two or three fine old trees cut down , that grew too near the house , and it opens the prospect amazingly , which makes me think that Repton , or anybody of that sort , would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down : the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill , you know , ”
21242	21262	21263	21263	Fanny	111	“ The avenue ! Oh ! I do not recollect it . I really know very little of Sotherton . ”
21299	21332	21333	21333	He	800	“ Cut down an avenue ! What a pity ! Does it not make you think of Cowper ? ‘ Ye fallen avenues , once more I mourn your fate unmerited . ’ ”
21339	21352	21333	21333	He	800	“ I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance , Fanny . ”
21353	21388	21333	21333	He	800	“ I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down , to see the place as it is now , in its old state ; but I do not suppose I shall . ”
21389	21422	21333	21333	He	800	“ Have you never been there ? No , you never can ; and , unluckily , it is out of distance for a ride . I wish we could contrive it . ”
21423	21447	21333	21333	He	800	“ Oh ! it does not signify . Whenever I do see it , you will tell me how it has been altered . ”
21448	21452	21454	21455	Miss Crawford	125	“ I collect , ”
21457	21479	21454	21455	Miss Crawford	125	“ that Sotherton is an old place , and a place of some grandeur . In any particular style of building ? ”
21480	21595	21333	21333	He	800	“ The house was built in Elizabeth ’s time , and is a large , regular , brick building ; heavy , but respectable looking , and has many good rooms . It is ill placed . It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park ; in that respect , unfavourable for improvement . But the woods are fine , and there is a stream , which , I dare say , might be made a good deal of . Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well . ”
21607	21623	21605	21605	herself	125	“ He is a well - bred man ; he makes the best of it . ”
21624	21634	21635	21635	he	801	“ I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth , ”
21638	21692	21635	21635	he	801	“ but , had I a place to new fashion , I should not put myself into the hands of an improver . I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty , of my own choice , and acquired progressively . I would rather abide by my own blunders than by his . ”
21693	21780	21605	21605	herself	125	“ You would know what you were about , of course ; but that would not suit me . I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters , but as they are before me ; and had I a place of my own in the country , I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it , and give me as much beauty as he could for my money ; and I should never look at it till it was complete . ”
21781	21796	21798	21798	Fanny	111	“ It would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all , ”
21800	21972	21798	21798	Fanny	111	“ Ay , you have been brought up to it . It was no part of my education ; and the only dose I ever had , being administered by not the first favourite in the world , has made me consider improvements in hand as the greatest of nuisances . Three years ago the Admiral , my honoured uncle , bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in ; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures ; but it being excessively pretty , it was soon found necessary to be improved , and for three months we were all dirt and confusion , without a gravel walk to step on , or a bench fit for use . I would have everything as complete as possible in the country , shrubberies and flower - gardens , and rustic seats innumerable : but it must all be done without my care . Henry is different ; he loves to be doing . ”
22026	22030	22032	22032	she	125	“ Mr. Bertram , ”
22034	22079	22032	22032	she	125	“ I have tidings of my harp at last . I am assured that it is safe at Northampton ; and there it has probably been these ten days , in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary . ”
22087	22164	22080	22080	Edmund	105	“ The truth is , that our inquiries were too direct ; we sent a servant , we went ourselves : this will not do seventy miles from London ; but this morning we heard of it in the right way . It was seen by some farmer , and he told the miller , and the miller told the butcher , and the butcher ’s son - in - law left word at the shop . ”
22165	22190	22032	22032	she	125	“ I am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and hope there will be no further delay . ”
22191	22245	22032	22032	she	125	“ I am to have it to - morrow ; but how do you think it is to be conveyed ? Not by a wagon or cart : oh no ! nothing of that kind could be hired in the village . I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow . ”
22246	22277	22032	22032	she	125	“ You would find it difficult , I dare say , just now , in the middle of a very late hay harvest , to hire a horse and cart ? ”
22278	22455	22032	22032	she	125	“ I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it ! To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so I told my maid to speak for one directly ; and as I can not look out of my dressing - closet without seeing one farmyard , nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another , I thought it would be only ask and have , and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all . Guess my surprise , when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable , most impossible thing in the world ; had offended all the farmers , all the labourers , all the hay in the parish ! As for Dr. Grant ’s bailiff , I believe I had better keep out of his way ; and my brother - in - law himself , who is all kindness in general , looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at . ”
22456	22536	22032	22032	she	125	“ You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before ; but when you do think of it , you must see the importance of getting in the grass . The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose : our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out ; but , in harvest , it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse . ”
22537	22620	22032	22032	she	125	“ I shall understand all your ways in time ; but , coming down with the true London maxim , that everything is to be got with money , I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs . However , I am to have my harp fetched to - morrow . Henry , who is good - nature itself , has offered to fetch it in his barouche . Will it not be honourably conveyed ? ”
22657	22669	22671	22672	Miss Crawford	125	“ I shall be most happy to play to you both , ”
22674	22791	22671	22672	Miss Crawford	125	“ at least as long as you can like to listen : probably much longer , for I dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off , for she is gratified in more ways than one . Now , Mr. Bertram , if you write to your brother , I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come : he heard so much of my misery about it . And you may say , if you please , that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return , in compassion to his feelings , as I know his horse will lose . ”
22792	22819	22032	22032	she	125	“ If I write , I will say whatever you wish me ; but I do not , at present , foresee any occasion for writing . ”
22820	23019	22671	22672	Miss Crawford	125	“ No , I dare say , nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth , would you ever write to him , nor he to you , if it could be helped . The occasion would never be foreseen . What strange creatures brothers are ! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world ; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill , or such a relation dead , it is done in the fewest possible words . You have but one style among you . I know it perfectly . Henry , who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be , who loves me , consults me , confides in me , and will talk to me by the hour together , has never yet turned the page in a letter ; and very often it is nothing more than—‘Dear Mary , I am just arrived . Bath seems full , and everything as usual . Yours sincerely . ’ That is the true manly style ; that is a complete brother ’s letter . ”
23020	23032	23034	23034	Fanny	111	“ When they are at a distance from all their family , ”
23042	23049	23034	23034	Fanny	111	“ they can write long letters . ”
23050	23059	23061	23061	Edmund	105	“ Miss Price has a brother at sea , ”
23063	23078	23061	23061	Edmund	105	“ whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us . ”
23079	23095	23096	23096	Fanny	111	“ At sea , has she ? In the king ’s service , of course ? ”
23167	23178	23180	23180	Edmund	105	“ Do you know anything of my cousin ’s captain ? ”
23182	23198	23180	23180	Edmund	105	“ Captain Marshall ? You have a large acquaintance in the navy , I conclude ? ”
23199	23208	23139	23139	she	804	“ Among admirals , large enough ; but , ”
23215	23334	23335	23335	Edmund	105	“ we know very little of the inferior ranks . Post - captains may be very good sort of men , but they do not belong to us . Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal : of them and their flags , and the gradation of their pay , and their bickerings and jealousies . But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used . Certainly , my home at my uncle ’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals . Of Rears and Vices I saw enough . Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat . ”
23344	23351	23335	23335	Edmund	105	“ It is a noble profession . ”
23352	23402	23139	23139	she	804	“ Yes , the profession is well enough under two circumstances : if it make the fortune , and there be discretion in spending it ; but , in short , it is not a favourite profession of mine . It has never worn an amiable form to me . ”
23459	23540	23455	23457	Miss Julia Bertram	110	“ My dear Henry , have you nothing to say ? You have been an improver yourself , and from what I hear of Everingham , it may vie with any place in England . Its natural beauties , I am sure , are great . Everingham , as it used to be , was perfect in my estimation : such a happy fall of ground , and such timber ! What would I not give to see it again ! ”
23541	23557	23559	23559	his	809	“ Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it , ”
23562	23628	23559	23559	his	809	“ but I fear there would be some disappointment : you would not find it equal to your present ideas . In extent , it is a mere nothing ; you would be surprised at its insignificance ; and , as for improvement , there was very little for me to do — too little : I should like to have been busy much longer . ”
23629	23639	23641	23641	Julia	110	“ You are fond of the sort of thing ? ”
23643	23747	23641	23641	Julia	110	“ Excessively ; but what with the natural advantages of the ground , which pointed out , even to a very young eye , what little remained to be done , and my own consequent resolutions , I had not been of age three months before Everingham was all that it is now . My plan was laid at Westminster , a little altered , perhaps , at Cambridge , and at one - and - twenty executed . I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him . I have been a devourer of my own . ”
23748	23762	23764	23764	Julia	110	“ Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , ”
23766	23787	23764	23764	Julia	110	“ You can never want employment . Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth , you should assist him with your opinion . ”
23961	24168	23930	23931	Mrs. Norris	102	“ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? Why should not we make a little party ? Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight . I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you . ”
24203	24217	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford now ? ”
24233	24241	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ How did you like her yesterday ? ”
24242	24277	23930	23931	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Very well — very much . I like to hear her talk . She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her . ”
24278	24314	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ It is her countenance that is so attractive . She has a wonderful play of feature ! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? ”
24315	24384	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ Oh yes ! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did . I was quite astonished . An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son . I could not have believed it ! ”
24385	24401	23930	23931	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I thought you would be struck . It was very wrong ; very indecorous . ”
24402	24410	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ And very ungrateful , I think . ”
24411	24552	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ Ungrateful is a strong word . I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’s memory which misleads her here . She is awkwardly circumstanced . With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford , without throwing a shade on the Admiral . I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely . I do not censure her opinions ; but there certainly is impropriety in making them public . ”
24553	24559	24561	24561	Fanny	111	“ Do not you think , ”
24568	24607	24561	24561	Fanny	111	“ that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? She can not have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral . ”
24608	24681	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ That is a fair remark . Yes , we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt ; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under . But I think her present home must do her good . Mrs. Grant ’s manners are just what they ought to be . She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection . ”
24682	24773	24219	24219	Edmund	105	“ Yes , except as to his writing her such short letters . She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated . I am sure William would never have used me so , under any circumstances . And what right had she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were absent ? ”
24774	24868	24561	24561	Fanny	111	“ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of . There she can not be justified . I am glad you saw it all as I did . ”
26454	26460	26462	26463	Miss Crawford	125	“ My dear Miss Price , ”
26475	26546	26468	26468	she	696	“ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ”
26567	26588	26590	26590	he	105	“ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ”
26592	26654	26590	26590	he	105	“ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then . I wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise . I wish you had saved yourself this walk home . ”
26655	26672	26674	26674	she	696	“ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ”
26684	26746	26674	26674	she	696	“ I am very strong . Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like . Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . ”
26846	26863	26865	26865	he	872	“ It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding ! ”
26867	26924	26865	26865	he	872	“ I never see one sit a horse better . She did not seem to have a thought of fear . Very different from you , miss , when you first began , six years ago come next Easter . Lord bless you ! how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! ”
26983	26992	26994	26994	Julia	110	“ I was sure she would ride well , ”
26996	27014	26994	26994	Julia	110	“ she has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother ’s . ”
27015	27018	27020	27020	Maria	124	“ Yes , ”
27022	27057	27020	27020	Maria	124	“ and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . ”
27075	27090	27092	27092	her	125	“ No , I do not know — not if you want the mare , ”
27095	27106	27108	27108	he	105	“ I do not want her at all for myself , ”
27110	27218	27108	27108	he	105	“ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short . She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . But any morning will do for this . She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you . It would be very wrong if she did . She rides only for pleasure ; you for health . ”
27219	27230	27232	27232	Fanny	111	“ I shall not ride to - morrow , certainly , ”
27234	27262	27232	27232	Fanny	111	“ I have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home . You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . ”
27722	27734	27715	27715	Edmund	105	“ But where is Fanny ? Is she gone to bed ? ”
27735	27744	27746	27747	Mrs. Norris	102	“ No , not that I know of , ”
27749	27757	27758	27758	Her	102	“ she was here a moment ago . ”
27792	27911	27787	27788	Mrs. Norris	102	“ That is a very foolish trick , Fanny , to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa . Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as we do ? If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket . There is all the new calico , that was bought last week , not touched yet . I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out . You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ”
27961	27982	27937	27937	Julia	110	“ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ”
27983	27986	27988	27988	Edmund	105	“ Fanny , ”
27996	28005	27988	27988	Edmund	105	“ I am sure you have the headache . ”
28020	28027	28028	28028	he	105	“ I can hardly believe you , ”
28031	28046	28028	28028	he	105	“ I know your looks too well . How long have you had it ? ”
28047	28061	27937	27937	Julia	110	“ Since a little before dinner . It is nothing but the heat . ”
28062	28071	28028	28028	he	105	“ Did you go out in the heat ? ”
28072	28082	28084	28085	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Go out ! to be sure she did , ”
28087	28120	28084	28085	Mrs. Norris	102	“ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? Were not we all out ? Even your mother was out to - day for above an hour . ”
28121	28128	28130	28131	her ladyship	902	“ Yes , indeed , Edmund , ”
28147	28208	28139	28140	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I was out above an hour . I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot . It was shady enough in the alcove , but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again . ”
28209	28219	28084	28085	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Fanny has been cutting roses , has she ? ”
28220	28257	28139	28140	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Yes , and I am afraid they will be the last this year . Poor thing ! She found it hot enough ; but they were so full - blown that one could not wait . ”
28258	28268	28270	28271	Mrs. Norris	102	“ There was no help for it , certainly , ”
28279	28340	28270	28271	Mrs. Norris	102	“ but I question whether her headache might not be caught then , sister . There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun ; but I dare say it will be well to - morrow . Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled . ”
28341	28347	28349	28350	Lady Bertram	103	“ She has got it , ”
28352	28369	28349	28350	Lady Bertram	103	“ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ”
28370	28373	28375	28375	Edmund	105	“ What ! ”
28377	28410	28375	28375	Edmund	105	“ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ? No wonder her head aches . ”
28423	28435	28437	28438	Lady Bertram	103	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ”
28440	28465	28437	28438	Lady Bertram	103	“ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home . ”
28466	28479	28349	28350	Lady Bertram	103	“ But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? ”
28480	28523	28524	28524	Edmund	105	“ No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again . ”
28535	28564	28524	28524	Edmund	105	“ And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ? Upon my word , ma’am , it has been a very ill - managed business . ”
28565	28582	28584	28585	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , ”
28593	28749	28584	28585	Mrs. Norris	102	“ unless I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother ’s dairymaid , by her desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ? ”
28750	28761	28524	28524	Edmund	105	“ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ”
28762	28878	28584	28585	Mrs. Norris	102	“ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon . She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk . If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her . But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot . Between ourselves , Edmund , ”
28885	28906	28584	28585	Mrs. Norris	102	“ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . ”
28907	28916	28921	28922	Lady Bertram	103	“ I am afraid it was , indeed , ”
28929	28984	28921	28922	Lady Bertram	103	“ I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody . It was as much as I could bear myself . Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower - beds , was almost too much for me . ”
29669	29808	29654	29655	Mrs. Norris	102	“ The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . Ten miles there , and ten back , you know . You must excuse my sister on this occasion , and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her . Sotherton is the only place that could give her a wish to go so far , but it can not be , indeed . She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . He can go on horseback , you know . ”
29828	29880	29654	29655	Mrs. Norris	102	“ The loss of her ladyship ’s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , and it was a pity she should not see the place . ”
29881	29896	29898	29899	Mrs. Norris	102	“ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ”
29901	29943	29898	29899	Mrs. Norris	102	“ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . ”
29944	29955	29956	29957	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ Oh no ! I can not do without Fanny . ”
30170	30177	30179	30179	Edmund	105	“ But why is it necessary , ”
30181	30241	30179	30179	Edmund	105	“ that Crawford ’s carriage , or his only , should be employed ? Why is no use to be made of my mother ’s chaise ? I could not , when the scheme was first mentioned the other day , understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family . ”
30242	30245	30247	30247	Julia	110	“ What ! ”
30249	30282	30247	30247	Julia	110	“ go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do . ”
30283	30286	30288	30288	Maria	124	“ Besides , ”
30290	30315	30288	30288	Maria	124	“ I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . ”
30316	30323	30325	30326	Mrs. Norris	102	“ And , my dear Edmund , ”
30328	30399	30325	30326	Mrs. Norris	102	“ taking out two carriages when one will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . ”
30400	30415	30417	30417	Maria	124	“ That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford ’s , ”
30419	30458	30417	30417	Maria	124	“ but the truth is , that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow , and does not know how to drive . I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday . ”
30459	30471	30473	30473	Edmund	105	“ There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , ”
30475	30483	30473	30473	Edmund	105	“ in going on the barouche box . ”
30484	30487	30489	30489	Maria	124	“ Unpleasant ! ”
30491	30531	30489	30489	Maria	124	“ oh dear ! I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat . There can be no comparison as to one ’s view of the country . Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche - box herself . ”
30532	30560	30473	30473	Edmund	105	“ There can be no objection , then , to Fanny ’s going with you ; there can be no doubt of your having room for her . ”
30561	30564	30566	30567	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Fanny ! ”
30569	30601	30566	30567	Mrs. Norris	102	“ my dear Edmund , there is no idea of her going with us . She stays with her aunt . I told Mrs. Rushworth so . She is not expected . ”
30602	30614	30616	30616	he	932	“ You can have no reason , I imagine , madam , ”
30622	30662	30616	30616	he	932	“ for wishing Fanny not to be of the party , but as it relates to yourself , to your own comfort . If you could do without her , you would not wish to keep her at home ? ”
30663	30677	30566	30567	Mrs. Norris	102	“ To be sure not , but I can not do without her . ”
30678	30696	30566	30567	Mrs. Norris	102	“ You can , if I stay at home with you , as I mean to do . ”
30706	30709	30710	30710	he	932	“ Yes , ”
30713	30775	30710	30710	he	932	“ there is no necessity for my going , and I mean to stay at home . Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton . I know she wishes it very much . She has not often a gratification of the kind , and I am sure , ma’am , you would be glad to give her the pleasure now ? ”
30776	30790	30791	30792	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Oh yes ! very glad , if your aunt sees no objection . ”
31049	31077	31030	31031	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Very well , very well , just as you chuse , settle it your own way , I am sure I do not care about it . ”
31078	31084	31086	31086	Maria	124	“ It seems very odd , ”
31088	31100	31086	31086	Maria	124	“ that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ”
31101	31115	31117	31117	Julia	110	“ I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ”
31141	31153	31155	31155	Edmund	105	“ Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires , ”
31477	31526	31471	31471	she	121	“ As there are five of you , it will be better that one should sit with Henry ; and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive , Julia , I think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson . ”
31824	31828	31860	31861	Mr. Crawford	130	“ there he is ”
31947	31964	31935	31935	she	110	“ her view of the country was charming , she wished they could all see it , ”
31998	32032	31977	31978	Miss Crawford	125	“ Here is a fine burst of country . I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; ”
32113	32120	32121	32121	she	110	“ those woods belonged to Sotherton , ”
32127	32146	32121	32121	she	110	“ she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth ’s property on each side of the road , ”
32189	32414	32415	32416	Miss Crawford	125	“ Now we shall have no more rough road , Miss Crawford ; our difficulties are over . The rest of the way is such as it ought to be . Mr. Rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate . Here begins the village . Those cottages are really a disgrace . The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome . I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places . The annoyance of the bells must be terrible . There is the parsonage : a tidy - looking house , and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people . Those are almshouses , built by some of the family . To the right is the steward ’s house ; he is a very respectable man . Now we are coming to the lodge - gates ; but we have nearly a mile through the park still . It is not ugly , you see , at this end ; there is some fine timber , but the situation of the house is dreadful . We go down hill to it for half a mile , and it is a pity , for it would not be an ill - looking place if it had a better approach . ”
32500	32517	32518	32518	she	125	“ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ”
32521	32559	32518	32518	she	125	“ Now , where is the avenue ? The house fronts the east , I perceive . The avenue , therefore , must be at the back of it . Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front . ”
32560	32609	32518	32518	she	125	“ Yes , it is exactly behind the house ; begins at a little distance , and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds . You may see something of it here — something of the more distant trees . It is oak entirely . ”
32832	32859	32860	32861	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments , might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure . ”
33260	33263	33265	33266	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ Now , ”
33268	33312	33265	33266	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ we are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me . ”
33369	33374	33376	33376	she	143	“ I am disappointed , ”
33386	33450	33376	33376	she	143	“ This is not my idea of a chapel . There is nothing awful here , nothing melancholy , nothing grand . Here are no aisles , no arches , no inscriptions , no banners . No banners , cousin , to be ‘ blown by the night wind of heaven . ’ No signs that a ‘ Scottish monarch sleeps below . ’ ”
33451	33517	33376	33376	she	143	“ You forget , Fanny , how lately all this has been built , and for how confined a purpose , compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries . It was only for the private use of the family . They have been buried , I suppose , in the parish church . There you must look for the banners and the achievements . ”
33518	33536	33540	33540	her	143	“ It was foolish of me not to think of all that ; but I am disappointed . ”
33543	33648	33537	33538	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ This chapel was fitted up as you see it , in James the Second ’s time . Before that period , as I understand , the pews were only wainscot ; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth ; but this is not quite certain . It is a handsome chapel , and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening . Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain , within the memory of many ; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off . ”
33649	33656	33658	33659	Miss Crawford	125	“ Every generation has its improvements , ”
33694	33700	33702	33702	Fanny	111	“ It is a pity , ”
33704	33764	33702	33702	Fanny	111	“ that the custom should have been discontinued . It was a valuable part of former times . There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house , with one ’s ideas of what such a household should be ! A whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine ! ”
33765	33770	33772	33773	Miss Crawford	125	“ Very fine indeed , ”
33777	33824	33772	33773	Miss Crawford	125	“ It must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure , and say their prayers here twice a day , while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away . ”
33825	33837	33839	33839	Edmund	105	“ That is hardly Fanny ’s idea of a family assembling , ”
33841	33863	33839	33839	Edmund	105	“ If the master and mistress do not attend themselves , there must be more harm than good in the custom . ”
33864	34068	34073	34073	she	1017	“ At any rate , it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects . Everybody likes to go their own way — to chuse their own time and manner of devotion . The obligation of attendance , the formality , the restraint , the length of time — altogether it is a formidable thing , and what nobody likes ; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed , when they woke with a headache , without danger of reprobation , because chapel was missed , they would have jumped with joy and envy . Can not you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel ? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets — starched up into seeming piety , but with heads full of something very different — especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at — and , in those days , I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now . ”
34102	34213	34098	34098	he	105	“ Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects . You have given us an amusing sketch , and human nature can not say it was not so . We must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish ; but if you are supposing it a frequent thing , that is to say , a weakness grown into a habit from neglect , what could be expected from the private devotions of such persons ? Do you think the minds which are suffered , which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel , would be more collected in a closet ? ”
34214	34251	34359	34359	Julia	110	“ Yes , very likely . They would have two chances at least in their favour . There would be less to distract the attention from without , and it would not be tried so long . ”
34252	34342	34098	34098	he	105	“ The mind which does not struggle against itself under one circumstance , would find objects to distract it in the other , I believe ; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with . The greater length of the service , however , I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind . One wishes it were not so ; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are . ”
34372	34406	34359	34359	Julia	110	“ Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria , standing side by side , exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed . Have not they completely the air of it ? ”
34430	34444	34407	34408	Mr. Crawford	130	“ I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar . ”
34478	34486	34458	34458	herself	696	“ If he would give her away ? ”
34487	34498	34500	34500	his	130	“ I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , ”
34522	34566	34568	34568	she	110	“ Upon my word , it is really a pity that it should not take place directly , if we had but a proper licence , for here we are altogether , and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant . ”
34625	34633	34635	34635	Julia	110	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ”
34649	34685	34641	34641	he	130	“ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly . How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ”
34718	34731	34714	34714	Fanny	111	“ How distressed she will be at what she said just now , ”
34737	34740	34742	34743	Miss Crawford	125	“ Ordained ! ”
34745	34755	34742	34743	Miss Crawford	125	“ what , are you to be a clergyman ? ”
34756	34774	34775	34776	Miss Crawford	125	“ Yes ; I shall take orders soon after my father ’s return — probably at Christmas . ”
34790	34809	34742	34743	Miss Crawford	125	“ If I had known this before , I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect , ”
34918	34922	34924	34924	he	615	“ For if , ”
34944	34982	34983	34984	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ we are too long going over the house , we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors . It is past two , and we are to dine at five . ”
35080	35090	35092	35093	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ Suppose we turn down here for the present , ”
35103	35120	35092	35093	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ Here are the greatest number of our plants , and here are the curious pheasants . ”
35121	35124	35126	35127	Mr. Crawford	130	“ Query , ”
35133	35168	35126	35127	Mr. Crawford	130	“ whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ? I see walls of great promise . Mr. Rushworth , shall we summon a council on this lawn ? ”
35169	35172	35174	35175	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ James , ”
35180	35203	35174	35175	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party . The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet . ”
35597	35603	35605	35606	Miss Crawford	125	“ This is insufferably hot , ”
35636	35695	35605	35606	Miss Crawford	125	“ Shall any of us object to being comfortable ? Here is a nice little wood , if one can but get into it . What happiness if the door should not be locked ! but of course it is ; for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like . ”
35820	35840	35815	35816	Miss Crawford	125	“ So you are to be a clergyman , Mr. Bertram . This is rather a surprise to me . ”
35841	35875	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ Why should it surprise you ? You must suppose me designed for some profession , and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer , nor a soldier , nor a sailor . ”
35876	35912	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ Very true ; but , in short , it had not occurred to me . And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son . ”
35913	35919	35921	35921	Edmund	105	“ A very praiseworthy practice , ”
35923	35946	35921	35921	Edmund	105	“ but not quite universal . I am one of the exceptions , and being one , must do something for myself . ”
35947	35977	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ But why are you to be a clergyman ? I thought that was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . ”
35978	35990	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ Do you think the church itself never chosen , then ? ”
35991	36057	35921	35921	Edmund	105	“ Never is a black word . But yes , in the never of conversation , which means not very often , I do think it . For what is to be done in the church ? Men love to distinguish themselves , and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained , but not in the church . A clergyman is nothing . ”
36058	36200	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ The nothing of conversation has its gradations , I hope , as well as the never . A clergyman can not be high in state or fashion . He must not head mobs , or set the ton in dress . But I can not call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind , individually or collectively considered , temporally and eternally , which has the guardianship of religion and morals , and consequently of the manners which result from their influence . No one here can call the office nothing . If the man who holds it is so , it is by the neglect of his duty , by foregoing its just importance , and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear . ”
36201	36315	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ You assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend . One does not see much of this influence and importance in society , and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves ? How can two sermons a week , even supposing them worth hearing , supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair ’s to his own , do all that you speak of ? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week ? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit . ”
36316	36332	35921	35921	Edmund	105	“ You are speaking of London , I am speaking of the nation at large . ”
36333	36349	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ The metropolis , I imagine , is a pretty fair sample of the rest . ”
36350	36613	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ Not , I should hope , of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom . We do not look in great cities for our best morality . It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good ; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt . A fine preacher is followed and admired ; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood , where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character , and observing his general conduct , which in London can rarely be the case . The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners . They are known to the largest part only as preachers . And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life . The manners I speak of might rather be called conduct , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . ”
36614	36617	36619	36619	Fanny	111	“ Certainly , ”
36625	36628	36630	36631	Miss Crawford	125	“ There , ”
36633	36642	36630	36631	Miss Crawford	125	“ you have quite convinced Miss Price already . ”
36643	36653	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . ”
36654	36663	36665	36665	she	125	“ I do not think you ever will , ”
36672	36719	36665	36665	she	125	“ I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders . You really are fit for something better . Come , do change your mind . It is not too late . Go into the law . ”
36720	36740	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ Go into the law ! With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness . ”
36741	36771	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ”
36772	36835	36665	36665	she	125	“ You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon mot , for there is not the least wit in my nature . I am a very matter - of - fact , plain - spoken being , and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out . ”
36853	36899	36845	36845	Fanny	111	“ I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ”
36900	36905	36907	36907	Edmund	105	“ My dear Fanny , ”
36916	36933	36907	36907	Edmund	105	“ how thoughtless I have been ! I hope you are not very tired . Perhaps , ”
36939	36953	36907	36907	Edmund	105	“ my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . ”
36954	36966	36967	36967	She	1068	“ Thank you , but I am not at all tired . ”
37004	37010	37012	37012	he	105	“ You scarcely touch me , ”
37014	37074	37012	37012	he	105	“ You do not make me of any use . What a difference in the weight of a woman ’s arm from that of a man ! At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . ”
37075	37108	36974	36974	she	1068	“ I am really not tired , which I almost wonder at ; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood . Do not you think we have ? ”
37109	37115	37117	37117	his	105	“ Not half a mile , ”
37143	37199	37122	37122	he	105	“ Oh ! you do not consider how much we have wound about . We have taken such a very serpentine course , and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line , for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path . ”
37200	37251	36974	36974	she	1068	“ But if you remember , before we left that first great path , we saw directly to the end of it . We looked down the whole vista , and saw it closed by iron gates , and it could not have been more than a furlong in length . ”
37252	37310	36974	36974	she	1068	“ Oh ! I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass . ”
37311	37323	37325	37325	Edmund	105	“ We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here , ”
37332	37344	37325	37325	Edmund	105	“ Do you think we are walking four miles an hour ? ”
37345	37376	36974	36974	she	1068	“ Oh ! do not attack me with your watch . A watch is always too fast or too slow . I can not be dictated to by a watch . ”
37431	37442	37444	37444	Edmund	105	“ I am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , ”
37449	37490	37444	37444	Edmund	105	“ why would not you speak sooner ? This will be a bad day ’s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up . Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon , Miss Crawford , except riding . ”
37491	37528	37711	37711	she	125	“ How abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week ! I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ”
37529	37556	37444	37444	Edmund	105	“ Your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect . Fanny ’s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . ”
37557	37658	37444	37444	Edmund	105	“ That she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one ’s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one ’s eyes and one ’s attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for . It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ”
37659	37666	37668	37668	Fanny	111	“ I shall soon be rested , ”
37670	37692	37668	37668	Fanny	111	“ to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ”
37704	37709	37711	37711	she	125	“ I must move , ”
37713	37754	37711	37711	she	125	“ resting fatigues me . I have looked across the ha - ha till I am weary . I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . ”
37761	37795	37755	37755	Edmund	105	“ Now , Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . ”
37796	37803	37805	37805	she	125	“ It is an immense distance , ”
37807	37815	37805	37805	she	125	“ I see that with a glance . ”
38148	38153	38130	38131	Mr. Crawford	130	“ Miss Price all alone ”
38155	38164	38130	38131	Mr. Crawford	130	“ My dear Fanny , how comes this ? ”
38175	38180	38170	38170	She	125	“ Poor dear Fanny , ”
38185	38203	38170	38170	She	125	“ how ill you have been used by them ! You had better have staid with us . ”
38508	38530	38532	38533	Mr. Crawford	130	“ It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , ”
38540	38568	38532	38533	Mr. Crawford	130	“ Yes , there is nothing else to be done . But now , sincerely , do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected ? ”
38569	38606	38752	38753	Miss Bertram	110	“ No , indeed , far otherwise . I find it better , grander , more complete in its style , though that style may not be the best . And to tell you the truth , ”
38611	38641	38752	38753	Miss Bertram	110	“ I do not think that I shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now . Another summer will hardly improve it to me . ”
38651	38686	38647	38648	the lady	696	“ You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world . If other people think Sotherton improved , I have no doubt that you will . ”
38687	38743	38532	38533	Mr. Crawford	130	“ I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points . My feelings are not quite so evanescent , nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world . ”
38757	38789	38752	38753	Miss Bertram	110	“ You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning . I was glad to see you so well entertained . You and Julia were laughing the whole way . ”
38790	38839	38647	38648	the lady	696	“ Were we ? Yes , I believe we were ; but I have not the least recollection at what . Oh ! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle ’s . Your sister loves to laugh . ”
38840	38852	38647	38648	the lady	696	“ You think her more light - hearted than I am ? ”
38853	38858	38859	38859	he	1090	“ More easily amused , ”
38862	38868	38859	38859	he	1090	“ consequently , you know , ”
38871	38893	38859	38859	he	1090	“ better company . I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles ’ drive . ”
38894	38916	38647	38648	the lady	696	“ Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . ”
38917	38959	38647	38648	the lady	696	“ You have , undoubtedly ; and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility . Your prospects , however , are too fair to justify want of spirits . You have a very smiling scene before you . ”
38960	39021	39023	39023	she	1090	“ Do you mean literally or figuratively ? Literally , I conclude . Yes , certainly , the sun shines , and the park looks very cheerful . But unluckily that iron gate , that ha - ha , give me a feeling of restraint and hardship . ‘ I can not get out , ’ as the starling said . ”
39042	39052	39032	39032	she	1090	“ Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key ! ”
39053	39124	38647	38648	the lady	696	“ And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr. Rushworth ’s authority and protection , or I think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate , here , with my assistance ; I think it might be done , if you really wished to be more at large , and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited . ”
39125	39162	39032	39032	she	1090	“ Prohibited ! nonsense ! I certainly can get out that way , and I will . Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment , you know ; we shall not be out of sight . ”
39163	39196	39032	39032	she	1090	“ Or if we are , Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll : the grove of oak on the knoll . ”
39216	39225	39226	39226	she	1091	“ You will hurt yourself , Miss Bertram , ”
39229	39264	39226	39226	she	1091	“ you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes ; you will tear your gown ; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha - ha . You had better not go . ”
39294	39318	39291	39291	she	1091	“ Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ”
39494	39512	39513	39513	Fanny	111	“ Heyday ! Where are the others ? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you . ”
39516	39532	39513	39513	Fanny	111	“ A pretty trick , upon my word ! I can not see them anywhere , ”
39539	39565	39513	39513	Fanny	111	“ But they can not be very far off , and I think I am equal to as much as Maria , even without help . ”
39566	39589	39513	39513	Fanny	111	“ But , Julia , Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key . Do wait for Mr. Rushworth . ”
39590	39670	39513	39513	Fanny	111	“ Not I , indeed . I have had enough of the family for one morning . Why , child , I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother . Such a penance as I have been enduring , while you were sitting here so composed and so happy ! It might have been as well , perhaps , if you had been in my place , but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes . ”
39727	39765	39701	39701	she	110	“ Yes , yes , we saw him . He was posting away as if upon life and death , and could but just spare time to tell us his errand , and where you all were . ”
39766	39780	39701	39701	she	110	“ It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing . ”
39781	39829	39831	39831	she	110	“ That is Miss Maria ’s concern . I am not obliged to punish myself for her sins . The mother I could not avoid , as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper , but the son I can get away from . ”
39982	40008	40022	40022	he	111	“ They desired me to stay — my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll , or thereabouts . ”
40009	40020	40022	40022	he	111	“ I do not believe I shall go any farther , ”
40025	40053	40022	40022	he	111	“ I see nothing of them . By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else . I have had walking enough . ”
40066	40072	40074	40074	she	1099	“ I am very sorry , ”
40076	40082	40074	40074	she	1099	“ it is very unlucky . ”
40103	40115	40117	40117	he	111	“ I think they might as well have staid for me , ”
40119	40128	40117	40117	he	111	“ Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . ”
40129	40143	40159	40159	he	111	“ I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . ”
40161	40192	40159	40159	he	111	on—“Pray , Miss Price , are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are ? For my part , I can see nothing in him . ”
40193	40203	40117	40117	he	111	“ I do not think him at all handsome . ”
40204	40266	40159	40159	he	111	“ Handsome ! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome . He is not five foot nine . I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . I think he is an ill - looking fellow . In my opinion , these Crawfords are no addition at all . We did very well without them . ”
40284	40315	40275	40275	she	1100	“ If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key , there might have been some excuse , but I went the very moment she said she wanted it . ”
40316	40385	40386	40386	He	1101	“ Nothing could be more obliging than your manner , I am sure , and I dare say you walked as fast as you could ; but still it is some distance , you know , from this spot to the house , quite into the house ; and when people are waiting , they are bad judges of time , and every half minute seems like five . ”
40397	40410	40386	40386	He	1101	“ wished he had had the key about him at the time . ”
40437	40490	40432	40432	she	1100	“ It is a pity you should not join them . They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park , and will be thinking how it may be improved ; and nothing of that sort , you know , can be settled without you . ”
40511	40514	40516	40516	he	111	“ Well , ”
40518	40539	40516	40516	he	111	“ if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . ”
41349	41374	41341	41342	Mr. Crawford	130	“ I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ”
41477	41495	41497	41498	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ”
41507	41549	41497	41498	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end ! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . A pretty good day ’s amusement you have had ! ”
41559	41596	41550	41550	Maria	97	“ I think you have done pretty well yourself , ma’am . Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ”
41597	41784	41497	41498	Mrs. Norris	102	“ My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly . There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner . Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses . I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with . That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure ! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns . Take care of the cheese , Fanny . Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well . ”
41785	41793	41795	41795	Maria	97	“ What else have you been spunging ? ”
41807	41943	41795	41795	Maria	97	“ Spunging , my dear ! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants ’ eggs , which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me : she would not take a denial . She said it must be such an amusement to me , as she understood I lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort ; and so to be sure it will . I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them . And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some . ”
42487	42500	42473	42473	she	125	“ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks ! He is thinking of November . ”
42515	42527	42505	42506	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ Your father ’s return will be a very interesting event . ”
42528	42551	42473	42473	she	125	“ It will , indeed , after such an absence ; an absence not only long , but including so many dangers . ”
42552	42574	42473	42473	she	125	“ It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister ’s marriage , and your taking orders . ”
42575	42578	42505	42506	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ Yes . ”
42579	42585	42587	42587	she	125	“ Do n’t be affronted , ”
42591	42628	42587	42587	she	125	“ but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . ”
42629	42638	42640	42640	Edmund	105	“ There is no sacrifice in the case , ”
42654	42662	42640	42640	Edmund	105	“ it is entirely her own doing . ”
42663	42712	42473	42473	she	125	“ Oh yes I know it is . I was merely joking . She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy . My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . ”
42713	42731	42473	42473	she	125	“ My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria ’s marrying . ”
42732	42764	42640	42640	Edmund	105	“ It is fortunate that your inclination and your father ’s convenience should accord so well . There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . ”
42765	42773	42473	42473	she	125	“ Which you suppose has biassed me ? ”
42774	42784	42786	42786	Fanny	111	“ But that I am sure it has not , ”
42788	42921	42786	42786	Fanny	111	“ Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me . Nor can I think it wrong that it should . There was no natural disinclination to be overcome , and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life . I was in safe hands . I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it . I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly . ”
42922	42931	42933	42933	Fanny	111	“ It is the same sort of thing , ”
42940	43004	42933	42933	Fanny	111	“ as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . ”
43005	43065	42473	42473	she	125	“ No , my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good . The profession , either navy or army , is its own justification . It has everything in its favour : heroism , danger , bustle , fashion . Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society . Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors . ”
43066	43089	43091	43091	Edmund	105	“ But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? ”
43093	43114	43091	43091	Edmund	105	“ To be justified in your eyes , he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision . ”
43115	43134	42473	42473	she	125	“ What ! take orders without a living ! No ; that is madness indeed ; absolute madness . ”
43135	43252	42473	42473	she	125	“ Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ? No ; for you certainly would not know what to say . But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument . As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . ”
43253	43388	43091	43091	Edmund	105	“ Oh ! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made , to the trouble of working for one ; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat , drink , and grow fat . It is indolence , Mr. Bertram , indeed . Indolence and love of ease ; a want of all laudable ambition , of taste for good company , or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable , which make men clergymen . A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish — read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . ”
43389	43506	42473	42473	she	125	“ There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character . I suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing . It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy . You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively . You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle ’s table . ”
43507	43556	42473	42473	she	125	“ I speak what appears to me the general opinion ; and where an opinion is general , it is usually correct . Though I have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen , it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information . ”
43557	43618	43091	43091	Edmund	105	“ Where any one body of educated men , of whatever denomination , are condemned indiscriminately , there must be a deficiency of information , or ( smiling ) of something else . Your uncle , and his brother admirals , perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom , good or bad , they were always wishing away . ”
43619	43636	42473	42473	she	125	“ Poor William ! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp , ”
43660	43675	43677	43678	Miss Crawford	125	“ I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ”
43680	43869	43677	43678	Miss Crawford	125	“ that I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , I see him to be an indolent , selfish bon vivant , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife . To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . ”
43870	43937	42473	42473	she	125	“ I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word . It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours . Fanny , it goes against us . We can not attempt to defend Dr. Grant . ”
43938	43941	43943	43943	Fanny	111	“ No , ”
43945	44190	43943	43943	Fanny	111	“ but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman . Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the frequency , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now . A man — a sensible man like Dr. Grant , can not be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week , can not go to church twice every Sunday , and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does , without being the better for it himself . It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . ”
44191	44264	42473	42473	she	125	“ We can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . ”
44265	44277	44279	44279	Edmund	105	“ I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , ”
44282	44292	44279	44279	Edmund	105	“ must be beyond the reach of any sermons . ”
44314	44330	44301	44302	Miss Crawford	125	“ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ”
44382	44393	44395	44395	he	105	“ There goes good - humour , I am sure , ”
44398	44438	44439	44439	he	105	“ There goes a temper which would never give pain ! How well she walks ! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others ! joining them the moment she is asked . What a pity , ”
44448	44458	44439	44439	he	105	“ that she should have been in such hands ! ”
44538	44543	44545	44545	she	125	“ Here ’s harmony ! ”
44547	44646	44545	44545	she	125	“ here ’s repose ! Here ’s what may leave all painting and all music behind , and what poetry only can attempt to describe ! Here ’s what may tranquillise every care , and lift the heart to rapture ! When I look out on such a night as this , I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world ; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to , and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene . ”
44647	44709	44533	44533	Fanny	111	“ I like to hear your enthusiasm , Fanny . It is a lovely night , and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel , in some degree , as you do ; who have not , at least , been given a taste for Nature in early life . They lose a great deal . ”
44710	44724	44866	44867	the singers	1148	“ You taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . ”
44725	44740	44545	44545	she	125	“ I had a very apt scholar . There ’s Arcturus looking very bright . ”
44741	44755	44533	44533	Fanny	111	“ Yes , and the Bear . I wish I could see Cassiopeia . ”
44756	44772	44533	44533	Fanny	111	“ We must go out on the lawn for that . Should you be afraid ? ”
44773	44793	44866	44867	the singers	1148	“ Not in the least . It is a great while since we have had any star - gazing . ”
44794	44806	44533	44533	Fanny	111	“ Yes ; I do not know how it has happened . ”
44811	44822	44824	44824	he	1146	“ We will stay till this is finished , Fanny , ”
45656	45662	45664	45664	she	1164	“ I am rather surprised , ”
45666	45732	45664	45664	she	1164	“ that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon , after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about , that I thought something would certainly occur , when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere . He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield . ”
45733	45740	45742	45742	Edmund	105	“ It is to his credit , ”
45746	45765	45742	45742	Edmund	105	“ and I dare say it gives his sister pleasure . She does not like his unsettled habits . ”
45766	45776	45664	45664	she	1164	“ What a favourite he is with my cousins ! ”
45777	45833	45742	45742	Edmund	105	“ Yes , his manners to women are such as must please . Mrs. Grant , I believe , suspects him of a preference for Julia ; I have never seen much symptom of it , but I wish it may be so . He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove . ”
45834	45842	45844	45844	Fanny	111	“ If Miss Bertram were not engaged , ”
45847	45861	45844	45844	Fanny	111	“ I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia . ”
45862	45970	45742	45742	Edmund	105	“ Which is , perhaps , more in favour of his liking Julia best , than you , Fanny , may be aware ; for I believe it often happens that a man , before he has quite made up his own mind , will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself . Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . ”
46282	46288	46290	46291	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I think , ma’am , ”
46310	46320	46293	46293	her	102	“ we shall see some happy faces again now . ”
46321	46328	46330	46331	the other	460	“ Yes , ma’am , indeed , ”
46338	46388	46330	46331	the other	460	“ there will be some satisfaction in looking on now , and I think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part . Young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the common forms . I wonder my son did not propose it . ”
46389	46460	46461	46462	Miss Bertram	110	“ I dare say he did , ma’am . Mr. Rushworth is never remiss . But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety , so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays , Mrs. Rushworth — that wish of avoiding particularity ! Dear ma’am , only look at her face at this moment ; how different from what it was the two last dances ! ”
46536	46604	46532	46533	Mrs. Norris	102	“ It is quite delightful , ma’am , to see young people so properly happy , so well suited , and so much the thing ! I can not but think of dear Sir Thomas ’s delight . And what do you say , ma’am , to the chance of another match ? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example , and such things are very catching . ”
46621	46635	46605	46606	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ The couple above , ma’am . Do you see no symptoms there ? ”
46636	46660	46532	46533	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Oh dear ! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford . Yes , indeed , a very pretty match . What is his property ? ”
46661	46667	46532	46533	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Four thousand a year . ”
46668	46715	46605	46606	Mrs. Rushworth	143	“ Very well . Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have . Four thousand a year is a pretty estate , and he seems a very genteel , steady young man , so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy . ”
46716	46755	46756	46756	Fanny	111	“ It is not a settled thing , ma’am , yet . We only speak of it among friends . But I have very little doubt it will be . He is growing extremely particular in his attentions . ”
46905	46921	46886	46886	he	105	“ If you want to dance , Fanny , I will stand up with you . ”
46939	46946	46948	46948	he	105	“ I am glad of it , ”
46963	47065	46948	46948	he	105	“ for I am tired to death . I only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long . They had need be all in love , to find any amusement in such folly ; and so they are , I fancy . If you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers — all but Yates and Mrs. Grant — and , between ourselves , she , poor woman , must want a lover as much as any one of them . A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor , ”
47117	47149	47071	47071	he	1191	“ A strange business this in America , Dr. Grant ! What is your opinion ? I always come to you to know what I am to think of public matters . ”
47150	47155	47157	47158	his aunt	608	“ My dear Tom , ”
47162	47187	47157	47158	his aunt	608	“ as you are not dancing , I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber ; shall you ? ”
47207	47279	47157	47158	his aunt	608	“ We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth , you know . Your mother is quite anxious about it , but can not very well spare time to sit down herself , because of her fringe . Now , you and I and Dr. Grant will just do ; and though we play but half - crowns , you know , you may bet half - guineas with him . ”
47280	47287	47289	47289	he	1191	“ I should be most happy , ”
47298	47321	47289	47289	he	1191	“ it would give me the greatest pleasure ; but that I am this moment going to dance . Come , Fanny , ”
47326	47341	47289	47289	he	1191	“ do not be dawdling any longer , or the dance will be over . ”
47381	47390	47391	47391	he	1191	“ A pretty modest request upon my word , ”
47399	47580	47391	47391	he	1191	“ To want to nail me to a card - table for the next two hours with herself and Dr. Grant , who are always quarrelling , and that poking old woman , who knows no more of whist than of algebra . I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy ! And to ask me in such a way too ! without ceremony , before them all , so as to leave me no possibility of refusing . That is what I dislike most particularly . It raises my spleen more than anything , to have the pretence of being asked , of being given a choice , and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing , whatever it be ! If I had not luckily thought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it . It is a great deal too bad . But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head , nothing can stop her . ”
48005	48010	48012	48012	he	174	“ A trifling part , ”
48014	48224	48012	48012	he	174	“ and not at all to my taste , and such a one as I certainly would not accept again ; but I was determined to make no difficulties . Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford ; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me , it was impossible to take it , you know . I was sorry for him that he should have so mistaken his powers , for he was no more equal to the Baron — a little man with a weak voice , always hoarse after the first ten minutes . It must have injured the piece materially ; but I was resolved to make no difficulties . Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick , but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself ; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two . I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick . Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him . Our Agatha was inimitable , and the duke was thought very great by many . And upon the whole , it would certainly have gone off wonderfully . ”
48225	48235	47991	47991	Lovers	177	“ It was a hard case , upon my word ”
48239	48251	48012	48012	he	174	“ I do think you were very much to be pitied , ”
48260	48368	48012	48012	he	174	“ It is not worth complaining about ; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time ; and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted . It was but three days ; and being only a grandmother , and all happening two hundred miles off , I think there would have been no great harm , and it was suggested , I know ; but Lord Ravenshaw , who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England , would not hear of it . ”
48369	48377	48379	48380	Mr. Bertram	105	“ An afterpiece instead of a comedy , ”
48382	48466	48379	48380	Mr. Bertram	105	“ Lovers ’ Vows were at an end , and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves . Well , the jointure may comfort him ; and perhaps , between friends , he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron , and was not sorry to withdraw ; and to make you amends , Yates , I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield , and ask you to be our manager . ”
48554	48567	48568	48569	Each sister	318	“ Oh for the Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with . ”
48603	48608	48610	48610	he	128	“ I really believe , ”
48612	48718	48610	48610	he	128	“ I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written , from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat . I feel as if I could be anything or everything ; as if I could rant and storm , or sigh or cut capers , in any tragedy or comedy in the English language . Let us be doing something . Be it only half a play , an act , a scene ; what should prevent us ? Not these countenances , I am sure , ”
48725	48751	48610	48610	he	128	“ and for a theatre , what signifies a theatre ? We shall be only amusing ourselves . Any room in this house might suffice . ”
48752	48759	48761	48762	Tom Bertram	98	“ We must have a curtain , ”
48764	48782	48761	48762	Tom Bertram	98	“ a few yards of green baize for a curtain , and perhaps that may be enough . ”
48783	48789	48791	48792	Mr. Yates	174	“ Oh , quite enough , ”
48794	48843	48791	48792	Mr. Yates	174	“ with only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this . For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more . ”
48844	48854	48856	48856	Maria	97	“ I believe we must be satisfied with less , ”
48858	48903	48856	48856	Maria	97	“ There would not be time , and other difficulties would arise . We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford ’s views , and make the performance , not the theatre , our object . Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery . ”
48904	48907	48909	48909	Edmund	105	“ Nay , ”
48918	49009	48909	48909	Edmund	105	“ Let us do nothing by halves . If we are to act , let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit , boxes , and gallery , and let us have a play entire from beginning to end ; so as it be a German play , no matter what , with a good tricking , shifting afterpiece , and a figure - dance , and a hornpipe , and a song between the acts . If we do not outdo Ecclesford , we do nothing . ”
49010	49020	49022	49022	Julia	110	“ Now , Edmund , do not be disagreeable , ”
49024	49044	49022	49022	Julia	110	“ Nobody loves a play better than you do , or can have gone much farther to see one . ”
49045	49106	48856	48856	Maria	97	“ True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ”
49310	49459	49298	49298	Fanny	111	entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground . I can stand it no longer , and I think , I may say , that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again ; but one good thing I have just ascertained : it is the very room for a theatre , precisely the shape and length for it ; and the doors at the farther end , communicating with each other , as they may be made to do in five minutes , by merely moving the bookcase in my father ’s room , is the very thing we could have desired , if we had sat down to wish for it ; and my father ’s room will be an excellent greenroom . It seems to join the billiard - room on purpose . ”
49460	49473	49475	49475	Edmund	105	“ You are not serious , Tom , in meaning to act ? ”
49489	49510	49475	49475	Edmund	105	“ Not serious ! never more so , I assure you . What is there to surprise you in it ? ”
49511	49613	49298	49298	Fanny	111	“ I think it would be very wrong . In a general light , private theatricals are open to some objections , but as we are circumstanced , I must think it would be highly injudicious , and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind . It would shew great want of feeling on my father ’s account , absent as he is , and in some degree of constant danger ; and it would be imprudent , I think , with regard to Maria , whose situation is a very delicate one , considering everything , extremely delicate . ”
49614	49840	49842	49842	he	1228	“ You take up a thing so seriously ! as if we were going to act three times a week till my father ’s return , and invite all the country . But it is not to be a display of that sort . We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves , just to vary the scene , and exercise our powers in something new . We want no audience , no publicity . We may be trusted , I think , in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable ; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own . I have no fears and no scruples . And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he . It is a very anxious period for her . ”
49905	49914	49916	49916	Tom	98	“ By Jove ! this wo n’t do , ”
49928	49945	49916	49916	Tom	98	“ To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety — I was unlucky there . ”
49946	49952	49954	49955	her ladyship	902	“ What is the matter ? ”
49967	49973	49954	49955	her ladyship	902	“ I was not asleep . ”
49974	49990	49991	49991	he	105	“ Oh dear , no , ma’am , nobody suspected you ! Well , Edmund , ”
50015	50030	50008	50009	Lady Bertram	103	“ but this I will maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . ”
50031	50050	49954	49955	her ladyship	902	“ I can not agree with you ; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it . ”
50051	50165	50008	50009	Lady Bertram	103	“ And I am convinced to the contrary . Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people , or promotes it more , than my father , and for anything of the acting , spouting , reciting kind , I think he has always a decided taste . I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys . How many a time have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar , and to be’d and not to be’d , in this very room , for his amusement ? And I am sure , my name was Norval , every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays . ”
50166	50215	50008	50009	Lady Bertram	103	“ It was a very different thing . You must see the difference yourself . My father wished us , as schoolboys , to speak well , but he would never wish his grown - up daughters to be acting plays . His sense of decorum is strict . ”
50216	50222	50224	50224	Tom	98	“ I know all that , ”
50228	50272	50224	50224	Tom	98	“ I know my father as well as you do ; and I ’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him . Manage your own concerns , Edmund , and I ’ll take care of the rest of the family . ”
50273	50281	50283	50285	the persevering Edmund	1232	“ If you are resolved on acting , ”
50287	50332	50283	50285	the persevering Edmund	1232	“ I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way ; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted . It would be taking liberties with my father ’s house in his absence which could not be justified . ”
50333	50344	50346	50346	Tom	98	“ For everything of that nature I will be answerable , ”
50353	50477	50346	50346	Tom	98	“ His house shall not be hurt . I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other . Absolute nonsense ! ”
50478	50496	50283	50285	the persevering Edmund	1232	“ The innovation , if not wrong as an innovation , will be wrong as an expense . ”
50497	50631	50346	50346	Tom	98	“ Yes , the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious ! Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds . Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly , but it will be on the simplest plan : a green curtain and a little carpenter ’s work , and that ’s all ; and as the carpenter ’s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself , it will be too absurd to talk of expense ; and as long as Jackson is employed , everything will be right with Sir Thomas . Do n’t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself . Do n’t act yourself , if you do not like it , but do n’t expect to govern everybody else . ”
50632	50640	50642	50642	Edmund	105	“ No , as to acting myself , ”
50644	50651	50642	50642	Edmund	105	“ that I absolutely protest against . ”
50710	50737	50703	50703	her	1234	“ Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them . Your brother ’s taste and your sisters ’ seem very different . ”
50738	50779	50703	50703	her	1234	“ I have no hope there , Fanny . If they persist in the scheme , they will find something . I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them , and that is all I can do . ”
50780	50793	50703	50703	her	1234	“ I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . ”
50794	50864	50865	50865	His	1235	“ I dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her . Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all , and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears . ”
51082	51139	51068	51069	Henry Crawford	128	“ No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram . No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves . ”
51149	51166	51142	51142	Edmund	105	“ What say you now ? Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same ? ”
51780	51906	51907	51907	Fanny	111	“ Oh no , that will never do ! Let us have no ranting tragedies . Too many characters . Not a tolerable woman ’s part in the play . Anything but that , my dear Tom . It would be impossible to fill it up . One could not expect anybody to take such a part . Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end . That might do , perhaps , but for the low parts . If I must give my opinion , I have always thought it the most insipid play in the English language . I do not wish to make objections ; I shall be happy to be of any use , but I think we could not chuse worse . ”
51972	51978	51980	51981	Tom Bertram	98	“ This will never do , ”
51985	52089	51980	51981	Tom Bertram	98	“ We are wasting time most abominably . Something must be fixed on . No matter what , so that something is chosen . We must not be so nice . A few characters too many must not frighten us . We must double them . We must descend a little . If a part is insignificant , the greater our credit in making anything of it . From this moment I make no difficulties . I take any part you chuse to give me , so as it be comic . Let it but be comic , I condition for nothing more . ”
52181	52307	52154	52156	the same speaker	1271	exclaimed—“Lovers ’ Vows ! And why should not Lovers ’ Vows do for us as well as for the Ravenshaws ? How came it never to be thought of before ? It strikes me as if it would do exactly . What say you all ? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates and Crawford , and here is the rhyming Butler for me , if nobody else wants it ; a trifling part , but the sort of thing I should not dislike , and , as I said before , I am determined to take anything and do my best . And as for the rest , they may be filled up by anybody . It is only Count Cassel and Anhalt . ”
52619	52629	52631	52631	she	110	“ This is not behaving well by the absent , ”
52633	52661	52631	52631	she	110	“ Here are not women enough . Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me , but here is nothing for your sister , Mr. Crawford . ”
52737	52748	52750	52750	he	98	“ It falls as naturally , as necessarily to her , ”
52752	52779	52750	52750	he	98	“ as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters . It can be no sacrifice on their side , for it is highly comic . ”
52839	52847	52849	52849	he	98	“ I must entreat Miss Julia Bertram , ”
52851	52880	52849	52849	he	98	“ not to engage in the part of Agatha , or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity . You must not , indeed you must not ”
52887	52926	52849	52849	he	98	“ I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness . The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me , and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away . ”
53016	53147	53007	53007	his	435	“ Oh yes ! Maria must be Agatha . Maria will be the best Agatha . Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy , I would not trust her in it . There is nothing of tragedy about her . She has not the look of it . Her features are not tragic features , and she walks too quick , and speaks too quick , and would not keep her countenance . She had better do the old countrywoman : the Cottager ’s wife ; you had , indeed , Julia . Cottager ’s wife is a very pretty part , I assure you . The old lady relieves the high - flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit . You shall be Cottager ’s wife . ”
53148	53153	53155	53156	Mr. Yates	174	“ Cottager ’s wife ! ”
53158	53255	53007	53007	his	435	“ What are you talking of ? The most trivial , paltry , insignificant part ; the merest commonplace ; not a tolerable speech in the whole . Your sister do that ! It is an insult to propose it . At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it . We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else . A little more justice , Mr. Manager , if you please . You do not deserve the office , if you can not appreciate the talents of your company a little better . ”
53256	53417	53007	53007	his	435	“ Why , as to that , my good friend , till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork ; but I mean no disparagement to Julia . We can not have two Agathas , and we must have one Cottager ’s wife ; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler . If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it ; and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous , let her take Cottager ’s speeches instead of Cottager ’s wife ’s , and so change the parts all through ; he is solemn and pathetic enough , I am sure . It could make no difference in the play , and as for Cottager himself , when he has got his wife ’s speeches , I would undertake him with all my heart . ”
53418	53428	53430	53431	Henry Crawford	128	“ With all your partiality for Cottager ’s wife , ”
53433	53587	53430	53431	Henry Crawford	128	“ it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister , and we must not suffer her good - nature to be imposed on . We must not allow her to accept the part . She must not be left to her own complaisance . Her talents will be wanted in Amelia . Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha . I consider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece . It requires great powers , great nicety , to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance . I have seen good actresses fail in the part . Simplicity , indeed , is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession . It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not . It requires a gentlewoman — a Julia Bertram . You will undertake it , I hope ? ”
53623	53702	53617	53618	Miss Crawford	125	“ No , no , Julia must not be Amelia . It is not at all the part for her . She would not like it . She would not do well . She is too tall and robust . Amelia should be a small , light , girlish , skipping figure . It is fit for Miss Crawford , and Miss Crawford only . She looks the part , and I am persuaded will do it admirably . ”
53714	53720	53722	53722	he	128	“ You must oblige us , ”
53724	53797	53722	53722	he	128	“ indeed you must . When you have studied the character , I am sure you will feel it suit you . Tragedy may be your choice , but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you . You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions ; you will not refuse to visit me in prison ? I think I see you coming in with your basket . ”
53915	53956	53910	53910	she	110	“ You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions — though one might have supposed — but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering ! ”
53982	53996	53977	53978	Tom Bertram	98	“ Miss Crawford must be Amelia . She will be an excellent Amelia . ”
53997	54008	54010	54010	Julia	110	“ Do not be afraid of my wanting the character , ”
54016	54086	54010	54010	Julia	110	“ I am not to be Agatha , and I am sure I will do nothing else ; and as to Amelia , it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me . I quite detest her . An odious , little , pert , unnatural , impudent girl . I have always protested against comedy , and this is comedy in its worst form . ”
54207	54242	54203	54203	she	110	“ I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded she would do it worse , ”
54792	54799	54801	54801	he	111	“ We have got a play , ”
54803	54864	54801	54801	he	111	“ It is to be Lovers ’ Vows ; and I am to be Count Cassel , and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak , and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit , by way of a shooting - dress . I do not know how I shall like it . ”
54896	54901	54911	54911	his	105	“ Lovers ’ Vows ! ”
54933	54936	54938	54939	Mr. Yates	174	“ Yes , ”
54941	55022	54938	54939	Mr. Yates	174	“ After all our debatings and difficulties , we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well , nothing so unexceptionable , as Lovers ’ Vows . The wonder is that it should not have been thought of before . My stupidity was abominable , for here we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford ; and it is so useful to have anything of a model ! We have cast almost every part . ”
55023	55032	55034	55034	Edmund	105	“ But what do you do for women ? ”
55052	55066	55049	55049	she	97	“ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ”
55073	55081	55049	55049	she	97	“ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ”
55082	55103	55105	55105	Edmund	105	“ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with us , ”
55140	55192	55133	55134	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ I come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches . That ’s something , is not it ? But I do not much like the idea of being so fine . I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . ”
55243	55355	55234	55234	Edmund	105	“ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell you , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . I can not but suppose you will when you have read it carefully over . Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it . It will not be necessary to send you to your father ’s judgment , I am convinced . ”
55356	55363	55365	55365	Maria	97	“ We see things very differently , ”
55367	55426	55365	55365	Maria	97	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and I am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ”
55427	55434	55436	55436	his	1318	“ I am sorry for it , ”
55439	55497	55436	55436	his	1318	“ but in this matter it is you who are to lead . You must set the example . If others have blundered , it is your place to put them right , and shew them what true delicacy is . In all points of decorum your conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ”
55527	55584	55524	55524	she	97	“ I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind . There would be the greatest indecorum , I think . ”
55585	55678	55436	55436	his	1318	“ Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head ? No ; let your conduct be the only harangue . Say that , on examining the part , you feel yourself unequal to it ; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have . Say this with firmness , and it will be quite enough . All who can distinguish will understand your motive . The play will be given up , and your delicacy honoured as it ought . ”
55679	55689	55691	55692	Lady Bertram	103	“ Do not act anything improper , my dear , ”
55694	55721	55691	55692	Lady Bertram	103	“ Sir Thomas would not like it.—Fanny , ring the bell ; I must have my dinner.—To be sure , Julia is dressed by this time . ”
55722	55729	55731	55731	Edmund	105	“ I am convinced , madam , ”
55736	55745	55731	55731	Edmund	105	“ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ”
55746	55759	55691	55692	Lady Bertram	103	“ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ”
55760	55769	55771	55771	Maria	97	“ If I were to decline the part , ”
55777	55784	55771	55771	Maria	97	“ Julia would certainly take it . ”
55785	55788	55790	55790	Edmund	105	“ What ! ”
55792	55799	55790	55790	Edmund	105	“ if she knew your reasons ! ”
55800	55884	55691	55692	Lady Bertram	103	“ Oh ! she might think the difference between us — the difference in our situations — that she need not be so scrupulous as I might feel necessary . I am sure she would argue so . No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ”
55885	55897	55899	55900	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I was just going to say the very same thing , ”
55902	56392	55899	55900	Mrs. Norris	102	“ If every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure that would be a discredit to us all . I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out . We must not be over - precise , Edmund . As Mr. Rushworth is to act too , there can be no harm . I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors . The curtain will be a good job , however . The maids do their work very well , and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings . There is no occasion to put them so very close together . I am of some use , I hope , in preventing waste and making the most of things . There should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones . I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day . I had been looking about me in the poultry - yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants ’ hall - door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them . I knew what all this meant , for the servants ’ dinner - bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads ; and as I hate such encroaching people ( the Jacksons are very encroaching , I have always said so : just the sort of people to get all they can ) , I said to the boy directly ( a great lubberly fellow of ten years old , you know , who ought to be ashamed of himself ) , ‘ I ’ll take the boards to your father , Dick , so get you home again as fast as you can . ’ The boy looked very silly , and turned away without offering a word , for I believe I might speak pretty sharp ; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while . I hate such greediness — so good as your father is to the family , employing the man all the year round ! ”
56663	56672	56633	56633	Mr.	1327	“ Well , how do you go on ? ”
56674	56680	56633	56633	Mr.	1327	“ What have you settled ? ”
56682	56692	56633	56633	Mr.	1327	“ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ”
56730	56738	56740	56740	she	103	“ I must really congratulate your ladyship , ”
56742	56817	56740	56740	she	103	“ on the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties . The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ”
56902	56955	56899	56899	she	125	“ My good friends , you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses , inside and out ; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile . Who is to be Anhalt ? What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to ? ”
56984	57001	56965	56965	many	4302	“ Mr. Rushworth was to be Count Cassel , but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt . ”
57002	57011	57013	57014	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ I had my choice of the parts , ”
57016	57040	57013	57014	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ but I thought I should like the Count best , though I do not much relish the finery I am to have . ”
57041	57051	57053	57054	Miss Crawford	125	“ You chose very wisely , I am sure , ”
57061	57068	57053	57054	Miss Crawford	125	“ Anhalt is a heavy part . ”
57069	57080	57082	57083	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ The Count has two - and - forty speeches , ”
57085	57091	57082	57083	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ which is no trifle . ”
57092	57100	57102	57103	Miss Crawford	125	“ I am not at all surprised , ”
57110	57134	57102	57103	Miss Crawford	125	“ at this want of an Anhalt . Amelia deserves no better . Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ”
57135	57152	57154	57154	Tom	98	“ I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ”
57156	57194	57154	57154	Tom	98	“ but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together . I will not entirely give it up , however ; I will try what can be done — I will look it over again . ”
57195	57203	57205	57206	Mr. Yates	174	“ Your brother should take the part , ”
57213	57221	57205	57206	Mr. Yates	174	“ Do not you think he would ? ”
57222	57229	57231	57231	Tom	98	“ I shall not ask him , ”
57257	57266	57268	57268	she	125	“ They do not want me at all , ”
57273	57339	57268	57268	she	125	“ I only puzzle them , and oblige them to make civil speeches . Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to you . What shall we do for an Anhalt ? Is it practicable for any of the others to double it ? What is your advice ? ”
57340	57344	57346	57346	he	1335	“ My advice , ”
57349	57357	57346	57346	he	1335	“ is that you change the play . ”
57358	57365	57366	57366	she	125	“ I should have no objection , ”
57369	57415	57366	57366	she	125	“ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table ”
57421	57429	57366	57366	she	125	“ it certainly will not be taken . ”
57435	57452	57454	57456	the lady archly	1336	“ If any part could tempt you to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , ”
57463	57473	57454	57456	the lady archly	1336	“ for he is a clergyman , you know . ”
57474	57484	57485	57485	he	1335	“ That circumstance would by no means tempt me , ”
57488	57545	57485	57485	he	1335	“ for I should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting . It must be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal , solemn lecturer ; and the man who chuses the profession itself is , perhaps , one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage . ”
57584	57587	57589	57590	Tom Bertram	98	“ Fanny , ”
57610	57616	57589	57590	Tom Bertram	98	“ we want your services . ”
57651	57689	57647	57647	Edmund	105	“ Oh ! we do not want to disturb you from your seat . We do not want your present services . We shall only want you in our play . You must be Cottager ’s wife . ”
57690	57693	57695	57695	Fanny	111	“ Me ! ”
57706	57736	57695	57695	Fanny	111	“ Indeed you must excuse me . I could not act anything if you were to give me the world . No , indeed , I can not act . ”
57737	57812	57647	57647	Edmund	105	“ Indeed , but you must , for we can not excuse you . It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ”
57813	57824	57826	57827	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ”
57829	57849	57826	57827	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ what would you do with such a part as mine ? I have forty - two to learn . ”
57850	57863	57865	57865	Fanny	111	“ It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , ”
57892	57900	57865	57865	Fanny	111	“ but I really can not act . ”
57901	57964	57647	57647	Edmund	105	“ Yes , yes , you can act well enough for us . Learn your part , and we will teach you all the rest . You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it . ”
57965	58006	57826	57827	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ No , indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me . You can not have an idea . It would be absolutely impossible for me . If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . ”
58007	58090	57647	57647	Edmund	105	“ Phoo ! Phoo ! Do not be so shamefaced . You ’ll do it very well . Every allowance will be made for you . We do not expect perfection . You must get a brown gown , and a white apron , and a mob cap , and we must make you a few wrinkles , and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes , and you will be a very proper , little old woman . ”
58091	58103	58105	58105	Fanny	111	“ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ”
58235	58299	58219	58220	Mrs. Norris	102	audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you ! Take the part with a good grace , and let us hear no more of the matter , I entreat . ”
58300	58308	58310	58310	Edmund	105	“ Do not urge her , madam , ”
58312	58363	58219	58220	Mrs. Norris	102	“ It is not fair to urge her in this manner . You see she does not like to act . Let her chuse for herself , as well as the rest of us . Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted . Do not urge her any more . ”
58364	58373	58375	58376	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I am not going to urge her , ”
58379	58417	58375	58376	Mrs. Norris	102	“ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . ”
58460	58476	58443	58443	Fanny	111	“ I do not like my situation : this place is too hot for me , ”
58510	58538	58506	58506	she	125	“ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ”
58830	58843	58844	58844	he	98	“ But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it , ”
58847	58964	58844	58844	he	98	“ We have but to speak the word ; we may pick and chuse . I could name , at this moment , at least six young men within six miles of us , who are wild to be admitted into our company , and there are one or two that would not disgrace us : I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox . Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow , and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere , so I will take my horse early to - morrow morning and ride over to Stoke , and settle with one of them . ”
59016	59101	59011	59012	Miss Crawford	125	“ As far as I am concerned , I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible . Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen ? Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister ’s one day , did not he , Henry ? A quiet - looking young man . I remember him . Let him be applied to , if you please , for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger . ”
59155	59166	59167	59167	Edmund	105	“ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ”
59183	59194	59196	59197	Miss Crawford	125	“ I am not very sanguine as to our play , ”
59209	59252	59196	59197	Miss Crawford	125	“ and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of his speeches , and a great many of my own , before we rehearse together . It will be very disagreeable , and by no means what I expected . ”
60651	60654	60649	60649	her	1392	“ Come in ”
60684	60698	60700	60700	he	105	“ Can I speak with you , Fanny , for a few minutes ? ”
60702	60707	60700	60700	he	105	“ Yes , certainly . ”
60708	60719	60675	60675	Her	1392	“ I want to consult . I want your opinion . ”
60720	60724	60725	60725	she	1392	“ My opinion ! ”
60740	60898	60725	60725	she	1392	“ Yes , your advice and opinion . I do not know what to do . This acting scheme gets worse and worse , you see . They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could , and now , to complete the business , are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us . This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first . I know no harm of Charles Maddox ; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable , the more than intimacy — the familiarity . I can not think of it with any patience ; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must , if possible , be prevented . Do not you see it in the same light ? ”
60899	60914	60675	60675	Her	1392	“ Yes ; but what can be done ? Your brother is so determined . ”
60915	60944	60949	60949	him	1396	“ There is but one thing to be done , Fanny . I must take Anhalt myself . I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom . ”
60951	60961	60962	60962	he	1396	“ It is not at all what I like , ”
60965	61027	60962	60962	he	1396	“ No man can like being driven into the appearance of such inconsistency . After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning , there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now , when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect ; but I can think of no other alternative . Can you , Fanny ? ”
61028	61031	61033	61033	Fanny	111	“ No , ”
61036	61042	61033	61033	Fanny	111	“ not immediately , but — ”
61043	61260	60675	60675	Her	1392	“ But what ? I see your judgment is not with me . Think it a little over . Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that may , of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man ’s being received in this manner : domesticated among us ; authorised to come at all hours , and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints . To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create . It is all very bad ! Put yourself in Miss Crawford ’s place , Fanny . Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger . She has a right to be felt for , because she evidently feels for herself . I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger ; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations — perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be — it would be ungenerous , it would be really wrong to expose her to it . Her feelings ought to be respected . Does it not strike you so , Fanny ? You hesitate . ”
61261	61311	60962	60962	he	1396	“ I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . It will be such a triumph to the others ! ”
61312	61471	61033	61033	Fanny	111	“ They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I act . But , however , triumph there certainly will be , and I must brave it . But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business , of limiting the exhibition , of concentrating our folly , I shall be well repaid . As I am now , I have no influence , I can do nothing : I have offended them , and they will not hear me ; but when I have put them in good - humour by this concession , I am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for . This will be a material gain . My object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants . Will not this be worth gaining ? ”
61472	61482	60675	60675	Her	1392	“ Yes , it will be a great point . ”
61483	61509	60962	60962	he	1396	“ But still it has not your approbation . Can you mention any other measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good ? ”
61510	61521	61033	61033	Fanny	111	“ No , I can not think of anything else . ”
61522	61539	60675	60675	Her	1392	“ Give me your approbation , then , Fanny . I am not comfortable without it . ”
61540	61545	60675	60675	Her	1392	“ Oh , cousin ! ”
61546	61618	61033	61033	Fanny	111	“ If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet — But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act — no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough . I thought you would have entered more into Miss Crawford ’s feelings . ”
61619	61637	61639	61639	Fanny	111	“ No doubt she will be very glad . It must be a great relief to her , ”
61648	61674	61639	61639	Fanny	111	“ She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night . It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill . ”
61675	61691	61693	61693	She	1397	“ She was very kind , indeed , and I am glad to have her spared ”
61714	61723	61725	61725	he	105	“ I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , ”
61727	61872	61725	61725	he	105	“ and am sure of giving pleasure there . And now , dear Fanny , I will not interrupt you any longer . You want to be reading . But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you , and come to a decision . Sleeping or waking , my head has been full of this matter all night . It is an evil , but I am certainly making it less than it might be . If Tom is up , I shall go to him directly and get it over , and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good - humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity . You , in the meanwhile , will be taking a trip into China , I suppose . How does Lord Macartney go on?”—opening
61885	61955	61956	61956	He	1398	“ And here are Crabbe ’s Tales , and the Idler , at hand to relieve you , if you tire of your great book . I admire your little establishment exceedingly ; and as soon as I am gone , you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting , and sit comfortably down to your table . But do not stay here to be cold . ”
62377	62407	62455	62456	Mrs. Norris	102	“ To have it quite in their own family circle was what they had particularly wished . A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort ”
62493	62496	62498	62498	Tom	98	“ Perhaps , ”
62500	62517	62498	62498	Tom	98	“ Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now . Perhaps you may persuade her . ”
62518	62532	62490	62490	his	111	“ No , she is quite determined . She certainly will not act . ”
62533	62539	62498	62498	Tom	98	“ Oh ! very well . ”
62616	62635	62592	62592	hers	125	“ He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . ”
63462	63474	63476	63476	her	121	“ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ”
63481	63488	63490	63490	Mary	129	“ I dare say she is , ”
63493	63500	63490	63490	Mary	129	“ I imagine both sisters are . ”
63501	63527	63476	63476	her	121	“ Both ! no , no , that must not be . Do not give him a hint of it . Think of Mr. Rushworth ! ”
63528	63595	63476	63476	her	121	“ You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth . It may do her some good . I often think of Mr. Rushworth ’s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him . A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . ”
63596	63639	63490	63490	Mary	129	“ I dare say he will be in parliament soon . When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet . ”
63640	63654	63656	63656	Mary	129	“ Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ”
63662	63734	63656	63656	Mary	129	“ Do you remember Hawkins Browne ’s ‘ Address to Tobacco , ’ in imitation of Pope ? — Blest leaf ! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty , to Parsons sense . I will parody them — Blest Knight ! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence , to Rushworth sense . Will not that do , Mrs. Grant ? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas ’s return . ”
63735	63873	63490	63490	Mary	129	“ You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you . I do not think we do so well without him . He has a fine dignified manner , which suits the head of such a house , and keeps everybody in their place . Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order . But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry . I am sure Julia does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends , I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ”
63874	63895	63656	63656	Mary	129	“ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ”
63896	63954	63490	63490	Mary	129	“ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
65100	65160	65087	65088	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ? For the life and soul of me , I can not admire him ; and , between ourselves , to see such an undersized , little , mean - looking man , set up for a fine actor , is very ridiculous in my opinion . ”
65488	65492	65493	65493	she	102	it—“Come , Fanny , ”
65496	65633	65493	65493	she	102	“ these are fine times for you , but you must not be always walking from one room to the other , and doing the lookings - on at your ease , in this way ; I want you here . I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth ’s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . There are but three seams ; you may do them in a trice . It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do . You are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than you , we should not get on very fast . ”
65656	65735	65650	65650	Bertram	124	“ One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny should be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , I mean to look in at their rehearsals too . What is the play about , Fanny ? you have never told me . ”
65736	65772	65650	65650	Bertram	124	“ Oh ! sister , pray do not ask her now ; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time . It is about Lovers ’ Vows . ”
65773	65777	65779	65779	Fanny	111	“ I believe , ”
65785	65812	65779	65779	Fanny	111	“ there will be three acts rehearsed to - morrow evening , and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once . ”
65813	65824	65826	65827	Mrs. Norris	102	“ You had better stay till the curtain is hung , ”
65829	65871	65826	65827	Mrs. Norris	102	“ the curtain will be hung in a day or two — there is very little sense in a play without a curtain — and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . ”
66204	66242	66201	66202	Miss Crawford	125	“ Am I right ? Yes ; this is the East room . My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . ”
66273	66400	66401	66401	Fanny	111	“ Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . Allow me to stay here a little while , and do have the goodness to hear me my third act . I have brought my book , and if you would but rehearse it with me , I should be so obliged ! I came here to - day intending to rehearse it with Edmund — by ourselves — against the evening , but he is not in the way ; and if he were , I do not think I could go through it with him , till I have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . You will be so good , wo n’t you ? ”
66421	66434	66436	66437	Miss Crawford	125	“ Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? ”
66443	66538	66436	66437	Miss Crawford	125	“ Here it is . I did not think much of it at first — but , upon my word . There , look at that speech , and that , and that . How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things ? Could you do it ? But then he is your cousin , which makes all the difference . You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy you him , and get on by degrees . You have a look of his sometimes . ”
66539	66569	66410	66410	she	1499	“ Have I ? I will do my best with the greatest readiness ; but I must read the part , for I can say very little of it . ”
66570	66846	66847	66847	She	1500	“ None of it , I suppose . You are to have the book , of course . Now for it . We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage . There — very good school - room chairs , not made for a theatre , I dare say ; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson . What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose ? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now , he would bless himself , for we are rehearsing all over the house . Yates is storming away in the dining - room . I heard him as I came upstairs , and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers , Agatha and Frederick . If they are not perfect , I shall be surprised . By the bye , I looked in upon them five minutes ago , and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying not to embrace , and Mr. Rushworth was with me . I thought he began to look a little queer , so I turned it off as well as I could , by whispering to him , ‘ We shall have an excellent Agatha ; there is something so maternal in her manner , so completely maternal in her voice and countenance . ’ Was not that well done of me ? He brightened up directly . Now for my soliloquy . ”
67597	67603	67605	67605	she	121	“ Dr. Grant is ill , ”
67611	67644	67605	67605	she	121	“ He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today . He fancied it tough , sent away his plate , and has been suffering ever since ”
67742	67756	67757	67757	She	121	“ If Miss Price would be so good as to read the part . ”
67772	67786	67769	67769	Edmund	105	“ Do , Fanny , if it is not very disagreeable to you . ”
67867	67876	67878	67879	Henry Crawford	128	“ You have only to read the part , ”
67885	67898	67900	67900	Maria	124	“ And I do believe she can say every word of it , ”
67902	67927	67900	67900	Maria	124	“ for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places . Fanny , I am sure you know the part . ”
68053	68068	68039	68039	Julia	110	“ My father is come ! He is in the hall at this moment . ”
68226	68240	68195	68196	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ What will become of us ? what is to be done now ? ”
68378	68389	68369	68369	she	110	“ I need not be afraid of appearing before him . ”
68536	68560	68529	68530	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ Shall I go too ? Had not I better go too ? Will not it be right for me to go too ? ”
69001	69045	69046	69046	Fanny	111	“ he preferred remaining where he was , that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he was come ; and besides , he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away . ”
69198	69211	69185	69186	Sir Thomas	98	“ But where is Fanny ? Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and
70295	70325	70284	70284	she	102	“ Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea . Do have a basin of soup . ”
70333	70348	70284	70284	she	102	“ Still the same anxiety for everybody ’s comfort , my dear Mrs. Norris , ”
70353	70364	70284	70284	she	102	“ But indeed I would rather have nothing but tea . ”
70365	70394	70395	70395	She	102	“ Well , then , Lady Bertram , suppose you speak for tea directly ; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little ; he seems behindhand to - night . ”
70474	70504	70467	70467	her	102	“ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir Thomas ? They have been acting . We have been all alive with acting . ”
70505	70515	70467	70467	her	102	“ Indeed ! and what have you been acting ? ”
70516	70527	70467	70467	her	102	“ Oh ! they ’ll tell you all about it . ”
70528	70536	70538	70538	Tom	98	“ The all will soon be told , ”
70546	70763	70538	70538	Tom	98	“ but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now . You will hear enough of it to - morrow , sir . We have just been trying , by way of doing something , and amusing my mother , just within the last week , to get up a few scenes , a mere trifle . We have had such incessant rains almost since October began , that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together . I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd . Tolerable sport the first three days , but there has been no attempting anything since . The first day I went over Mansfield Wood , and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton , and we brought home six brace between us , and might each have killed six times as many , but we respect your pheasants , sir , I assure you , as much as you could desire . I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were . I never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year . I hope you will take a day ’s sport there yourself , sir , soon . ”
70858	70864	70866	70866	he	105	“ Something must be done , ”
70868	70878	70880	70880	Maria	124	“ It is time to think of our visitors , ”
70900	70910	70911	70911	Fanny	111	“ Where did you leave Miss Crawford , Fanny ? ”
70922	70930	70932	70932	Tom	98	“ Then poor Yates is all alone , ”
70934	70954	70932	70932	Tom	98	“ I will go and fetch him . He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out . ”
71395	71399	71394	71397	the “ particular friend	4956	“ particular friend , ”
71677	71684	71686	71686	he	98	“ I come from your theatre , ”
71694	71765	71686	71686	he	98	“ I found myself in it rather unexpectedly . Its vicinity to my own room — but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character . It appears a neat job , however , as far as I could judge by candlelight , and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit . ”
71927	71940	71942	71942	Tom	98	“ This was , in fact , the origin of our acting , ”
71950	72002	71942	71942	Tom	98	“ My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford , and it spread — as those things always spread , you know , sir — the faster , probably , from your having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly . It was like treading old ground again . ”
72239	72255	72256	72256	She	1622	“ On your judgment , Edmund , I depended ; what have you been about ? ”
72271	72290	72265	72265	her	1622	“ Oh , not to him ! Look so to all the others , but not to him ! ”
72297	72402	72291	72292	Mr. Yates	174	“ To own the truth , Sir Thomas , we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening . We were going through the three first acts , and not unsuccessfully upon the whole . Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result . We bespeak your indulgence , you understand , as young performers ; we bespeak your indulgence . ”
72403	72412	72414	72415	Sir Thomas	98	“ My indulgence shall be given , sir , ”
72418	72425	72432	72432	he	98	“ but without any other rehearsal . ”
72435	72445	72432	72432	he	98	“ I come home to be happy and indulgent . ”
72461	72482	72457	72457	he	98	“ Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield . Do you find them agreeable acquaintance ? ”
72520	72545	72496	72496	he	98	“ Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . ”
72554	72593	72546	72547	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ I do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . ”
72611	72620	72622	72623	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ If I must say what I think , ”
72625	72681	72622	72623	Mr. Rushworth	111	“ in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing . It is having too much of a good thing . I am not so fond of acting as I was at first . I think we are a great deal better employed , sitting comfortably here among ourselves , and doing nothing . ”
72695	72807	72682	72683	Sir Thomas	98	“ I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same . It gives me sincere satisfaction . That I should be cautious and quick - sighted , and feel many scruples which my children do not feel , is perfectly natural ; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity , for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures , should much exceed theirs . But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight . ”
73048	73059	73061	73061	he	105	“ We have all been more or less to blame , ”
73063	73121	73061	73061	he	105	“ every one of us , excepting Fanny . Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout ; who has been consistent . Her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last . She never ceased to think of what was due to you . You will find Fanny everything you could wish . ”
73614	73622	73624	73624	she	102	“ If I had not been active , ”
73626	73756	73624	73624	she	102	“ and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . But I left no stone unturned . I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister , and at last I did persuade her . You know the distance to Sotherton ; it was in the middle of winter , and the roads almost impassable , but I did persuade her . ”
73757	73789	73595	73595	She	102	“ I know how great , how justly great , your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children , and am the more concerned that it should not have been — ”
73790	74170	73624	73624	she	102	“ My dear Sir Thomas , if you had seen the state of the roads that day ! I thought we should never have got through them , though we had the four horses of course ; and poor old coachman would attend us , out of his great love and kindness , though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas . I cured him at last ; but he was very bad all the winter — and this was such a day , I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture : he was putting on his wig ; so I said , ‘ Coachman , you had much better not go ; your Lady and I shall be very safe ; you know how steady Stephen is , and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that I am sure there is no fear . ’ But , however , I soon found it would not do ; he was bent upon going , and as I hate to be worrying and officious , I said no more ; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt , and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke , where , what with frost and snow upon beds of stones , it was worse than anything you can imagine , I was quite in an agony about him . And then the poor horses too ! To see them straining away ! You know how I always feel for the horses . And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill , what do you think I did ? You will laugh at me ; but I got out and walked up . I did indeed . It might not be saving them much , but it was something , and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals . I caught a dreadful cold , but that I did not regard . My object was accomplished in the visit . ”
74171	74245	73624	73624	she	102	“ I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it . There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth ’s manners , but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject : his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting . He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish . ”
74246	74345	73595	73595	She	102	“ Yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing . ‘ Upon my word , Mrs. Norris , ’ said Mrs. Grant the other day , ‘ if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own , he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect . ’ ”
75393	75408	75410	75410	he	98	“ From Bath , Norfolk , London , York , wherever I may be , ”
75412	75429	75410	75410	he	98	“ I will attend you from any place in England , at an hour ’s notice . ”
75455	75478	75447	75447	He	98	“ I am sorry you are going ; but as to our play , that is all over — entirely at an end ”
75487	75529	75447	75447	He	98	“ The painter was sent off yesterday , and very little will remain of the theatre to - morrow . I knew how that would be from the first . It is early for Bath . You will find nobody there . ”
75530	75540	75447	75447	He	98	“ It is about my uncle ’s usual time . ”
75541	75549	75447	75447	He	98	“ When do you think of going ? ”
75550	75565	75447	75447	He	98	“ I may , perhaps , get as far as Banbury to - day . ”
75566	75575	75447	75447	He	98	“ Whose stables do you use at Bath ? ”
76438	76442	76443	76443	he	105	“ But they , ”
76448	76603	76443	76443	he	105	“ have a claim . They seem to belong to us ; they seem to be part of ourselves . I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away . I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected . But the truth is , that my father hardly knows them . They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England . If he knew them better , he would value their society as it deserves ; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like . We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease . Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father . ”
76604	76610	76612	76612	Fanny	111	“ Do you think so ? ”
76614	76776	76612	76612	Fanny	111	“ in my opinion , my uncle would not like any addition . I think he values the very quietness you speak of , and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants . And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be — I mean before my uncle went abroad . As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same . There was never much laughing in his presence ; or , if there is any difference , it is not more , I think , than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first . There must be a sort of shyness ; but I can not recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry , except when my uncle was in town . No young people ’s are , I suppose , when those they look up to are at home ”
76778	76787	76789	76789	his	1715	“ I believe you are right , Fanny , ”
76797	76851	76789	76789	his	1715	“ I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were , than assuming a new character . The novelty was in their being lively . Yet , how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give ! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . ”
76852	76862	76864	76864	Fanny	111	“ I suppose I am graver than other people , ”
76866	76921	76864	76864	Fanny	111	“ The evenings do not appear long to me . I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies . I could listen to him for an hour together . It entertains me more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . ”
76922	76930	76789	76789	his	1715	“ Why should you dare say that ? ”
76935	77033	76789	76789	his	1715	“ Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet ? But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ? Go to my father if you want to be complimented . He will satisfy you . Ask your uncle what he thinks , and you will hear compliments enough : and though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . ”
77047	77194	76864	76864	Fanny	111	“ Your uncle thinks you very pretty , dear Fanny — and that is the long and the short of the matter . Anybody but myself would have made something more of it , and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before ; but the truth is , that your uncle never did admire you till now — and now he does . Your complexion is so improved!—and you have gained so much countenance!—and your figure — nay , Fanny , do not turn away about it — it is but an uncle . If you can not bear an uncle ’s admiration , what is to become of you ? You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at . You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman . ”
77195	77208	77210	77210	Fanny	111	“ Oh ! do n’t talk so , do n’t talk so , ”
77242	77281	77229	77229	he	1717	“ Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect ; and I only wish you would talk to him more . You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle . ”
77282	77315	76864	76864	Fanny	111	“ But I do talk to him more than I used . I am sure I do . Did not you hear me ask him about the slave - trade last night ? ”
77316	77345	76864	76864	Fanny	111	“ I did — and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others . It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther . ”
77346	77424	76864	76864	Fanny	111	“ And I longed to do it — but there was such a dead silence ! And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like — I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . ”
77425	77650	76864	76864	Fanny	111	“ Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect . We were talking of you at the Parsonage , and those were her words . She has great discernment . I know nobody who distinguishes characters better . For so young a woman it is remarkable ! She certainly understands you better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define many as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it . I wonder what she thinks of my father ! She must admire him as a fine - looking man , with most gentlemanlike , dignified , consistent manners ; but perhaps , having seen him so seldom , his reserve may be a little repulsive . Could they be much together , I feel sure of their liking each other . He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers . I wish they met more frequently ! I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side . ”
77651	77668	77670	77670	Fanny	111	“ She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , ”
77677	77743	77670	77670	Fanny	111	“ to have any such apprehension . And Sir Thomas ’s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that . After a little while , I dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year . ”
77744	77801	77802	77802	Fanny	111	“ This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy . I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ”
77873	77915	77865	77865	she	125	“ To - morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too . We shall be quite a small party at home . I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . ”
77916	78001	77865	77865	she	125	“ That is impossible , Fanny . He must like him less after to - morrow ’s visit , for we shall be five hours in his company . I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow — the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas . He can not much longer deceive himself . I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ”
79842	79847	79855	79855	her	110	“ Where is Fanny ? ”
80586	80594	80564	80565	Miss Crawford	125	“ Shall I play to you now ? ”
80596	80602	80564	80565	Miss Crawford	125	“ What will you have ? ”
80678	80685	80687	80688	Miss Crawford	125	“ Another quarter of an hour , ”
80690	80717	80687	80688	Miss Crawford	125	“ and we shall see how it will be . Do not run away the first moment of its holding up . Those clouds look alarming . ”
80718	80725	80727	80727	Fanny	111	“ But they are passed over , ”
80729	80744	80727	80727	Fanny	111	“ I have been watching them . This weather is all from the south . ”
80745	80807	80811	80811	she	125	“ South or north , I know a black cloud when I see it ; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening . And besides , I want to play something more to you — a very pretty piece — and your cousin Edmund ’s prime favourite . You must stay and hear your cousin ’s favourite . ”
81218	81226	81228	81228	Fanny	111	“ This is pretty , very pretty , ”
81242	81356	81365	81365	she	125	“ every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty . Three years ago , this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field , never thought of as anything , or capable of becoming anything ; and now it is converted into a walk , and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament ; and perhaps , in another three years , we may be forgetting — almost forgetting what it was before . How wonderful , how very wonderful the operations of time , and the changes of the human mind ! ”
81370	81481	81365	81365	she	125	“ If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest , I do think it is memory . There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers , the failures , the inequalities of memory , than in any other of our intelligences . The memory is sometimes so retentive , so serviceable , so obedient ; at others , so bewildered and so weak ; and at others again , so tyrannic , so beyond control ! We are , to be sure , a miracle every way ; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out . ”
81512	81554	81495	81495	Fanny	111	“ It may seem impertinent in me to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this . There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk ! Not too much attempted ! ”
81555	81558	81560	81561	Miss Crawford	125	“ Yes , ”
81564	81613	81560	81561	Miss Crawford	125	“ it does very well for a place of this sort . One does not think of extent here ; and between ourselves , till I came to Mansfield , I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery , or anything of the kind . ”
81614	81625	81627	81627	Fanny	111	“ I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive ! ”
81632	81791	81627	81627	Fanny	111	“ My uncle ’s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own , and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general . The evergreen ! How beautiful , how welcome , how wonderful the evergreen ! When one thinks of it , how astonishing a variety of nature ! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety , but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence . You will think me rhapsodising ; but when I am out of doors , especially when I am sitting out of doors , I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain . One can not fix one ’s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy . ”
81792	81798	81800	81801	Miss Crawford	125	“ To say the truth , ”
81803	81897	81800	81801	Miss Crawford	125	“ I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV . ; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it . If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them . I have now been here nearly five months ; and , moreover , the quietest five months I ever passed . ”
81898	81907	81627	81627	Fanny	111	“ Too quiet for you , I believe . ”
81908	81919	81925	81925	she	1813	“ I should have thought so theoretically myself , but , ”
81928	81946	81925	81925	she	1813	“ take it all and all , I never spent so happy a summer . But then , ”
81956	81967	81925	81925	she	1813	“ there is no saying what it may lead to . ”
81999	82146	81986	81987	Miss Crawford	125	“ I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . I can even suppose it pleasant to spend half the year in the country , under certain circumstances , very pleasant . An elegant , moderate - sized house in the centre of family connexions ; continual engagements among them ; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood ; looked up to , perhaps , as leading it even more than those of larger fortune , and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a tête - à - tête with the person one feels most agreeable in the world . There is nothing frightful in such a picture , is there , Miss Price ? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as that . ”
82147	82152	82275	82275	she	125	“ Envy Mrs. Rushworth ! ”
82161	82251	82252	82252	Fanny	111	“ Come , come , it would be very un - handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth , for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay , brilliant , happy hours . I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year . Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth ’s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . ”
82278	82285	82275	82275	she	125	“ Ah ! here he is . ”
82307	82360	82304	82305	Mrs. Grant	121	“ My sister and Mr. Bertram . I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be Mr. Bertram again . There is something in the sound of Mr. Edmund Bertram so formal , so pitiful , so younger - brother - like , that I detest it . ”
82361	82367	82369	82369	Fanny	111	“ How differently we feel ! ”
82371	82446	82369	82369	Fanny	111	“ To me , the sound of Mr. Bertram is so cold and nothing - meaning , so entirely without warmth or character ! It just stands for a gentleman , and that ’s all . But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund . It is a name of heroism and renown ; of kings , princes , and knights ; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections . ”
82447	82525	82526	82526	Edmund	105	“ I grant you the name is good in itself , and Lord Edmund or Sir Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . Well , shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year , by being up before they can begin ? ”
82615	82618	82620	82621	Miss Crawford	125	“ Well , ”
82623	82662	82620	82621	Miss Crawford	125	“ and do you not scold us for our imprudence ? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it , and entreated and supplicated never to do so again ? ”
82663	82670	82672	82672	Edmund	105	“ Perhaps I might have scolded , ”
82674	82699	82672	82672	Edmund	105	“ if either of you had been sitting down alone ; but while you do wrong together , I can overlook a great deal . ”
82700	82709	82711	82712	Mrs. Grant	121	“ They can not have been sitting long , ”
82714	82737	82711	82712	Mrs. Grant	121	“ for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . ”
82738	82742	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ And really , ”
82746	82790	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar . We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May . ”
82791	82796	82798	82799	Miss Crawford	125	“ Upon my word , ”
82801	82914	82798	82799	Miss Crawford	125	“ you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with ! There is no giving you a moment ’s uneasiness . You do not know how much we have been suffering , nor what chills we have felt ! But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on , in any little manoeuvre against common sense , that a woman could be plagued with . I had very little hope of him from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . ”
82915	83109	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . You have not the smallest chance of moving me . I have my alarms , but they are quite in a different quarter ; and if I could have altered the weather , you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time — for here are some of my plants which Robert will leave out because the nights are so mild , and I know the end of it will be , that we shall have a sudden change of weather , a hard frost setting in all at once , taking everybody ( at least Robert ) by surprise , and I shall lose every one ; and what is worse , cook has just been telling me that the turkey , which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday , because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day , will not keep beyond to - morrow . These are something like grievances , and make me think the weather most unseasonably close . ”
83110	83120	83122	83123	Miss Crawford	125	“ The sweets of housekeeping in a country village ! ”
83126	83136	83122	83123	Miss Crawford	125	“ Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer . ”
83137	83187	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul ’s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . But we have no such people in Mansfield . What would you have me do ? ”
83188	83212	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ Oh ! you can do nothing but what you do already : be plagued very often , and never lose your temper . ”
83213	83291	83122	83123	Miss Crawford	125	“ Thank you ; but there is no escaping these little vexations , Mary , live where we may ; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you , I dare say I shall find you with yours , in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer , perhaps on their very account . Their remoteness and unpunctuality , or their exorbitant charges and frauds , will be drawing forth bitter lamentations . ”
83292	83336	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort . A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of . It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it . ”
83337	83345	83347	83347	Edmund	105	“ You intend to be very rich ? ”
83367	83381	83347	83347	Edmund	105	“ To be sure . Do not you ? Do not we all ? ”
83382	83441	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ I can not intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command . Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth . She has only to fix on her number of thousands a year , and there can be no doubt of their coming . My intentions are only not to be poor . ”
83442	83574	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ By moderation and economy , and bringing down your wants to your income , and all that . I understand you — and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life , with such limited means and indifferent connexions . What can you want but a decent maintenance ? You have not much time before you ; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you , or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence . Be honest and poor , by all means — but I shall not envy you ; I do not much think I shall even respect you . I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich . ”
83575	83643	83347	83347	Edmund	105	“ Your degree of respect for honesty , rich or poor , is precisely what I have no manner of concern with . I do not mean to be poor . Poverty is exactly what I have determined against . Honesty , in the something between , in the middle state of worldly circumstances , is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on . ”
83644	83676	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ But I do look down upon it , if it might have been higher . I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction . ”
83677	83695	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ But how may it rise ? How may my honesty at least rise to any distinction ? ”
83710	83713	82744	82744	Edmund	105	“ Oh ! ”
83726	83746	83722	83722	she	1818	“ You ought to be in parliament , or you should have gone into the army ten years ago . ”
83747	83794	83795	83795	he	1819	“ That is not much to the purpose now ; and as to my being in parliament , I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on . No , Miss Crawford , ”
83804	83837	83795	83795	he	1819	“ there are distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance — absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining — but they are of a different character . ”
84198	84211	84181	84181	she	1818	“ but she did not suppose it would be in her power , ”
84326	84336	84338	84339	Mrs. Grant	121	“ And you know what your dinner will be , ”
84341	84358	84338	84339	Mrs. Grant	121	smiling—“the turkey , and I assure you a very fine one ; for , my dear , ”
84364	84377	84338	84339	Mrs. Grant	121	“ cook insists upon the turkey ’s being dressed to - morrow . ”
84378	84385	84387	84388	Dr. Grant	118	“ Very well , very well , ”
84390	84479	84387	84388	Dr. Grant	118	“ all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house . But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram , I dare say , would take their chance . We none of us want to hear the bill of fare . A friendly meeting , and not a fine dinner , is all we have in view . A turkey , or a goose , or a leg of mutton , or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us . ”
84548	84557	84559	84560	Lady Bertram	103	“ But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny ? ”
84562	84615	84559	84560	Lady Bertram	103	“ How came she to think of asking Fanny ? Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way . I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . Fanny , you do not want to go , do you ? ”
84616	84626	84628	84628	Edmund	105	“ If you put such a question to her , ”
84636	84669	84628	84628	Edmund	105	“ Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure , my dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . ”
84670	84705	84559	84560	Lady Bertram	103	“ I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ? She never did before . She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny . ”
84706	84717	84719	84719	Fanny	111	“ If you can not do without me , ma’am — ”
84728	84742	84719	84719	Fanny	111	“ But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . ”
84743	84752	84628	84628	Edmund	105	“ To be sure , so I shall . ”
84753	84764	84628	84628	Edmund	105	“ Suppose you take my father ’s opinion , ma’am . ”
84765	84798	84628	84628	Edmund	105	“ That ’s well thought of . So I will , Edmund . I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ”
84799	84860	84628	84628	Edmund	105	“ As you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the first invitation it should be accepted . ”
84861	84888	84628	84628	Edmund	105	“ I do not know . We will ask him . But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . ”
84980	84996	84965	84965	she	1833	“ Sir Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you . ”
85153	85172	85148	85149	Lady Bertram	103	with—“I have something to tell you that will surprise you . Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . ”
85173	85176	85178	85179	Sir Thomas	98	“ Well , ”
85190	85204	85178	85179	Sir Thomas	98	“ Edmund wants her to go . But how can I spare her ? ”
85205	85211	85213	85214	Sir Thomas	98	“ She will be late , ”
85221	85228	85213	85214	Sir Thomas	98	“ but what is your difficulty ? ”
85258	85271	85252	85252	she	607	“ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ”
85272	85280	85282	85282	Edmund	105	“ But is it not very natural , ”
85284	85300	85282	85282	Edmund	105	“ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ”
85301	85308	85310	85311	Sir Thomas	98	“ Nothing can be more natural , ”
85318	85432	85310	85311	Sir Thomas	98	“ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . Mrs. Grant ’s shewing civility to Miss Price , to Lady Bertram ’s niece , could never want explanation . The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the first time of its being paid . Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer . She appears to feel as she ought . But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ”
85433	85444	85282	85282	Edmund	105	“ But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? ”
85445	85452	85310	85311	Sir Thomas	98	“ Indeed I think you may . ”
85453	85469	85310	85311	Sir Thomas	98	“ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ”
85470	85495	85282	85282	Edmund	105	“ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ”
85496	85508	85310	85311	Sir Thomas	98	“ Very well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . ”
85528	85561	85516	85516	Edmund	105	“ Well , Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle ’s side . He had but one opinion . You are to go . ”
85562	85571	85522	85522	his	105	“ Thank you , I am so glad , ”
85596	85620	85580	85580	she	1840	“ And yet why should I be glad ? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? ”
85783	85964	85965	85966	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Upon my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence ! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to you ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me . Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to us to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . ”
86032	86261	86262	86263	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Oh ! depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go . I shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt . And I hope you will have a very agreeable day , and find it all mighty delightful . But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an elegant lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better ! And round their enormous great wide table , too , which fills up the room so dreadfully ! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining - table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner - table here , how infinitely better it would have been ! and how much more he would have been respected ! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere . Remember that , Fanny . Five — only five to be sitting round that table . However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . ”
86272	86427	86262	86263	Mrs. Norris	102	“ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give you a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . That will never do , believe me . Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage , you are not to be taking place of her . And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses . Leave him to settle that . ”
86428	86441	86262	86263	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Yes , ma’am , I should not think of anything else . ”
86442	86533	86534	86534	Her	1849	“ And if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you . I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly . ”
86570	86584	86558	86559	Sir Thomas	98	“ Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ”
86600	86606	86608	86609	Mrs. Norris	102	“ My dear Sir Thomas ! ”
86615	86620	86608	86609	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Fanny can walk . ”
86621	86624	86626	86627	Sir Thomas	98	“ Walk ! ”
86644	86667	86626	86627	Sir Thomas	98	“ My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year ! Will twenty minutes after four suit you ? ”
86668	86673	86675	86675	Fanny	111	“ Yes , sir , ”
86733	86765	86720	86720	him	299	“ Quite unnecessary ! a great deal too kind ! But Edmund goes ; true , it is upon Edmund ’s account . I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night . ”
86872	86882	86884	86884	Edmund	105	“ Now I must look at you , Fanny , ”
86895	86927	86884	86884	Edmund	105	“ and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . What have you got on ? ”
86928	86993	86891	86893	an affectionate brother	1863	“ The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin ’s marriage . I hope it is not too fine ; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could , and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter . I hope you do not think me too fine . ”
86994	87047	86884	86884	Edmund	105	“ A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white . No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper . Your gown seems very pretty . I like these glossy spots . Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same ? ”
87065	87068	87070	87070	Edmund	105	“ Heyday ! ”
87072	87090	87070	87070	Edmund	105	“ here ’s company , here ’s a carriage ! who have they got to meet us ? ”
87101	87152	87070	87070	Edmund	105	“ ’ Tis Crawford ’s , Crawford ’s barouche , I protest ! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters . He is here , of course . This is quite a surprise , Fanny . I shall be very glad to see him . ”
87739	87757	87736	87736	he	1877	“ So ! Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! ”
87758	87782	87736	87736	he	1877	“ Yes , they have been there about a fortnight , Miss Price , have they not ? And Julia is with them . ”
87783	87796	87736	87736	he	1877	“ And Mr. Yates , I presume , is not far off . ”
87797	87846	87736	87736	he	1877	“ Mr. Yates ! Oh ! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates . I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ? I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . ”
87847	87859	87861	87861	Crawford	125	“ Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! ”
87863	87908	87861	87861	Crawford	125	“ Nobody can ever forget them . Poor fellow ! I see him now — his toil and his despair . Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ”
87917	87929	87933	87933	his	1884	“ She is too good for him — much too good . ”
87949	88040	87946	87946	he	1884	“ You were Mr. Rushworth ’s best friend . Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part — in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied — to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own ! He might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . ”
88048	88059	88060	88060	he	1884	“ It is as a dream , a pleasant dream ! ”
88074	88150	88060	88060	he	1884	“ I shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure . There was such an interest , such an animation , such a spirit diffused . Everybody felt it . We were all alive . There was employment , hope , solicitude , bustle , for every hour of the day . Always some little objection , some little doubt , some little anxiety to be got over . I never was happier . ”
88159	88189	88154	88154	Fanny	111	“ Never happier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly ! Oh ! what a corrupted mind ! ”
88190	88198	88199	88199	he	1884	“ We were unlucky , Miss Price , ”
88226	88335	88336	88336	He	1884	“ we certainly were very unlucky . Another week , only one other week , would have been enough for us . I think if we had had the disposal of events — if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two , about the equinox , there would have been a difference . Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather — but only by a steady contrary wind , or a calm . I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ”
88359	88403	88347	88347	her	1885	“ As far as I am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day . My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough . ”
88475	88495	88502	88502	he	1884	“ I believe you are right . It was more pleasant than prudent . We were getting too noisy . ”
88544	88556	88528	88529	Miss Crawford	125	“ Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ”
88557	88565	88567	88567	her	1885	“ The most interesting in the world , ”
88568	88717	88718	88718	His	1887	brother—“how to make money ; how to turn a good income into a better . Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon . I find he takes orders in a few weeks . They were at it in the dining - parlour . I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off . He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with , and earned without much trouble . I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year . Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his menus plaisirs ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice . ”
88729	88777	88718	88718	His	1887	“ Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves . You would look rather blank , Henry , if your menus plaisirs were to be limited to seven hundred a year . ”
88778	88840	88718	88718	His	1887	“ Perhaps I might ; but all that you know is entirely comparative . Birthright and habit must settle the business . Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet ’s family . By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it . ”
88893	88896	88898	88899	Henry Crawford	128	“ Bertram , ”
88901	89024	88898	88899	Henry Crawford	128	“ I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon . I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner . When is it to be ? Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time — as I shall do — not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil . When will it be ? You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . ”
89025	89041	89043	89043	Edmund	105	“ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ”
89045	89074	89043	89043	Edmund	105	“ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ”
89075	89082	89084	89084	Fanny	111	“ Will he not feel this ? ”
89086	89097	89084	89084	Fanny	111	“ No , he can feel nothing as he ought . ”
89461	89517	89427	89427	he	128	“ And how do you think I mean to amuse myself , Mary , on the days that I do not hunt ? I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week ; but I have a plan for the intermediate days , and what do you think it is ? ”
89518	89530	89427	89427	he	128	“ To walk and ride with me , to be sure . ”
89531	89606	89427	89427	he	128	“ Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but that would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . Besides , that would be all recreation and indulgence , without the wholesome alloy of labour , and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness . No , my plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me . ”
89607	89627	89427	89427	he	128	“ Fanny Price ! Nonsense ! No , no . You ought to be satisfied with her two cousins . ”
89628	89841	89427	89427	he	128	“ But I can not be satisfied without Fanny Price , without making a small hole in Fanny Price ’s heart . You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice . When we talked of her last night , you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks . You see her every day , and therefore do not notice it ; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn . She was then merely a quiet , modest , not plain - looking girl , but she is now absolutely pretty . I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance ; but in that soft skin of hers , so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday , there is decided beauty ; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth , I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express . And then , her air , her manner , her tout ensemble , is so indescribably improved ! She must be grown two inches , at least , since October . ”
89842	90032	90033	90033	Her	1902	“ Phoo ! phoo ! This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with , and because she has got a new gown , and you never saw her so well dressed before . She is just what she was in October , believe me . The truth is , that she was the only girl in company for you to notice , and you must have a somebody . I have always thought her pretty — not strikingly pretty — but ‘ pretty enough , ’ as people say ; a sort of beauty that grows on one . Her eyes should be darker , but she has a sweet smile ; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement , I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress , and your having nobody else to look at ; and therefore , if you do set about a flirtation with her , you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty , or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly . ”
90048	90187	90033	90033	Her	1902	“ I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny . I do not understand her . I could not tell what she would be at yesterday . What is her character ? Is she solemn ? Is she queer ? Is she prudish ? Why did she draw back and look so grave at me ? I could hardly get her to speak . I never was so long in company with a girl in my life , trying to entertain her , and succeed so ill ! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me ! I must try to get the better of this . Her looks say , ‘ I will not like you , I am determined not to like you ’ ; and I say she shall . ”
90188	90290	90469	90469	she	129	“ Foolish fellow ! And so this is her attraction after all ! This it is , her not caring about you , which gives her such a soft skin , and makes her so much taller , and produces all these charms and graces ! I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy ; a little love , perhaps , may animate and do her good , but I will not have you plunge her deep , for she is as good a little creature as ever lived , and has a great deal of feeling . ”
90291	90300	90302	90302	Henry	128	“ It can be but for a fortnight , ”
90304	90423	90302	90302	Henry	128	“ and if a fortnight can kill her , she must have a constitution which nothing could save . No , I will not do her any harm , dear little soul ! I only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again . I want nothing more . ”
90424	90428	90430	90430	Mary	129	“ Moderation itself ! ”
90432	90461	90430	90430	Mary	129	“ I can have no scruples now . Well , you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself , for we are a great deal together . ”
92099	92167	92091	92091	his	128	“ Do you know , I begin to like that queer fashion already , though when I first heard of such things being done in England , I could not believe it ; and when Mrs. Brown , and the other women at the Commissioner ’s at Gibraltar , appeared in the same trim , I thought they were mad ; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything ”
92561	92577	92553	92553	her	103	“ Dear me ! how disagreeable ! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea . ”
93274	93290	93238	93238	His	229	“ because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined , and Lady Bertram was so indolent ! ”
93589	93608	93582	93584	Luckily Sir Thomas	98	“ What shall I do , Sir Thomas ? Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ”
93646	93650	93652	93653	her ladyship	902	“ Very well , ”
93658	93681	93652	93653	her ladyship	902	“ then speculation , if you please , Mrs. Grant . I know nothing about it , but Fanny must teach me . ”
94082	94093	94060	94061	Mrs. Grant	121	“ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ”
94094	94135	94060	94061	Mrs. Grant	121	“ Oh dear , yes ! very entertaining indeed . A very odd game . I do not know what it is all about . I am never to see my cards ; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest . ”
94136	94139	94141	94141	Crawford	125	“ Bertram , ”
94158	94174	94141	94141	Crawford	125	“ I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home . ”
94227	94399	94529	94530	Thornton Lacey	232	“ I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew - trees , because I can never bear to ask ; but I have not told you that , with my usual luck — for I never do wrong without gaining by it — I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see . I was suddenly , upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field , in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills ; a small stream before me to be forded , a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right — which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place , and not a gentleman or half a gentleman ’s house to be seen excepting one — to be presumed the Parsonage — within a stone ’s throw of the said knoll and church . I found myself , in short , in Thornton Lacey . ”
94400	94406	94408	94408	Edmund	105	“ It sounds like it , ”
94410	94423	94529	94530	Thornton Lacey	232	“ but which way did you turn after passing Sewell ’s farm ? ”
94424	94471	94529	94530	Thornton Lacey	232	“ I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions ; though were I to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour , you would never be able to prove that it was not Thornton Lacey — for such it certainly was . ”
94472	94478	94529	94530	Thornton Lacey	232	“ You inquired , then ? ”
94479	94506	94529	94530	Thornton Lacey	232	“ No , I never inquire . But I told a man mending a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey , and he agreed to it . ”
94507	94528	94529	94530	Thornton Lacey	232	“ You have a good memory . I had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place . ”
94558	94561	94563	94563	Edmund	105	“ Well , ”
94565	94575	94563	94563	Edmund	105	“ and how did you like what you saw ? ”
94576	94602	94529	94530	Thornton Lacey	232	“ Very much indeed . You are a lucky fellow . There will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable . ”
94603	94658	94563	94563	Edmund	105	“ No , no , not so bad as that . The farmyard must be moved , I grant you ; but I am not aware of anything else . The house is by no means bad , and when the yard is removed , there may be a very tolerable approach to it . ”
94659	94922	94563	94563	Edmund	105	“ The farmyard must be cleared away entirely , and planted up to shut out the blacksmith ’s shop . The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north — the entrance and principal rooms , I mean , must be on that side , where the view is really very pretty ; I am sure it may be done . And there must be your approach , through what is at present the garden . You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house ; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world , sloping to the south - east . The ground seems precisely formed for it . I rode fifty yards up the lane , between the church and the house , in order to look about me ; and saw how it might all be . Nothing can be easier . The meadows beyond what will be the garden , as well as what now is , sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north - east , that is , to the principal road through the village , must be all laid together , of course ; very pretty meadows they are , finely sprinkled with timber . They belong to the living , I suppose ; if not , you must purchase them . Then the stream — something must be done with the stream ; but I could not quite determine what . I had two or three ideas . ”
94923	94933	94935	94935	Edmund	105	“ And I have two or three ideas also , ”
94937	95017	94935	94935	Edmund	105	“ and one of them is , that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice . I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty . I think the house and premises may be made comfortable , and given the air of a gentleman ’s residence , without any very heavy expense , and that must suffice me ; and , I hope , may suffice all who care about me . ”
95069	95116	95052	95052	her	125	“ There , I will stake my last like a woman of spirit . No cold prudence for me . I am not born to sit still and do nothing . If I lose the game , it shall not be from not striving for it . ”
95149	95386	95142	95142	Crawford	125	“ My plan may not be the best possible : I had not many minutes to form it in ; but you must do a good deal . The place deserves it , and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of . ( Excuse me , your ladyship must not see your cards . There , let them lie just before you . ) The place deserves it , Bertram . You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman ’s residence . That will be done by the removal of the farmyard ; for , independent of that terrible nuisance , I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman ’s residence , so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage - house — above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year . It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms , with as many roofs as windows ; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse : it is a solid , roomy , mansion - like looking house , such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation , through two centuries at least , and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in . ”
95397	95646	95392	95392	Edmund	105	“ The air of a gentleman ’s residence , therefore , you can not but give it , if you do anything . But it is capable of much more . ( Let me see , Mary ; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen ; no , no , a dozen is more than it is worth . Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen . She will have nothing to say to it . Go on , go on . ) By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character . You may raise it into a place . From being the mere gentleman ’s residence , it becomes , by judicious improvement , the residence of a man of education , taste , modern manners , good connexions . All this may be stamped on it ; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road ; especially as there is no real squire ’s house to dispute the point — a circumstance , between ourselves , to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation . You think with me , I hope ”
95657	95665	95392	95392	Edmund	105	“ Have you ever seen the place ? ”
95711	95773	95708	95708	Crawford	125	“ No , no , you must not part with the queen . You have bought her too dearly , and your brother does not offer half her value . No , no , sir , hands off , hands off . Your sister does not part with the queen . She is quite determined . The game will be yours , ”
95779	95786	95708	95708	Crawford	125	“ it will certainly be yours . ”
95787	95798	95800	95800	Edmund	105	“ And Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ”
95806	95819	95800	95800	Edmund	105	“ Poor Fanny ! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes ! ”
95820	95824	95826	95827	Miss Crawford	125	“ Mr. Bertram , ”
95834	95927	95826	95827	Miss Crawford	125	“ you know Henry to be such a capital improver , that you can not possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help . Only think how useful he was at Sotherton ! Only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive about the grounds , and see his genius take fire . There we went , and there we came home again ; and what was done there is not to be told ! ”
95973	96004	95961	95961	he	2015	“ I can not say there was much done at Sotherton ; but it was a hot day , and we were all walking after each other , and bewildered . ”
96028	96064	96015	96015	he	2015	“ I should be sorry to have my powers of planning judged of by the day at Sotherton . I see things very differently now . Do not think of me as I appeared then . ”
96116	96285	96106	96106	she	102	“ Sotherton ! Yes , that is a place , indeed , and we had a charming day there . William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both . Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations , and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man . They are at Brighton now , you know ; in one of the best houses there , as Mr. Rushworth ’s fine fortune gives them a right to be . I do not exactly know the distance , but when you get back to Portsmouth , if it is not very far off , you ought to go over and pay your respects to them ; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins . ”
96286	96333	96334	96335	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I should be very happy , aunt ; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head ; and if I could get so far , I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that — poor scrubby midshipman as I am . ”
96361	96419	96354	96355	Sir Thomas	98	“ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own . ”
96420	96436	96438	96438	William	229	“ I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else , ”
96862	96904	96842	96842	himself	128	“ I want to be your neighbour , Sir Thomas , as you have , perhaps , heard me telling Miss Price . May I hope for your acquiescence , and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant ? ”
96913	96961	96905	96906	Sir Thomas	98	“ It is the only way , sir , in which I could not wish you established as a permanent neighbour ; but I hope , and believe , that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey . Edmund , am I saying too much ? ”
96992	97064	97074	97075	Sir Thomas	98	“ Certainly , sir , I have no idea but of residence . But , Crawford , though I refuse you as a tenant , come to me as a friend . Consider the house as half your own every winter , and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan , and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring . ”
97065	97072	97074	97075	Sir Thomas	98	“ We shall be the losers , ”
97077	97296	97074	97075	Sir Thomas	98	“ His going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less . It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject , Mr. Crawford . But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident , and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent . Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him . But it will not . He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well - wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ”
97303	97308	97310	97311	Sir Thomas	98	“ I repeat again , ”
97313	97339	97310	97311	Sir Thomas	98	“ that Thornton Lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should not be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier . ”
97346	97350	97352	97352	Edmund	105	“ Sir Thomas , ”
97354	97377	97352	97352	Edmund	105	“ undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest . We must hope his son may prove that he knows it too . ”
97735	97742	97744	97744	William	229	“ This is the assembly night , ”
97746	97760	97744	97744	William	229	“ If I were at Portsmouth I should be at it , perhaps . ”
97761	97773	97705	97705	he	128	“ But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ”
97774	97887	97744	97744	William	229	“ No , Fanny , that I do not . I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too , when I can not have you . And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly , for I might not get a partner . The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission . One might as well be nothing as a midshipman . One is nothing , indeed . You remember the Gregorys ; they are grown up amazing fine girls , but they will hardly speak to me , because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant . ”
97888	97901	97912	97912	she	2047	“ Oh ! shame , shame ! But never mind it , William ”
97916	98047	97912	97912	she	2047	“ It is not worth minding . It is no reflection on you ; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced , more or less , in their time . You must think of that , you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor ’s share , like bad weather and hard living , only with this advantage , that there will be an end to it , that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure . When you are a lieutenant ! only think , William , when you are a lieutenant , how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind . ”
98048	98068	97912	97912	she	2047	“ I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant , Fanny . Everybody gets made but me . ”
98069	98123	98124	98124	She	2048	“ Oh ! my dear William , do not talk so ; do not be so desponding . My uncle says nothing , but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made . He knows , as well as you do , of what consequence it is . ”
98155	98164	98145	98145	each	1122	“ Are you fond of dancing , Fanny ? ”
98165	98176	97912	97912	she	2047	“ Yes , very ; only I am soon tired . ”
98177	98282	98145	98145	each	1122	“ I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance . Have you never any balls at Northampton ? I should like to see you dance , and I ’d dance with you if you would , for nobody would know who I was here , and I should like to be your partner once more . We used to jump about together many a time , did not we ? when the hand - organ was in the street ? I am a pretty good dancer in my way , but I dare say you are a better . ”
98296	98307	98286	98287	his uncle	506	“ Is not Fanny a very good dancer , sir ? ”
98376	98437	98455	98456	Henry Crawford	128	“ I am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your question . I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl ; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her , which , perhaps , we may have an opportunity of doing ere long . ”
98438	98453	98455	98456	Henry Crawford	128	“ I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance , Mr. Price , ”
98461	98485	98455	98456	Henry Crawford	128	“ and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject , to your entire satisfaction . But I believe ”
98492	98518	98455	98456	Henry Crawford	128	“ it must be at some other time . There is one person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of . ”
98679	98751	98676	98677	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Come , Fanny , Fanny , what are you about ? We are going . Do not you see your aunt is going ? Quick , quick ! I can not bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting . You should always remember the coachman and horses . My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ”
98959	99044	98956	98956	he	130	“ I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence . It would give me pleasure to see you both dance . You spoke of the balls at Northampton . Your cousins have occasionally attended them ; but they would not altogether suit us now . The fatigue would be too much for your aunt . I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball . A dance at home would be more eligible ; and if — ”
99045	99053	99055	99056	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Ah , my dear Sir Thomas ! ”
99058	99148	99055	99056	Mrs. Norris	102	“ I knew what was coming . I knew what you were going to say . If dear Julia were at home , or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton , to afford a reason , an occasion for such a thing , you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield . I know you would . If they were at home to grace the ball , a ball you would have this very Christmas . Thank your uncle , William , thank your uncle ! ”
99149	99153	99155	99156	Sir Thomas	98	“ My daughters , ”
99161	99219	99155	99156	Sir Thomas	98	“ have their pleasures at Brighton , and I hope are very happy ; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins . Could we be all assembled , our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete , but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement . ”
99432	99455	99429	99429	she	103	“ that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ”
99741	99747	99736	99736	her	2075	“ how she should be dressed ”
99969	99982	99965	99965	she	103	“ there was , in fact , no trouble in the business . ”
100409	100412	100380	100380	she	103	“ Yes , ”
100416	100419	100380	100380	she	103	“ No . ”
100433	100435	100380	100380	she	103	“ no ”
100438	100440	100380	100380	she	103	“ yes ”
100515	100517	100501	100501	her	103	“ no ”
100647	100649	100669	100669	Edmund	105	“ yes ”
101176	101186	101188	101189	Miss Crawford	125	parts—“But what shall you have by way of necklace ? ”
101191	101201	101188	101189	Miss Crawford	125	“ Shall not you wear your brother ’s cross ? ”
101349	101358	101360	101360	she	125	“ You see what a collection I have , ”
101362	101400	101360	101360	she	125	“ more by half than I ever use or think of . I do not offer them as new . I offer nothing but an old necklace . You must forgive the liberty , and oblige me . ”
101672	101685	101687	101687	she	125	“ When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you , ”
101689	101698	101687	101687	she	125	“ and feel how very kind you were . ”
101699	101714	101716	101717	Miss Crawford	125	“ You must think of somebody else too , when you wear that necklace , ”
101719	101783	101784	101784	Fanny	111	“ You must think of Henry , for it was his choice in the first place . He gave it to me , and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver . It is to be a family remembrancer . The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too . ”
101867	101872	101874	101874	she	125	“ My dear child , ”
101878	101945	101874	101874	she	125	“ what are you afraid of ? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine , and fancy you did not come honestly by it ? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ? or perhaps”—looking
101946	101969	101874	101874	she	125	archly—“you suspect a confederacy between us , and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire ? ”
101981	101986	101988	101989	Miss Crawford	125	“ Well , then , ”
102000	102197	101988	101989	Miss Crawford	125	“ to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . Its being a gift of my brother ’s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it , as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it . He is always giving me something or other . I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half . And as for this necklace , I do not suppose I have worn it six times : it is very pretty , but I never think of it ; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket - box , you have happened to fix on the very one which , if I have a choice , I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other . Say no more against it , I entreat you . Such a trifle is not worth half so many words . ”
102464	102467	102469	102469	he	130	“ Fanny , ”
102488	102668	102485	102485	his	130	“ I beg your pardon for being here . I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand . You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross . You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother ’s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton . I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny . I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends . ”
102708	102720	102703	102703	she	2120	“ Oh ! cousin , stop a moment , pray stop ! ”
102725	102734	102735	102735	she	2120	“ I can not attempt to thank you , ”
102744	102775	102735	102735	she	2120	“ thanks are out of the question . I feel much more than I can possibly express . Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond — ”
102776	102787	102735	102735	she	2120	“ If that is all you have to say , Fanny ”
102794	102809	102735	102735	she	2120	“ No , no , it is not . I want to consult you . ”
102858	102931	102850	102850	she	2120	“ Oh , this is beautiful indeed ! This is the very thing , precisely what I wished for ! This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess . It will exactly suit my cross . They must and shall be worn together . It comes , too , in such an acceptable moment . Oh , cousin , you do not know how acceptable it is . ”
102932	103020	102850	102850	she	2120	“ My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much . I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion . Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours . No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed . It is without a drawback . ”
103059	103072	103038	103038	Edmund	105	“ But what is it that you want to consult me about ? ”
103234	103305	103224	103224	he	105	“ Return the necklace ! No , my dear Fanny , upon no account . It would be mortifying her severely . There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend . Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of ? ”
103306	103319	103321	103321	Fanny	111	“ If it had been given to me in the first instance , ”
103323	103361	103321	103321	Fanny	111	“ I should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother ’s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? ”
103362	103432	103224	103224	he	105	“ She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother ’s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it . No doubt it is handsomer than mine , and fitter for a ballroom . ”
103433	103476	103224	103224	he	105	“ No , it is not handsomer , not at all handsomer in its way , and , for my purpose , not half so fit . The chain will agree with William ’s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace . ”
103477	103706	103707	103707	he	2123	“ For one night , Fanny , for only one night , if it be a sacrifice ; I am sure you will , upon consideration , make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort . Miss Crawford ’s attentions to you have been — not more than you were justly entitled to — I am the last person to think that could be , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the meaning , is not in your nature , I am sure . Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to - morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions . This is my advice . I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure , and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences , resulting principally from situation , no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship . I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise , ”
103716	103727	103710	103710	his	2123	“ between the two dearest objects I have on earth . ”
104199	104213	104167	104167	she	2124	“ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ”
104380	104386	104430	104430	Bertram	105	“ My very dear Fanny , ”
105240	105253	105255	105255	she	2140	“ Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! ”
105266	105269	105307	105307	He	105	“ Fanny , ”
105312	105328	105307	105307	He	105	“ You look tired and fagged , Fanny . You have been walking too far . ”
105329	105340	105307	105307	He	105	“ No , I have not been out at all . ”
105341	105361	105362	105362	Fanny	111	“ Then you have had fatigues within doors , which are worse . You had better have gone out . ”
105429	105437	105439	105439	Edmund	105	“ I come from Dr. Grant ’s , ”
105442	105452	105439	105439	Edmund	105	“ You may guess my errand there , Fanny . ”
105476	105489	105439	105439	Edmund	105	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ”
105526	105529	105530	105530	he	105	“ Yes , ”
105533	105541	105530	105530	he	105	“ she is engaged to me ; but ”
105552	105647	105648	105648	Fanny	111	“ she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me . She is not serious . I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . She never has danced with a clergyman , she says , and she never will . For my own sake , I could wish there had been no ball just at — I mean not this very week , this very day ; to - morrow I leave home . ”
105656	105684	105648	105648	Fanny	111	“ I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . This ought to be a day of pleasure . My uncle meant it so . ”
105685	105739	105648	105648	Fanny	111	“ Oh yes , yes ! and it will be a day of pleasure . It will all end right . I am only vexed for a moment . In fact , it is not that I consider the ball as ill - timed ; what does it signify ? But , Fanny , ”
105754	105896	105648	105648	Fanny	111	“ you know what all this means . You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed . Let me talk to you a little . You are a kind , kind listener . I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it . I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem — gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong . She does not think evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul . ”
105897	105903	105905	105905	Fanny	111	“ The effect of education , ”
105916	105958	105908	105908	Edmund	105	“ Yes , that uncle and aunt ! They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . ”
105981	106023	105959	105959	Fanny	111	“ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . Do not ask advice of me . I am not competent . ”
106024	106101	105908	105908	Edmund	105	“ You are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid . It is a subject on which I should never ask advice ; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked ; and few , I imagine , do ask it , but when they want to be influenced against their conscience . I only want to talk to you . ”
106102	106140	106145	106145	her	2164	“ One thing more . Excuse the liberty ; but take care how you talk to me . Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for . The time may come — ”
106151	106155	106157	106157	Edmund	105	“ Dearest Fanny ! ”
106179	106387	106388	106388	He	2165	“ you are all considerate thought ! But it is unnecessary here . The time will never come . No such time as you allude to will ever come . I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had . You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . How many a time have we talked over her little errors ! You need not fear me ; I have almost given up every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ”
106424	106471	106421	106421	she	2166	“ Yes , cousin , I am convinced that you would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say . Do not check yourself . Tell me whatever you like . ”
107104	107107	107109	107110	Lady Bertram	103	“ Yes , ”
107112	107124	107109	107110	Lady Bertram	103	“ she looks very well . I sent Chapman to her . ”
107125	107133	107135	107136	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Look well ! Oh , yes ! ”
107138	107232	107135	107136	Mrs. Norris	102	“ she has good reason to look well with all her advantages : brought up in this family as she has been , with all the benefit of her cousins ’ manners before her . Only think , my dear Sir Thomas , what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her . The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married . What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand ? ”
107335	107362	107319	107319	Edmund	105	“ You must dance with me , Fanny ; you must keep two dances for me ; any two that you like , except the first . ”
108199	108226	108193	108193	she	125	“ Did he ? Did Edmund ? That was like himself . No other man would have thought of it . I honour him beyond expression . ”
108358	108367	108343	108344	Sir Thomas	98	“ Yes , sir ; to Mr. Crawford , ”
108558	108567	108538	108539	Sir Thomas	98	“ It must be so , my dear , ”
109106	109115	109117	109118	Lady Bertram	103	“ Yes , she does look very well , ”
109123	109136	109140	109140	she	125	“ Chapman helped her to dress . I sent Chapman to her . ”
109202	109219	109221	109222	Mrs. Norris	102	offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ”
109344	109418	109326	109326	she	125	“ Perhaps you can tell me why my brother goes to town to - morrow ? He says he has business there , but will not tell me what . The first time he ever denied me his confidence ! But this is what we all come to . All are supplanted sooner or later . Now , I must apply to you for information . Pray , what is Henry going for ? ”
109430	109435	109437	109438	Miss Crawford	125	“ Well , then , ”
109442	109467	109437	109438	Miss Crawford	125	“ I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother , and of talking of you by the way . ”
109815	109823	109825	109825	he	128	“ I am worn out with civility , ”
109827	109870	109825	109825	he	128	“ I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say . But with you , Fanny , there may be peace . You will not want to be talked to . Let us have the luxury of silence . ”
110159	110163	110165	110165	William	229	“ Poor Fanny ! ”
110187	110223	110165	110165	William	229	“ how soon she is knocked up ! Why , the sport is but just begun . I hope we shall keep it up these two hours . How can you be tired so soon ? ”
110224	110232	110234	110235	Sir Thomas	98	“ So soon ! my good friend , ”
110245	110263	110234	110235	Sir Thomas	98	“ it is three o’clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . ”
110264	110295	110165	110165	William	229	“ Well , then , Fanny , you shall not get up to - morrow before I go . Sleep as long as you can , and never mind me . ”
110296	110301	110165	110165	William	229	“ Oh ! William . ”
110302	110316	110234	110235	Sir Thomas	98	“ What ! Did she think of being up before you set off ? ”
110317	110324	110326	110326	Fanny	111	“ Oh ! yes , sir , ”
110339	110363	110326	110326	Fanny	111	“ I must get up and breakfast with him . It will be the last time , you know ; the last morning . ”
110364	110399	110400	110400	Fanny	111	“ You had better not . He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half - past nine . Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half - past nine ? ”
110424	110429	110326	110326	Fanny	111	“ Well , well ! ”
110434	110442	110444	110444	Crawford	125	“ Yes , half - past nine , ”
110454	110474	110444	110444	Crawford	125	“ and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for me . ”
110483	110512	110444	110444	Crawford	125	“ I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to - morrow . ”
110728	110730	110732	110732	his	130	“ Advise ”
110779	110786	110773	110777	the Lady of Branxholm Hall	2251	“ one moment and no more , ”
111278	111357	111259	111260	Lady Bertram	103	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her ; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ”
111374	111403	111361	111361	her	103	“ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ? did he ? I did not see that ; I should not know one from the other . ”
111467	111479	111481	111482	Lady Bertram	103	“ I can not think what is the matter with me , ”
111492	111534	111481	111482	Lady Bertram	103	“ I feel quite stupid . It must be sitting up so late last night . Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake . I can not work . Fetch the cards ; I feel so very stupid . ”
111577	111605	111606	111606	Fanny	111	game—“And that makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib . You are to deal , ma’am ; shall I deal for you ? ”
111868	111876	111878	111879	Sir Thomas	98	“ We miss our two young men , ”
111944	111953	111955	111956	Sir Thomas	98	“ And there is no reason to suppose , ”
111958	112000	111955	111956	Sir Thomas	98	“ but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent . As to Edmund , we must learn to do without him . This will be the last winter of his belonging to us , as he has done . ”
112001	112004	112006	112007	Lady Bertram	103	“ Yes , ”
112009	112036	112006	112007	Lady Bertram	103	“ but I wish he was not going away . They are all going away , I think . I wish they would stay at home . ”
112181	112183	112172	112173	Lady Bertram	103	“ Yes ”
112201	112235	112236	112237	Sir Thomas	98	“ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did , for now the others are away we feel the good of it . ”
112245	112291	112236	112237	Sir Thomas	98	“ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion . If we have been kind to her , she is now quite as necessary to us . ”
112292	112295	112297	112298	Lady Bertram	103	“ Yes , ”
112301	112316	112297	112298	Lady Bertram	103	“ and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have her . ”
112334	112362	112317	112318	Sir Thomas	98	“ She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ”
112363	112427	112297	112298	Lady Bertram	103	“ And that is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas . Who should invite her ? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . ”
113188	113230	113187	113187	she	125	could—“And how do you like your cousin Edmund ’s staying away so long ? Being the only young person at home , I consider you as the greatest sufferer . You must miss him . Does his staying longer surprise you ? ”
113231	113237	113239	113239	Fanny	111	“ I do not know , ”
113242	113252	113239	113239	Fanny	111	“ Yes ; I had not particularly expected it . ”
113253	113275	113187	113187	she	125	“ Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of . It is the general way all young men do . ”
113276	113292	113187	113187	she	125	“ He did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before . ”
113293	113473	113239	113239	Fanny	111	“ He finds the house more agreeable now . He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield . I should like to have seen him once more , I confess . But you must give my compliments to him . Yes ; I think it must be compliments . Is not there a something wanted , Miss Price , in our language — a something between compliments and — and love — to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together ? So many months ’ acquaintance ! But compliments may be sufficient here . Was his letter a long one ? Does he give you much account of what he is doing ? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? ”
113474	113550	113187	113187	she	125	“ I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines . All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so . A few days longer , or some days longer ; I am not quite sure which . ”
113551	113638	113187	113187	she	125	“ Oh ! if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you . But if he wrote to his father , no wonder he was concise . Who could write chat to Sir Thomas ? If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars . You would have heard of balls and parties . He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody . How many Miss Owens are there ? ”
113639	113644	113239	113239	Fanny	111	“ Three grown up . ”
113645	113650	113187	113187	she	125	“ Are they musical ? ”
113651	113663	113187	113187	she	125	“ I do not at all know . I never heard . ”
113664	113674	113676	113677	Miss Crawford	125	“ That is the first question , you know , ”
113686	113798	113676	113677	Miss Crawford	125	“ which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another . But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies — about any three sisters just grown up ; for one knows , without being told , exactly what they are : all very accomplished and pleasing , and one very pretty . There is a beauty in every family ; it is a regular thing . Two play on the pianoforte , and one on the harp ; and all sing , or would sing if they were taught , or sing all the better for not being taught ; or something like it . ”
113799	113808	113810	113810	Fanny	111	“ I know nothing of the Miss Owens , ”
113813	113897	113810	113810	Fanny	111	“ You know nothing and you care less , as people say . Never did tone express indifference plainer . Indeed , how can one care for those one has never seen ? Well , when your cousin comes back , he will find Mansfield very quiet ; all the noisy ones gone , your brother and mine and myself . I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near . She does not like my going . ”
113904	113915	113917	113917	she	2312	“ You can not doubt your being missed by many , ”
113919	113927	113917	113917	she	2312	“ You will be very much missed . ”
113950	114024	113931	113931	her	125	“ Oh yes ! missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away ; that is , there is a great difference felt . But I am not fishing ; do n’t compliment me . If I am missed , it will appear . I may be discovered by those who want to see me . I shall not be in any doubtful , or distant , or unapproachable region . ”
114067	114072	114074	114074	she	125	“ The Miss Owens , ”
114079	114236	114074	114074	she	125	“ suppose you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey ; how should you like it ? Stranger things have happened . I dare say they are trying for it . And they are quite in the right , for it would be a very pretty establishment for them . I do not at all wonder or blame them . It is everybody ’s duty to do as well for themselves as they can . Sir Thomas Bertram ’s son is somebody ; and now he is in their own line . Their father is a clergyman , and their brother is a clergyman , and they are all clergymen together . He is their lawful property ; he fairly belongs to them . You do n’t speak , Fanny ; Miss Price , you do n’t speak . But honestly now , do not you rather expect it than otherwise ? ”
114237	114240	114242	114242	Fanny	111	“ No , ”
114245	114254	114242	114242	Fanny	111	“ I do not expect it at all . ”
114255	114260	114262	114263	Miss Crawford	125	“ Not at all ! ”
114267	114304	114242	114242	Fanny	111	“ I wonder at that . But I dare say you know exactly — I always imagine you are — perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all — or not at present . ”
114305	114312	114314	114314	Fanny	111	“ No , I do not , ”
114356	114365	114332	114333	Her companion	861	“ He is best off as he is , ”
114571	114585	114586	114586	he	128	“ My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? ”
114602	114612	114614	114614	Mary	129	“ Sitting with them an hour and a half ! ”
114626	114631	114633	114633	he	128	“ Yes , Mary , ”
114654	114702	114633	114633	he	128	“ I could not get away sooner ; Fanny looked so lovely ! I am quite determined , Mary . My mind is entirely made up . Will it astonish you ? No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ”
114817	114822	114824	114824	Henry	128	“ Yes , Mary , ”
114829	114874	114824	114824	Henry	128	“ I am fairly caught . You know with what idle designs I began ; but this is the end of them . I have , I flatter myself , made no inconsiderable progress in her affections ; but my own are entirely fixed . ”
114875	114881	114883	114883	Mary	129	“ Lucky , lucky girl ! ”
114892	115030	114883	114883	Mary	129	“ what a match for her ! My dearest Henry , this must be my first feeling ; but my second , which you shall have as sincerely , is , that I approve your choice from my soul , and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it . You will have a sweet little wife ; all gratitude and devotion . Exactly what you deserve . What an amazing match for her ! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck ; what will she say now ? The delight of all the family , indeed ! And she has some true friends in it ! How they will rejoice ! But tell me all about it ! Talk to me for ever . When did you begin to think seriously about her ? ”
115055	115064	115065	115065	he	2324	“ How the pleasing plague had stolen on him ”
115095	115129	115088	115089	his sister	493	“ Ah , my dear Henry , and this is what took you to London ! This was your business ! You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind . ”
115168	115176	115178	115178	Henry	128	“ When Fanny is known to him , ”
115180	115283	115178	115178	Henry	128	“ he will doat on her . She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . She is the very impossibility he would describe , if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas . But till it is absolutely settled — settled beyond all interference , he shall know nothing of the matter . No , Mary , you are quite mistaken . You have not discovered my business yet . ”
115284	115433	115150	115151	The Admiral	693	“ Well , well , I am satisfied . I know now to whom it must relate , and am in no hurry for the rest . Fanny Price ! wonderful , quite wonderful ! That Mansfield should have done so much for — that you should have found your fate in Mansfield ! But you are quite right ; you could not have chosen better . There is not a better girl in the world , and you do not want for fortune ; and as to her connexions , they are more than good . The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country . She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram ; that will be enough for the world . But go on , go on . Tell me more . What are your plans ? Does she know her own happiness ? ”
115434	115437	115178	115178	Henry	128	“ No . ”
115438	115445	115178	115178	Henry	128	“ What are you waiting for ? ”
115446	115475	115150	115151	The Admiral	693	“ For — for very little more than opportunity . Mary , she is not like her cousins ; but I think I shall not ask in vain . ”
115476	115582	115178	115178	Henry	128	“ Oh no ! you can not . Were you even less pleasing — supposing her not to love you already ( of which , however , I can have little doubt)—you would be safe . The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately . From my soul I do not think she would marry you without love ; that is , if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition , I can suppose it her ; but ask her to love you , and she will never have the heart to refuse . ”
115932	115943	115945	115945	he	128	“ I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , ”
115947	115955	115945	115945	he	128	“ and that is what I want . ”
115983	115991	115992	115992	she	493	“ The more I think of it , ”
115995	116062	115992	115992	she	493	“ the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed . You will both find your good in it . ”
116063	116193	115992	115992	she	493	“ It was bad , very bad in me against such a creature ; but I did not know her then ; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head . I will make her very happy , Mary ; happier than she has ever yet been herself , or ever seen anybody else . I will not take her from Northamptonshire . I shall let Everingham , and rent a place in this neighbourhood ; perhaps Stanwix Lodge . I shall let a seven years ’ lease of Everingham . I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word . I could name three people now , who would give me my own terms and thank me . ”
116194	116197	116199	116199	Mary	129	“ Ha ! ”
116201	116217	116199	116199	Mary	129	“ settle in Northamptonshire ! That is pleasant ! Then we shall be all together . ”
116279	116290	116292	116292	he	435	“ You must give us more than half your time , ”
116294	116329	116292	116292	he	435	“ I can not admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself , for we shall both have a right in you . Fanny will be so truly your sister ! ”
116361	116372	116350	116356	the guest of neither brother nor sister	2345	“ You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire ? ”
116373	116376	116292	116292	he	435	“ Yes . ”
116377	116509	116350	116356	the guest of neither brother nor sister	2345	“ That ’s right ; and in London , of course , a house of your own : no longer with the Admiral . My dearest Henry , the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his , before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions , or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life ! You are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed , look or gesture , would have broken my heart . ”
116510	116577	116578	116578	Mary	129	“ Well , well , we do not think quite alike here . The Admiral has his faults , but he is a very good man , and has been more than a father to me . Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much . You must not prejudice Fanny against him . I must have them love one another . ”
116621	116713	116611	116611	she	129	“ Henry , I think so highly of Fanny Price , that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill - used aunt had to abhor the very name , I would prevent the marriage , if possible ; but I know you : I know that a wife you loved would be the happiest of women , and that even when you ceased to love , she would yet find in you the liberality and good - breeding of a gentleman . ”
116747	116757	116758	116758	he	2352	“ Had you seen her this morning , Mary , ”
116761	116935	116758	116758	he	2352	“ attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt ’s stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman ’s service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to me , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said . Had you seen her so , Mary , you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing . ”
116936	116941	116943	116943	Mary	129	“ My dearest Henry , ”
116954	116981	116943	116943	Mary	129	“ how glad I am to see you so much in love ! It quite delights me . But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say ? ”
116982	117062	117063	117063	he	2354	“ I care neither what they say nor what they feel . They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me , that can attach a man of sense . I wish the discovery may do them any good . And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be , and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness . They will be angry , ”
117078	117220	117063	117063	he	2354	“ Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry . It will be a bitter pill to her ; that is , like other bitter pills , it will have two moments ’ ill flavour , and then be swallowed and forgotten ; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women ’s , though I was the object of them . Yes , Mary , my Fanny will feel a difference indeed : a daily , hourly difference , in the behaviour of every being who approaches her ; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it , that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due . Now she is dependent , helpless , friendless , neglected , forgotten . ”
117221	117247	116943	116943	Mary	129	“ Nay , Henry , not by all ; not forgotten by all ; not friendless or forgotten . Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . ”
117248	117325	117063	117063	he	2354	“ Edmund ! True , I believe he is , generally speaking , kind to her , and so is Sir Thomas in his way ; but it is the way of a rich , superior , long - worded , arbitrary uncle . What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do , what do they do for her happiness , comfort , honour , and dignity in the world , to what I shall do ? ”
117421	117426	117401	117401	she	103	“ Let Sir Thomas know ”
117471	117591	117592	117592	Fanny	111	“ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring . He is made . Your brother is a lieutenant . I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother ’s promotion . Here are the letters which announce it , this moment come to hand . You will , perhaps , like to see them . ”
117828	117838	117840	117840	he	126	“ I will not talk of my own happiness , ”
117842	118201	117840	117840	he	126	“ great as it is , for I think only of yours . Compared with you , who has a right to be happy ? I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world . I have not lost a moment , however . The post was late this morning , but there has not been since a moment ’s delay . How impatient , how anxious , how wild I have been on the subject , I will not attempt to describe ; how severely mortified , how cruelly disappointed , in not having it finished while I was in London ! I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it , for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield . But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire , and exerted himself immediately , there were difficulties from the absence of one friend , and the engagements of another , which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of , and knowing in what good hands I left the cause , I came away on Monday , trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these . My uncle , who is the very best man in the world , has exerted himself , as I knew he would , after seeing your brother . He was delighted with him . I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted , or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise . I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend , as this day does prove it . Now I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest , or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation , than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together . ”
118202	118212	118214	118214	Fanny	111	“ Has this been all your doing , then ? ”
118216	118259	118214	118214	Fanny	111	“ Good heaven ! how very , very kind ! Have you really — was it by your desire ? I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered . Did Admiral Crawford apply ? How was it ? I am stupefied . ”
118470	118495	118467	118467	he	128	“ How kind ! how very kind ! Oh , Mr. Crawford , we are infinitely obliged to you ! Dearest , dearest William ! ”
118510	118529	118496	118496	She	2372	“ I will go to my uncle . My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible . ”
118555	118569	118571	118571	he	128	“ She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ”
118829	118870	118817	118817	she	2372	“ Do n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t ! I beg you would not . This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me . I must go away . I can not bear it . ”
118954	118961	118962	118962	she	2372	“ No , no , no ! ”
118969	119046	118962	118962	she	2372	“ This is all nonsense . Do not distress me . I can hear no more of this . Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such — No , no , do n’t think of me . But you are not thinking of me . I know it is all nothing . ”
119713	119836	119695	119696	her aunt	446	“ MY DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at Miss Price for at least the last six weeks — I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval . Go on , my dear Fanny , and without fear ; there can be no difficulties worth naming . I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something ; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon , and send him back to me even happier than he goes . Yours affectionately , M. C. ”
120167	120336	120145	120146	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Now William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in her presents too . She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for her , with her limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin . She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it . ”
120337	120347	120349	120350	Lady Bertram	103	“ I am glad you gave him something considerable , ”
120357	120366	120349	120350	Lady Bertram	103	“ for I gave him only £ 10 . ”
120367	120370	120372	120373	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Indeed ! ”
120377	120404	120372	120373	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Upon my word , he must have gone off with his pockets well lined , and at no expense for his journey to London either ! ”
120405	120416	120417	120418	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Sir Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ”
120439	120444	120446	120446	she	102	“ It is amazing , ”
120448	120541	120446	120446	she	102	“ how much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world ! They little think how much it comes to , or what their parents , or their uncles and aunts , pay for them in the course of the year . Now , here are my sister Price ’s children ; take them all together , I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year , to say nothing of what I do for them . ”
120542	120633	120634	120634	Fanny	111	“ Very true , sister , as you say . But , poor things ! they can not help it ; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas . Fanny , William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies ; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having . I wish he may go to the East Indies , that I may have my shawl . I think I will have two shawls , Fanny . ”
121054	121092	121043	121043	his	2404	“ Have you nothing to send to Mary ? No answer to her note ? She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you . Pray write to her , if it be only a line . ”
121093	121099	121101	121101	Fanny	111	“ Oh yes ! certainly , ”
121116	121121	121043	121043	his	2404	away—“I will write directly . ”
121245	121386	121232	121232	she	2403	“ I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William . The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently . I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again . With thanks for the honour of your note , I remain , dear Miss Crawford , & c. , & c. ”
121415	121426	121428	121428	he	130	“ You can not think I mean to hurry you , ”
121446	121465	121428	121428	he	130	“ you can not think I have any such object . Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . ”
121466	121511	121428	121428	he	130	“ Oh ! I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give that to Miss Crawford . ”
122174	122184	122160	122160	he	299	“ Why have you no fire to - day ? ”
122203	122222	122200	122200	She	2420	“ I am not cold , sir : I never sit here long at this time of year . ”
122223	122232	122160	122160	he	299	“ But you have a fire in general ? ”
122233	122238	122160	122160	he	299	“ No , sir . ”
122239	122331	122200	122200	She	2420	“ How comes this about ? Here must be some mistake . I understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable . In your bedchamber I know you can not have a fire . Here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified . It is highly unfit for you to sit , be it only half an hour a day , without a fire . You are not strong . You are chilly . Your aunt can not be aware of this . ”
122366	122370	122160	122160	he	299	“ my aunt Norris ”
122374	122378	122384	122384	himself	299	“ I understand , ”
122393	122710	122384	122384	himself	299	“ I understand . Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate , and very judiciously , for young people ’s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences ; but there should be moderation in everything . She is also very hardy herself , which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others . And on another account , too , I can perfectly comprehend . I know what her sentiments have always been . The principle was good in itself , but it may have been , and I believe has been , carried too far in your case . I am aware that there has been sometimes , in some points , a misplaced distinction ; but I think too well of you , Fanny , to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account . You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part , and judging partially by the event . You will take in the whole of the past , you will consider times , persons , and probabilities , and you will feel that they were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which seemed to be your lot . Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary , it was kindly meant ; and of this you may be assured , that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed . I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you , by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attention that are due to her . But enough of this . Sit down , my dear . I must speak to you for a few minutes , but I will not detain you long . ”
122740	122784	122728	122729	Sir Thomas	98	“ You are not aware , perhaps , that I have had a visitor this morning . I had not been long in my own room , after breakfast , when Mr. Crawford was shewn in . His errand you may probably conjecture . ”
123048	123147	123045	123045	he	98	“ And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to . Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house . He is in my room , and hoping to see you there . ”
123177	123251	123170	123170	his	98	exclaim—“Oh ! no , sir , I can not , indeed I can not go down to him . Mr. Crawford ought to know — he must know that : I told him enough yesterday to convince him ; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday , and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me , and quite out of my power to return his good opinion . ”
123252	123260	123262	123263	Sir Thomas	98	“ I do not catch your meaning , ”
123269	123368	123262	123263	Sir Thomas	98	“ Out of your power to return his good opinion ? What is all this ? I know he spoke to you yesterday , and ( as far as I understand ) received as much encouragement to proceed as a well - judging young woman could permit herself to give . I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion ; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended . But now , when he has made his overtures so properly , and honourably — what are your scruples now ? ”
123369	123376	123378	123378	Fanny	111	“ You are mistaken , sir , ”
123397	123541	123542	123542	She	2450	“ you are quite mistaken . How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing ? I gave him no encouragement yesterday . On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again . I am sure I said as much as that and more ; and I should have said still more , if I had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously ; but I did not like to be , I could not bear to be , imputing more than might be intended . I thought it might all pass for nothing with him . ”
123554	123560	123562	123563	Sir Thomas	98	“ Am I to understand , ”
123572	123581	123562	123563	Sir Thomas	98	“ that you mean to refuse Mr. Crawford ? ”
123582	123587	123562	123563	Sir Thomas	98	“ Yes , sir . ”
123588	123592	123562	123563	Sir Thomas	98	“ Refuse him ? ”
123593	123598	123562	123563	Sir Thomas	98	“ Yes , sir . ”
123599	123612	123562	123563	Sir Thomas	98	“ Refuse Mr. Crawford ! Upon what plea ? For what reason ? ”
123613	123630	123562	123563	Sir Thomas	98	“ I — I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ”
123631	123637	123639	123640	Sir Thomas	98	“ This is very strange ! ”
123649	123784	123639	123640	Sir Thomas	98	“ There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach . Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you , with everything to recommend him : not merely situation in life , fortune , and character , but with more than common agreeableness , with address and conversation pleasing to everybody . And he is not an acquaintance of to - day ; you have now known him some time . His sister , moreover , is your intimate friend , and he has been doing that for your brother , which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you , had there been no other . It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on . He has done it already . ”
123785	123788	123790	123790	Fanny	111	“ Yes , ”
123829	123836	123838	123839	Sir Thomas	98	“ You must have been aware , ”
123842	123926	123838	123839	Sir Thomas	98	“ you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford ’s manners to you . This can not have taken you by surprise . You must have observed his attentions ; and though you always received them very properly ( I have no accusation to make on that head ) , I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you . I am half inclined to think , Fanny , that you do not quite know your own feelings . ”
123927	123948	123949	123950	Sir Thomas	98	“ Oh yes , sir ! indeed I do . His attentions were always — what I did not like . ”
123958	123964	123966	123966	he	98	“ This is beyond me , ”
123968	123993	123966	123966	he	98	“ This requires explanation . Young as you are , and having seen scarcely any one , it is hardly possible that your affections — ”
124052	124080	124048	124048	he	98	“ No , no , I know that is quite out of the question ; quite impossible . Well , there is nothing more to be said . ”
124140	124153	124155	124156	Sir Thomas	98	“ Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford ’s choice seemed to justify ”
124165	124281	124155	124156	Sir Thomas	98	“ his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me . I am an advocate for early marriages , where there are means in proportion , and would have every young man , with a sufficient income , settle as soon after four - and - twenty as he can . This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . I wish he were more likely to fix . ”
124289	124354	124155	124156	Sir Thomas	98	“ Edmund , I consider , from his dispositions and habits , as much more likely to marry early than his brother . He , indeed , I have lately thought , has seen the woman he could love , which , I am convinced , my eldest son has not . Am I right ? Do you agree with me , my dear ? ”
124355	124360	124155	124156	Sir Thomas	98	“ Yes , sir . ”
124445	124462	124432	124432	he	98	“ Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford ’s temper ? ”
124463	124468	124469	124469	She	702	“ No , sir . ”
124474	124481	124469	124469	She	702	“ But of his principles I have ”
124635	125144	124611	124612	Sir Thomas	98	“ It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you . We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference . Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting . I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed . For I had , Fanny , as I think my behaviour must have shewn , formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England . I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper , self - conceit , and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days , even in young women , and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence . But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . The advantage or disadvantage of your family , of your parents , your brothers and sisters , never seems to have had a moment ’s share in your thoughts on this occasion . How they might be benefited , how they must rejoice in such an establishment for you , is nothing to you . You think only of yourself , and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford ’s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia ’s hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria ’s to Mr. Rushworth . ”
125152	125275	125276	125276	He	2463	“ And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters , on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only half the eligibility of this , immediately and peremptorily , and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation , put a decided negative on it . I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding . I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect . You are not to be judged by the same rule . You do not owe me the duty of a child . But , Fanny , if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude — ”
125371	125377	125379	125379	she	2464	“ I am very sorry , ”
125386	125393	125379	125379	she	2464	“ I am very sorry indeed . ”
125394	125421	125379	125379	she	2464	“ Sorry ! yes , I hope you are sorry ; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day ’s transactions . ”
125422	125432	125434	125434	she	2464	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ”
125441	125464	125434	125434	she	2464	“ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ”
125627	125630	125632	125632	he	98	“ Well , ”
125646	125741	125632	125632	he	98	“ well , child , dry up your tears . There is no use in these tears ; they can do no good . You must now come downstairs with me . Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already . You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments , which , unfortunately for himself , he certainly has imbibed . I am totally unequal to it . ”
126080	126184	126076	126076	he	299	“ Mr. Crawford is gone : he has just left me . I need not repeat what has passed . I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling , by an account of what he has felt . Suffice it , that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner , and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding , heart , and temper . Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . ”
126197	126201	126203	126204	her uncle	299	“ Of course , ”
126206	126365	126203	126204	her uncle	299	“ it can not be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone , be it only for five minutes ; a request too natural , a claim too just to be denied . But there is no time fixed ; perhaps to - morrow , or whenever your spirits are composed enough . For the present you have only to tranquillise yourself . Check these tears ; they do but exhaust you . If , as I am willing to suppose , you wish to shew me any observance , you will not give way to these emotions , but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind . I advise you to go out : the air will do you good ; go out for an hour on the gravel ; you will have the shrubbery to yourself , and will be the better for air and exercise . And , Fanny ”
126375	126411	126203	126204	her uncle	299	“ I shall make no mention below of what has passed ; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram . There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment ; say nothing about it yourself . ”
126702	126718	126720	126720	she	2480	“ I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! ”
126725	126733	126720	126720	she	2480	“ Heaven defend me from being ungrateful ! ”
126859	126888	126890	126890	she	2480	“ If I had known you were going out , I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny , ”
126892	126972	126890	126890	she	2480	“ which I have since , to my very great inconvenience , been obliged to go and carry myself . I could very ill spare the time , and you might have saved me the trouble , if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out . It would have made no difference to you , I suppose , whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house . ”
126973	126985	126987	126988	Sir Thomas	98	“ I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place , ”
126990	126993	126995	126996	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Oh ! ”
127004	127149	126995	126996	Mrs. Norris	102	“ that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house . Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault . If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about Fanny , I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ”
127561	127577	127546	127547	the butler	4822	“ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”
127619	127663	127614	127615	Mrs. Norris	102	“ Stay , stay , Fanny ! what are you about ? where are you going ? do n’t be in such a hurry . Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ”
127671	127725	127614	127615	Mrs. Norris	102	“ but you are so very eager to put yourself forward . What should Sir Thomas want you for ? It is me , Baddeley , you mean ; I am coming this moment . You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ”
127731	127750	127727	127727	Baddeley	215	“ No , ma’am , it is Miss Price ; I am certain of its being Miss Price . ”
127765	127778	127727	127727	Baddeley	215	“ I do not think you would answer the purpose at all . ”
129533	129683	129512	129513	Sir Thomas	98	“ Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you . He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event , you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement . With him it is entirely a matter of feeling : he claims no merit in it ; perhaps is entitled to none . Yet , having chosen so well , his constancy has a respectable stamp . Had his choice been less unexceptionable , I should have condemned his persevering . ”
129684	129689	129691	129691	Fanny	111	“ Indeed , sir , ”
129693	129747	129691	129691	Fanny	111	“ I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I have told him so , that it never will be in my power — ”
129748	129752	129754	129755	Sir Thomas	98	“ My dear , ”
129757	129978	129754	129755	Sir Thomas	98	“ there is no occasion for this . Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you . There is nothing more to be said or done . From this hour the subject is never to be revived between us . You will have nothing to fear , or to be agitated about . You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations . Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his . He proceeds at his own risk . You are on safe ground . I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant . He leaves Northamptonshire so soon , that even this slight sacrifice can not be often demanded . The future must be very uncertain . And now , my dear Fanny , this subject is closed between us . ”
130619	130624	130626	130626	she	103	“ Well , Fanny , ”
130663	130710	130652	130652	her	103	“ Well , Fanny , I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning . I must just speak of it once , I told Sir Thomas I must once , and then I shall have done . I give you joy , my dear niece . ”
130720	130730	130717	130717	she	103	“ Humph , we certainly are a handsome family ! ”
130757	130812	130753	130753	she	103	“ My dear aunt , you can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure . You can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ? Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ”
130813	130887	130753	130753	she	103	“ No , my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way . I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford . And you must be aware , Fanny , that it is every young woman ’s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this . ”
130957	130966	130968	130968	she	103	“ I will tell you what , Fanny , ”
130970	131046	130968	130968	she	103	“ I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening . You did look remarkably well . Everybody said so . Sir Thomas said so . And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress . I am very glad I sent Chapman to you . I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . ”
131060	131092	131055	131055	she	103	“ And I will tell you what , Fanny , which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy . ”
132129	132140	132142	132143	his mother	607	“ We have not been so silent all the time , ”
132145	132164	132142	132143	his mother	607	“ Fanny has been reading to me , and only put the book down upon hearing you coming . ”
132190	132227	132228	132228	Crawford	125	“ She often reads to me out of those books ; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man’s — what ’s his name , Fanny?—when we heard your footsteps . ”
132233	132247	132249	132249	he	105	“ Let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship , ”
132251	132258	132249	132249	he	105	“ I shall find it immediately . ”
132728	132738	132740	132740	he	105	“ That play must be a favourite with you , ”
132742	132752	132740	132740	he	105	“ you read as if you knew it well . ”
132753	132767	132769	132769	Crawford	125	“ It will be a favourite , I believe , from this hour , ”
132771	132886	132769	132769	Crawford	125	“ but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen . I once saw Henry the Eighth acted , or I have heard of it from somebody who did , I am not certain which . But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how . It is a part of an Englishman ’s constitution . His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere ; one is intimate with him by instinct . No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately . ”
132887	132899	132901	132901	Edmund	105	“ No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , ”
132903	132991	132901	132901	Edmund	105	“ from one ’s earliest years . His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody ; they are in half the books we open , and we all talk Shakespeare , use his similes , and describe with his descriptions ; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it . To know him in bits and scraps is common enough ; to know him pretty thoroughly is , perhaps , not uncommon ; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent . ”
132992	133000	133002	133002	Crawford	125	“ Sir , you do me honour , ”
133069	133079	133081	133081	she	103	“ It was really like being at a play , ”
133083	133092	133081	133081	she	103	“ I wish Sir Thomas had been here . ”
133133	133149	133151	133152	her ladyship	902	“ You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , ”
133156	133209	133151	133152	her ladyship	902	“ and I will tell you what , I think you will have a theatre , some time or other , at your house in Norfolk . I mean when you are settled there . I do indeed . I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk . ”
133210	133216	133218	133218	he	2579	“ Do you , ma’am ? ”
133223	133247	133218	133218	he	2579	“ No , no , that will never be . Your ladyship is quite mistaken . No theatre at Everingham ! Oh no ! ”
133262	133273	133249	133249	he	2579	“ That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham . ”
133482	133488	133490	133490	Edmund	105	“ Even in my profession , ”
133496	133651	133490	133490	Edmund	105	“ how little the art of reading has been studied ! how little a clear manner , and good delivery , have been attended to ! I speak rather of the past , however , than the present . There is now a spirit of improvement abroad ; but among those who were ordained twenty , thirty , forty years ago , the larger number , to judge by their performance , must have thought reading was reading , and preaching was preaching . It is different now . The subject is more justly considered . It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths ; and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise . ”
133845	133849	133851	133851	Crawford	125	“ Our liturgy , ”
133853	133905	133851	133851	Crawford	125	“ has beauties , which not even a careless , slovenly style of reading can destroy ; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt . For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be ”
133915	133947	133851	133851	Crawford	125	“ that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . Did you speak ? ”
133965	133968	133969	133969	he	105	“ No , ”
133972	134020	133969	133969	he	105	“ Are you sure you did not speak ? I saw your lips move . I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive , and not allow my thoughts to wander . Are not you going to tell me so ? ”
134021	134039	134040	134040	She	2586	“ No , indeed , you know your duty too well for me to — even supposing — ”
134093	134295	134296	134296	Edmund	105	“ A sermon , well delivered , is more uncommon even than prayers well read . A sermon , good in itself , is no rare thing . It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well ; that is , the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study . A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect , and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself . There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers , on subjects limited , and long worn threadbare in all common hands ; who can say anything new or striking , anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste , or wearing out the feelings of his hearers , is a man whom one could not , in his public capacity , honour enough . I should like to be such a man . ”
134299	134400	134296	134296	Edmund	105	“ I should indeed . I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy . But then , I must have a London audience . I could not preach but to the educated ; to those who were capable of estimating my composition . And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . ”

134630	134640	134642	134642	he	130	“ What did that shake of the head mean ? ”
134644	134731	134642	134642	he	130	“ What was it meant to express ? Disapprobation , I fear . But of what ? What had I been saying to displease you ? Did you think me speaking improperly , lightly , irreverently on the subject ? Only tell me if I was . Only tell me if I was wrong . I want to be set right . Nay , nay , I entreat you ; for one moment put down your work . What did that shake of the head mean ? ”
134736	134749	134735	134735	her	2589	“ Pray , sir , do n’t ; pray , Mr. Crawford , ”
134796	134814	134789	134789	She	2589	“ How can you , sir ? You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can — ”
134815	134821	134823	134823	he	130	“ Do I astonish you ? ”
134825	134887	134823	134823	he	130	“ Do you wonder ? Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ? I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . I will not leave you to wonder long . ”
134906	134976	134823	134823	he	130	“ You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy . Yes , that was the word . Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . I would spell it , read it , write it with anybody . I see nothing alarming in the word . Did you think I ought ? ”
134977	134982	134984	134984	Fanny	111	“ Perhaps , sir , ”
134990	135017	135018	135018	Crawford	125	speaking—“perhaps , sir , I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment . ”
135158	135161	135163	135163	Crawford	125	“ Well , ”
135175	135463	135163	135163	Crawford	125	“ I am happier than I was , because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me . You think me unsteady : easily swayed by the whim of the moment , easily tempted , easily put aside . With such an opinion , no wonder that — But we shall see.—It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged ; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady . My conduct shall speak for me ; absence , distance , time shall speak for me . They shall prove that , as far as you can be deserved by anybody , I do deserve you . You are infinitely my superior in merit ; all that I know . You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature . You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what — not merely beyond what one sees , because one never sees anything like it — but beyond what one fancies might be . But still I am not frightened . It is not by equality of merit that you can be won . That is out of the question . It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest , who loves you most devotedly , that has the best right to a return . There I build my confidence . By that right I do and will deserve you ; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it , I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes . Yes , dearest , sweetest Fanny . Nay ”
135472	135548	135163	135163	Crawford	125	“ forgive me . Perhaps I have as yet no right ; but by what other name can I call you ? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other ? No , it is ‘ Fanny ’ that I think of all day , and dream of all night . You have given the name such reality of sweetness , that nothing else can now be descriptive of you . ”
136048	136069	136098	136098	he	105	“ I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , ”
136103	136114	136116	136116	he	105	“ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ”
136118	136122	136116	136116	he	105	“ Shall I ? ”
136129	136144	136145	136145	She	307	“ It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together . ”
136161	136166	136167	136167	he	105	“ But , Fanny , ”
136171	136233	136167	136167	he	105	“ in order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together . You must talk to me . I know you have something on your mind . I know what you are thinking of . You can not suppose me uninformed . Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ? ”
136244	136264	136234	136234	Fanny	111	“ If you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . ”
136265	136319	136167	136167	he	105	“ Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them . I do not mean to press you , however . If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done . I had thought it might be a relief . ”
136320	136341	136234	136234	Fanny	111	“ I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . ”
136342	136452	136234	136234	Fanny	111	“ Do you suppose that we think differently ? I have no idea of it . I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him . Can there be any disagreement between us here ? ”
136453	136477	136167	136167	he	105	“ Oh no ! But I thought you blamed me . I thought you were against me . This is such a comfort ! ”
136478	136539	136234	136234	Fanny	111	“ This comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it . But how could you possibly suppose me against you ? How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ? Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ”
136540	136557	136234	136234	Fanny	111	“ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ”
136558	136635	136167	136167	he	105	“ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly that , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right . Can it admit of a question ? It is disgraceful to us if it does . You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . ”
136647	136713	136636	136636	Fanny	111	“ So far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise . But the matter does not end here . Crawford ’s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before . This , we know , must be a work of time . But ”
136720	136771	136790	136790	she	2605	“ let him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last . You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . ”
136772	136788	136790	136790	she	2605	“ Oh ! never , never , never ! he never will succeed with me . ”
136821	136840	136818	136818	him	105	“ Never ! Fanny!—so very determined and positive ! This is not like yourself , your rational self . ”
136841	136845	136846	136846	she	2605	“ I mean , ”
136853	136880	136846	136846	she	2605	“ that I think I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . ”
136881	137140	136818	136818	him	105	“ I must hope better things . I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation . I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him . I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for . I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny . Between us , I think we should have won you . My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed . He should have worked upon my plans . I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward . I can not suppose that you have not the wish to love him — the natural wish of gratitude . You must have some feeling of that sort . You must be sorry for your own indifference . ”
137141	137148	137150	137150	Fanny	111	“ We are so totally unlike , ”
137157	137215	137150	137150	Fanny	111	“ we are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I could like him . There never were two people more dissimilar . We have not one taste in common . We should be miserable . ”
137216	137514	137518	137518	Fanny	111	“ You are mistaken , Fanny . The dissimilarity is not so strong . You are quite enough alike . You have tastes in common . You have moral and literary tastes in common . You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings ; and , Fanny , who that heard him read , and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night , will think you unfitted as companions ? You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow . He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours . It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are . His cheerfulness will counteract this . He sees difficulties nowhere : and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you . Your being so far unlike , Fanny , does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together : do not imagine it . I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance . I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike : I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits , in the manners , in the inclination for much or little company , in the propensity to talk or to be silent , to be grave or to be gay . Some opposition here is , I am thoroughly convinced , friendly to matrimonial happiness . I exclude extremes , of course ; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme . A counteraction , gentle and continual , is the best safeguard of manners and conduct . ”
137596	137758	137590	137591	Mr. Crawford	130	“ It is not merely in temper that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in that respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character . I have not thought well of him from the time of the play . I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over . ”
137759	137764	137766	137766	Edmund	105	“ My dear Fanny , ”
137775	137852	137766	137766	Edmund	105	“ let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly . The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect . Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself . Compared with me , all the rest were blameless . I was playing the fool with my eyes open . ”
137853	137858	137860	137860	Fanny	111	“ As a bystander , ”
137862	137883	137860	137860	Fanny	111	“ perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . ”
137884	137933	137766	137766	Edmund	105	“ Very possibly . No wonder . Nothing could be more improper than the whole business . I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . ”
137934	137954	137766	137766	Edmund	105	“ Before the play , I am much mistaken if Julia did not think he was paying her attentions . ”
137955	138170	137860	137860	Fanny	111	“ Julia ! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it . And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters ’ good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent . I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to — there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you . And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion . It does him the highest honour ; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment . It proves him unspoilt by his uncle . It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not . ”
138171	138189	137766	137766	Edmund	105	“ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ”
138190	138362	137766	137766	Edmund	105	“ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . How could it be otherwise , with such an education and adviser ? Under the disadvantages , indeed , which both have had , is it not wonderful that they should be what they are ? Crawford ’s feelings , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides . Happily , those feelings have generally been good . You will supply the rest ; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature — to a woman who , firm as a rock in her own principles , has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them . He has chosen his partner , indeed , with rare felicity . He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything . ”
138363	138373	138375	138375	Fanny	111	“ I would not engage in such a charge , ”
138382	138391	138375	138375	Fanny	111	“ in such an office of high responsibility ! ”
138392	138482	138483	138483	Fanny	111	“ As usual , believing yourself unequal to anything ! fancying everything too much for you ! Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may . I have no common interest in Crawford ’s well - doing . Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me . You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford . ”
138515	138719	138510	138510	Edmund	105	“ I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light . I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . But it was very different . She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . We had a long talk about it . I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ”
138720	138730	138483	138483	Fanny	111	“ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ”
138731	138772	138483	138483	Fanny	111	“ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . ”
138773	138785	138510	138510	Edmund	105	“ It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ”
138786	138892	138483	138483	Fanny	111	“ Yes , she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best . You will see her , however , before she goes . She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that . She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . It is the regret and disappointment of a sister , who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for , at the first moment . She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . ”
138893	138904	138483	138483	Fanny	111	“ I knew she would be very angry with me . ”
138905	138910	138912	138912	Edmund	105	“ My dearest Fanny , ”
138921	139020	138912	138912	Edmund	105	“ do not let the idea of her anger distress you . It is anger to be talked of rather than felt . Her heart is made for love and kindness , not for resentment . I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you should be Henry ’s wife . And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality . ”
139021	139041	138483	138483	Fanny	111	“ And Mrs. Grant , did she say — did she speak ; was she there all the time ? ”
139042	139145	138483	138483	Fanny	111	“ Yes , she was agreeing exactly with her sister . The surprise of your refusal , Fanny , seems to have been unbounded . That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand . I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case — you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them . But this is teasing you . I have done . Do not turn away from me . ”
139146	139152	139154	139154	Fanny	111	“ I should have thought , ”
139164	139473	139154	139154	Fanny	111	“ that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man ’s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable . Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself . But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? He took me wholly by surprise . I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford . I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . How , then , was I to be — to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ? His sisters should consider me as well as him . The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . And , and — we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . ”
139474	139700	139701	139701	Fanny	111	“ My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth . I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings . I had attributed them to you before . I thought I could understand you . You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him . Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years ’ happy marriage . ”
139831	139907	139828	139828	he	105	observed—“They go on Monday . You are sure , therefore , of seeing your friend either to - morrow or Sunday . They really go on Monday ; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day ! I had almost promised it . What a difference it might have made ! Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life . ”
139908	139915	140132	140132	he	2613	“ You were near staying there ? ”
139916	139978	140132	140132	he	2613	“ Very . I was most kindly pressed , and had nearly consented . Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . ”
139979	139987	139828	139828	he	105	“ You spent your time pleasantly there ? ”
139988	140041	140132	140132	he	2613	“ Yes ; that is , it was the fault of my own mind if I did not . They were all very pleasant . I doubt their finding me so . I took uneasiness with me , and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again . ”
140042	140055	140132	140132	he	2613	“ The Miss Owens — you liked them , did not you ? ”
140056	140121	139828	139828	he	105	“ Yes , very well . Pleasant , good - humoured , unaffected girls . But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society . Good - humoured , unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . They are two distinct orders of being . You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ”
140436	140440	140442	140442	Edmund	105	“ her friend , ”
140677	140688	140656	140656	She	125	“ I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere ”
140802	140820	140794	140794	She	125	“ Sad , sad girl ! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you , ”
140933	140936	140937	140937	she	2614	“ Ha ! ”
140944	140962	140937	140937	she	2614	“ am I here again ? The East room ! Once only was I in this room before ”
140985	141064	140982	140982	she	2614	“ Once only before . Do you remember it ? I came to rehearse . Your cousin came too ; and we had a rehearsal . You were our audience and prompter . A delightful rehearsal . I shall never forget it . Here we were , just in this part of the room : here was your cousin , here was I , here were the chairs . Oh ! why will such things ever pass away ? ”
141092	141368	141083	141083	She	2614	“ The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable ! The subject of it so very — very — what shall I say ? He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me . I think I see him now , trying to be as demure and composed as Anhalt ought , through the two long speeches . ‘ When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state , matrimony may be called a happy life . ’ I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words . It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week — that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be that ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression . But alas , that very evening destroyed it all . That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle . Poor Sir Thomas , who was glad to see you ? Yet , Fanny , do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas , though I certainly did hate him for many a week . No , I do him justice now . He is just what the head of such a family should be . Nay , in sober sadness , I believe I now love you all . ”
141407	141426	141428	141428	she	2635	“ I have had a little fit since I came into this room , as you may perceive , ”
141436	141482	141428	141428	she	2635	“ but it is over now ; so let us sit down and be comfortable ; for as to scolding you , Fanny , which I came fully intending to do , I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point . ”
141489	141527	141428	141428	she	2635	“ Good , gentle Fanny ! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . ”
141552	141555	141556	141556	She	2635	“ last . ”
141594	141651	141572	141573	Miss Crawford	125	“ I hate to leave you . I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going . Who says we shall not be sisters ? I know we shall . I feel that we are born to be connected ; and those tears convince me that you feel it too , dear Fanny . ”
141664	141687	141654	141654	herself	111	“ But you are only going from one set of friends to another . You are going to a very particular friend . ”
141688	141857	141892	141892	She	129	“ Yes , very true . Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years . But I have not the least inclination to go near her . I can think only of the friends I am leaving : my excellent sister , yourself , and the Bertrams in general . You have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large . You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you , which in common intercourse one knows nothing of . I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter , a much better time for the visit , but now I can not put her off . And when I have done with her I must go to her sister , Lady Stornaway , because she was rather my most particular friend of the two , but I have not cared much for her these three years . ”
141897	141997	141892	141892	She	129	“ How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs , and setting off to find my way to the East room , without having an idea whereabouts it was ! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along , and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work ; and then your cousin ’s astonishment , when he opened the door , at seeing me here ! To be sure , your uncle ’s returning that very evening ! There never was anything quite like it . ”
142017	142834	142011	142011	she	129	“ Why , Fanny , you are absolutely in a reverie . Thinking , I hope , of one who is always thinking of you . Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend ’s sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill - tempered and exigeant , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five - and - twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill - bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there is attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . I had my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . ”
142861	142988	142011	142011	she	129	“ Excellent creature ! I will not tease you . Everything shall take its course . But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies . It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be . You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . Was not he devoted to you at the ball ? And then before the ball , the necklace ! Oh ! you received it just as it was meant . You were as conscious as heart could desire . I remember it perfectly . ”
142989	143015	142011	142011	she	129	“ Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ? Oh ! Miss Crawford , that was not fair . ”
143016	143059	142011	142011	she	129	“ Knew of it ! It was his own doing entirely , his own thought . I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . ”
143060	143066	143068	143068	Fanny	111	“ I will not say , ”
143070	143269	143068	143068	Fanny	111	“ that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was . It is as true as that I sit here . And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . As to your brother ’s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind . I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ”
143270	143395	143398	143398	her	2639	“ Ah ! I can not deny it . He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ’ affections . I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one ’s power to pay off the debts of one ’s sex ! Oh ! I am sure it is not in woman ’s nature to refuse such a triumph . ”
143401	143437	143396	143396	Fanny	111	“ I can not think well of a man who sports with any woman ’s feelings ; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander - by can judge of . ”
143438	143586	143587	143587	Fanny	111	“ I do not defend him . I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife ’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . ”
143601	143613	143615	143615	Mary	129	“ I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ”
143618	143631	143632	143632	She	129	“ than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ”
143644	143657	143632	143632	She	129	“ Oh ! yes . How very , very kind of him . ”
143658	143737	143738	143739	Poor Fanny	111	“ I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move . The Admiral hates trouble , and scorns asking favours ; and there are so many young men ’s claims to be attended to in the same way , that a friendship and energy , not very determined , is easily put by . What a happy creature William must be ! I wish we could see him . ”
143807	143906	143783	143783	Mary	129	“ I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here . And I do take leave , longing for a happy reunion , and trusting that when we meet again , it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve . ”
143924	144025	143783	143783	Mary	129	“ I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you . I have two favours to ask , Fanny : one is your correspondence . You must write to me . And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone . ”
145481	145487	145495	145496	Sir Thomas	98	“ then so it shall be ”
146503	146510	146513	146514	Lady Bertram	103	“ That may be , sister , ”
146518	146538	146513	146514	Lady Bertram	103	“ I dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . ”
146616	146618	146632	146632	she	103	“ mama ”
146861	146870	146872	146872	he	229	“ I do not know how it is , ”
146874	146958	146872	146872	he	229	“ but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father ’s . The house is always in confusion . You will set things going in a better way , I am sure . You will tell my mother how it all ought to be , and you will be so useful to Susan , and you will teach Betsey , and make the boys love and mind you . How right and comfortable it will all be ! ”
147633	147676	147620	147620	Edmund	105	“ And I shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . ”
148775	148797	148798	148798	She	2776	“ The Thrush is gone out of harbour , please sir , and one of the officers has been here to — ”
148838	148934	148833	148833	himself	229	“ You are just in time . We have been looking for you this half - hour . The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . I saw her . It was a beautiful sight . And they think she will have her orders in a day or two . And Mr. Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you : he has got one of the Thrush ’s boats , and is going off to her at six , and hoped you would be here in time to go with him . ”
149235	149367	149368	149369	Her son	615	“ Oh ! my dear William , how glad I am to see you . But have you heard about the Thrush ? She is gone out of harbour already ; three days before we had any thought of it ; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam ’s things , they will never be ready in time ; for she may have her orders to - morrow , perhaps . It takes me quite unawares . And now you must be off for Spithead too . Campbell has been here , quite in a worry about you ; and now what shall we do ? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you , and here everything comes upon me at once . ”
149399	149498	149505	149506	Mrs. Price	104	“ To be sure , I had much rather she had stayed in harbour , that I might have sat a few hours with you in comfort ; but as there is a boat ashore , I had better go off at once , and there is no help for it . Whereabouts does the Thrush lay at Spithead ? Near the Canopus ? But no matter ; here ’s Fanny in the parlour , and why should we stay in the passage ? Come , mother , you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet . ”
149537	149689	149690	149690	They	2799	“ Poor dears ! how tired you must both be ! and now , what will you have ? I began to think you would never come . Betsey and I have been watching for you this half - hour . And when did you get anything to eat ? And what would you like to have now ? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea , after your journey , or else I would have got something ready . And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak , and we have no butcher at hand . It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street . We were better off in our last house . Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got . ”
149700	149756	149757	149757	Betsey	146	“ Then , Betsey , my dear , run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on ; and tell her to bring in the tea - things as soon as she can . I wish we could get the bell mended ; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger . ”
149773	149777	149779	149781	the anxious mother	2801	“ Dear me ! ”
149783	149847	149779	149781	the anxious mother	2801	“ what a sad fire we have got , and I dare say you are both starved with cold . Draw your chair nearer , my dear . I can not think what Rebecca has been about . I am sure I told her to bring some coals half an hour ago . Susan , you should have taken care of the fire . ”
149848	149859	149861	149861	Susan	261	“ I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , ”
149876	149908	149861	149861	Susan	261	“ You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room ; and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help . ”
150058	150393	150056	150056	he	229	began—“Ha ! welcome back , my boy . Glad to see you . Have you heard the news ? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . Sharp is the word , you see ! By G — , you are just in time ! The doctor has been here inquiring for you : he has got one of the boats , and is to be off for Spithead by six , so you had better go with him . I have been to Turner ’s about your mess ; it is all in a way to be done . I should not wonder if you had your orders to - morrow : but you can not sail with this wind , if you are to cruise to the westward ; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward , with the Elephant . By G — , I wish you may ! But old Scholey was saying , just now , that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel . Well , well , we are ready , whatever happens . But by G — , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour ! I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds . Old Scholey ran in at breakfast - time , to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out , I jumped up , and made but two steps to the platform . If ever there was a perfect beauty afloat , she is one ; and there she lays at Spithead , and anybody in England would take her for an eight - and - twenty . I was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her . She lays close to the Endymion , between her and the Cleopatra , just to the eastward of the sheer hulk . ”
150394	150397	150399	150399	William	229	“ Ha ! ”
150401	150433	150399	150399	William	229	“ that ’s just where I should have put her myself . It ’s the best berth at Spithead . But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , ”
150440	150451	150399	150399	William	229	“ it is so dark you do not see her . ”
151493	151544	151490	151490	he	645	“ Devil take those young dogs ! How they are singing out ! Ay , Sam ’s voice louder than all the rest ! That boy is fit for a boatswain . Holla , you there ! Sam , stop your confounded pipe , or I shall be after you . ”
151736	151744	151745	151745	she	261	“ She had been into the kitchen , ”
151748	151790	151745	151745	she	261	“ to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey . ”
152341	152350	152300	152301	the mother	3962	earliest—“How did sister Bertram manage about her servants ? ”
152351	152362	152300	152301	the mother	3962	“ Was she as much plagued as herself to get tolerable servants?”—soon
152466	152470	152472	152473	Mrs. Price	104	“ Her year ! ”
152475	152601	152472	152473	Mrs. Price	104	“ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . Servants are come to such a pass , my dear , in Portsmouth , that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year . I have no hope of ever being settled ; and if I was to part with Rebecca , I should only get something worse . And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , for there is always a girl under her , and I often do half the work myself . ”
152777	152787	152789	152789	Fanny	111	“ What have you got there , my love ? ”
152791	152799	152789	152789	Fanny	111	“ come and shew it to me . ”
152855	152954	152840	152840	she	261	“ It was very hard that she was not to have her own knife ; it was her own knife ; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed , and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago . But mama kept it from her , and was always letting Betsey get hold of it ; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it , and get it for her own , though mama had promised her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands . ”
152982	152987	152989	152990	Mrs. Price	104	“ Now , Susan , ”
152997	153218	152989	152990	Mrs. Price	104	“ now , how can you be so cross ? You are always quarrelling about that knife . I wish you would not be so quarrelsome . Poor little Betsey ; how cross Susan is to you ! But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer . You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it . I must hide it another time , Betsey . Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died . Poor little soul ! she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried . ’ Poor little dear ! she was so fond of it , Fanny , that she would have it lay by her in bed , all through her illness . It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death . Poor little sweet creature ! Well , she was taken away from evil to come . My own Betsey ”
153224	153251	152989	152990	Mrs. Price	104	“ you have not the luck of such a good godmother . Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you . ”
153819	153852	153809	153809	He	229	“ Take care of Fanny , mother . She is tender , and not used to rough it like the rest of us . I charge you , take care of Fanny . ”
155543	155551	155552	155552	she	146	“ And now that I have begun , ”
155555	156181	155552	155552	she	146	“ my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines passionnées from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at the same time that you were . But there he is , and , by the bye , his absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister ’s in writing , for there has been no ‘ Well , Mary , when do you write to Fanny ? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny ? ’ to spur me on . At last , after various attempts at meeting , I have seen your cousins , ‘ dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth ’ ; they found me at home yesterday , and we were glad to see each other again . We seemed very glad to see each other , and I do really think we were a little . We had a vast deal to say . Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned ? I did not use to think her wanting in self - possession , but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday . Upon the whole , Julia was in the best looks of the two , at least after you were spoken of . There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of ‘ Fanny , ’ and spoke of her as a sister should . But Mrs. Rushworth ’s day of good looks will come ; we have cards for her first party on the 28th . Then she will be in beauty , for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street . I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle ’s , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . Henry could not have afforded her such a house . I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never force your name upon her again . She will grow sober by degrees . From all that I hear and guess , Baron Wildenheim ’s attentions to Julia continue , but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement . She ought to do better . A poor honourable is no catch , and I can not imagine any liking in the case , for take away his rants , and the poor baron has nothing . What a difference a vowel makes ! If his rents were but equal to his rants ! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly ; detained , perchance , by parish duties . There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted . I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a young one . Adieu ! my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry ’s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . ”
156385	156387	156383	156383	they	3002	“ airs ”
158166	158171	158157	158157	her	261	“ William ’s friend , ”
158839	158849	158807	158807	Fanny	111	“ then by this time it is all settled , ”
158893	158926	158934	158934	he	130	“ It was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise ”
158998	159024	158981	158981	she	104	“ Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ”
159034	159075	159025	159026	Mrs. Price	104	“ Her daughters were very much confined ; Portsmouth was a sad place ; they did not often get out ; and she knew they had some errands in the town , which they would be very glad to do . ”
159806	159829	159830	159830	he	229	“ Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! ”
160772	160780	160781	160781	he	130	“ Mansfield , Sotherton , Thornton Lacey , ”
160784	160856	160781	160781	he	130	“ what a society will be comprised in those houses ! And at Michaelmas , perhaps , a fourth may be added : some small hunting - box in the vicinity of everything so dear ; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey , as Edmund Bertram once good - humouredly proposed , I hope I foresee two objections : two fair , excellent , irresistible objections to that plan . ”
162245	162256	162258	162258	he	130	“ You have been here a month , I think ? ”
162260	162281	162258	162258	he	130	“ No ; not quite a month . It is only four weeks to - morrow since I left Mansfield . ”
162282	162299	162258	162258	he	130	“ You are a most accurate and honest reckoner . I should call that a month . ”
162300	162310	162258	162258	he	130	“ I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening . ”
162311	162326	162258	162258	he	130	“ And it is to be a two months ’ visit , is not ? ”
162327	162345	162258	162258	he	130	“ Yes . My uncle talked of two months . I suppose it will not be less . ”
162346	162362	162258	162258	he	130	“ And how are you to be conveyed back again ? Who comes for you ? ”
162363	162406	162258	162258	he	130	“ I do not know . I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt . Perhaps I may be to stay longer . It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months ’ end . ”
162417	162547	162549	162549	he	3168	“ I know Mansfield , I know its way , I know its faults towards you . I know the danger of your being so far forgotten , as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family . I am aware that you may be left here week after week , if Sir Thomas can not settle everything for coming himself , or sending your aunt ’s maid for you , without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year . This will not do . Two months is an ample allowance ; I should think six weeks quite enough . I am considering your sister ’s health , ”
162556	162616	162552	162552	himself	3168	“ which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to . She requires constant air and exercise . When you know her as well as I do , I am sure you will agree that she does , and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country . If , therefore ”
162624	162730	162733	162733	him	3169	“ you find yourself growing unwell , and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield , without waiting for the two months to be ended , that must not be regarded as of any consequence , if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual , and will only let my sister know it , give her only the slightest hint , she and I will immediately come down , and take you back to Mansfield . You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done . You know all that would be felt on the occasion . ”
162742	162748	162749	162749	he	3169	“ I am perfectly serious , ”
162752	162829	162749	162749	he	3169	“ as you perfectly know . And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition . Indeed , you shall not ; it shall not be in your power ; for so long only as you positively say , in every letter to Mary , ‘ I am well , ’ and I know you can not speak or write a falsehood , so long only shall you be considered as well . ”
162912	162921	162923	162923	he	3169	“ I wish you were not so tired , ”
162935	163213	162923	162923	he	3169	house—“I wish I left you in stronger health . Is there anything I can do for you in town ? I have half an idea of going into Norfolk again soon . I am not satisfied about Maddison . I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible , and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill , which I design for somebody else . I must come to an understanding with him . I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham , any more than on the north : that I will be master of my own property . I was not explicit enough with him before . The mischief such a man does on an estate , both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor , is inconceivable . I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly , and put everything at once on such a footing as can not be afterwards swerved from . Maddison is a clever fellow ; I do not wish to displace him , provided he does not try to displace me ; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me , and worse than simple to let him give me a hard - hearted , griping fellow for a tenant , instead of an honest man , to whom I have given half a promise already . Would it not be worse than simple ? Shall I go ? Do you advise it ? ”
163214	163226	163410	163410	He	3174	“ I advise ! You know very well what is right . ”
163227	163252	163410	163410	He	3174	“ Yes . When you give me your opinion , I always know what is right . Your judgment is my rule of right . ”
163253	163300	162923	162923	he	3169	“ Oh , no ! do not say so . We have all a better guide in ourselves , if we would attend to it , than any other person can be . Good - bye ; I wish you a pleasant journey to - morrow . ”
163301	163313	163410	163410	He	3174	“ Is there nothing I can do for you in town ? ”
163314	163324	163410	163410	He	3174	“ Nothing ; I am much obliged to you . ”
163325	163333	163410	163410	He	3174	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ”
163334	163376	163410	163410	He	3174	“ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ”
163377	163395	163396	163396	He	3174	“ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ”
164026	164645	164013	164013	her	3175	“ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love . I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . I have no news for you . You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin ’s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long ago ; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make me miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy . I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did — at least , one sees many worse . He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ? If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious . I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales , but — but — but Yours affectionately . ”
164646	164962	164013	164013	her	3175	“ I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund ’s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself — I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire . My dear little creature , do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks . Those vile sea - breezes are the ruin of beauty and health . My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea , which the Admiral of course never believed , but I know it was so . I am at your service and Henry ’s , at an hour ’s notice . I should like the scheme , and we would make a little circuit , and shew you Everingham in our way , and perhaps you would not mind passing through London , and seeing the inside of St. George ’s , Hanover Square . Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted . What a long letter ! one word more . Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that you approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for we have a party that evening . The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable . He will see the Rushworths , which I own I am not sorry for — having a little curiosity , and so I think has he — though he will not acknowledge it . ”
166105	167804	167824	167824	Fanny	111	“ My Dear Fanny,—Excuse me that I have not written before . Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . Could I have sent a few happy lines , they should not have been wanting , but nothing of that nature was ever in my power . I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . My hopes are much weaker . You are probably aware of this already . So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . I will not be prevented , however , from making my own communication . Our confidences in you need not clash . I ask no questions . There is something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend , and that whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us , we are united in our love of you . It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . I have been returned since Saturday . I was three weeks in London , and saw her ( for London ) very often . I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected . I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield . It was her manner , however , rather than any unfrequency of meeting . Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered : my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . I need not particularise . You know the weak side of her character , and may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me . She was in high spirits , and surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad sense to her too lively mind . I do not like Mrs. Fraser . She is a cold - hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment not to faults of judgment , or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , Lady Stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine . They have been leading her astray for years . Could she be detached from them!—and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . I can not give her up , Fanny . She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . If I did not believe that she had some regard for me , of course I should not say this , but I do believe it . I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference . I have no jealousy of any individual . It is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of . It is the habits of wealth that I fear . Her ideas are not higher than her own fortune may warrant , but they are beyond what our incomes united could authorise . There is comfort , however , even here . I could better bear to lose her because not rich enough , than because of my profession . That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . Her prejudices , I trust , are not so strong as they were . You have my thoughts exactly as they arise , my dear Fanny ; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory , but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind . Having once begun , it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel . I can not give her up . Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny . Were it a decided thing , an actual refusal , I hope I should know how to bear it , and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart , and in the course of a few years — but I am writing nonsense . Were I refused , I must bear it ; and till I am , I can never cease to try for her . This is the truth . The only question is how ? What may be the likeliest means ? I have sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter , and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield . Even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June ; but June is at a great distance , and I believe I shall write to her . I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter . To be at an early certainty is a material object . My present state is miserably irksome . Considering everything , I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of explanation . I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser , and I at a distance unable to help my own cause . A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation , and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision , an adviser may , in an unlucky moment , lead it to do what it may afterwards regret . I must think this matter over a little . This long letter , full of my own concerns alone , will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny . The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser ’s party . I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . There is not a shadow of wavering . He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . There was marked coolness on her side . They scarcely spoke . I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . You will wish to hear my opinion of Maria ’s degree of comfort as a wife . There is no appearance of unhappiness . I hope they get on pretty well together . I dined twice in Wimpole Street , and might have been there oftener , but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother . Julia seems to enjoy London exceedingly . I had little enjoyment there , but have less here . We are not a lively party . You are very much wanted . I miss you more than I can express . My mother desires her best love , and hopes to hear from you soon . She talks of you almost every hour , and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you . My father means to fetch you himself , but it will not be till after Easter , when he has business in town . You are happy at Portsmouth , I hope , but this must not be a yearly visit . I want you at home , that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey . I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress . I think I shall certainly write . It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath ; they leave Mansfield on Monday . I am glad of it . I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody ; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.—Yours ever , my dearest Fanny . ”
167805	167822	167824	167824	Fanny	111	“ I never will , no , I certainly never will wish for a letter again , ”
167833	167864	167865	167865	Fanny	111	“ What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow ? Not till after Easter ! How shall I bear it ? And my poor aunt talking of me every hour ! ”
167933	167942	167944	167944	she	3215	“ There is no good in this delay , ”
167946	168003	168004	168004	She	3215	“ Why is not it settled ? He is blinded , and nothing will open his eyes ; nothing can , after having had truths before him so long in vain . He will marry her , and be poor and miserable . God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable ! ”
168011	168206	168004	168004	She	3215	“ ‘ So very fond of me ! ’ ’ tis nonsense all . She loves nobody but herself and her brother . Her friends leading her astray for years ! She is quite as likely to have led them astray . They have all , perhaps , been corrupting one another ; but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them , she is the less likely to have been hurt , except by their flattery . ‘ The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife . ’ I firmly believe it . It is an attachment to govern his whole life . Accepted or refused , his heart is wedded to her for ever . ‘ The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny . ’ Edmund , you do not know me . The families would never be connected if you did not connect them ! Oh ! write , write . Finish it at once . Let there be an end of this suspense . Fix , commit , condemn yourself . ”
168597	168622	168591	168592	her aunt	446	“ My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence , which I make no doubt will give you much concern ”
168818	168828	168830	168831	her ladyship	902	“ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ”
168840	169016	168830	168831	her ladyship	902	“ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me . We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on every account , and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury . As I have little doubt of your feeling for us , my dear Fanny , under these distressing circumstances , I will write again very soon . ”
169266	169363	169258	169258	she	446	“ He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do . I am sure he has been very ill . Poor Tom ! I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me . But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . ”
169622	169636	169602	169602	she	104	“ My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . ”
170290	170338	170283	170283	Edmund	105	“ On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends . When Tom is better , I shall go . ”
170591	170601	170563	170563	her	446	“ With what intense desire she wants her home , ”
170725	170769	170718	170719	her aunt	446	“ I can not but say I much regret your being from home at this distressing time , so very trying to my spirits . I trust and hope , and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again , ”
170810	170832	170854	170854	she	446	“ When I go back into Northamptonshire , or when I return to Mansfield , I shall do so and so . ”
171598	172372	172658	172658	Fanny	111	“ Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly . This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate answer . I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park , and you , no doubt , are perfectly able to give it . One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery . I thought little of his illness at first . I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with , and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder , and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him ; but now it is confidently asserted that he is really in a decline , that the symptoms are most alarming , and that part of the family , at least , are aware of it . If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling . To have such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy . Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully . I really am quite agitated on the subject . Fanny , Fanny , I see you smile and look cunning , but , upon my honour , I never bribed a physician in my life . Poor young man ! If he is to die , there will be two poor young men less in the world ; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one , that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them . It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas , but the evil of a few days may be blotted out in part . Varnish and gilding hide many stains . It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name . With real affection , Fanny , like mine , more might be overlooked . Write to me by return of post , judge of my anxiety , and do not trifle with it . Tell me the real truth , as you have it from the fountainhead . And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own . Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous . I put it to your conscience , whether ‘ Sir Edmund ’ would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible ‘ Sir . ’ Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street . Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . I suppose Mrs. R. ’s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her . The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment . I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ? Henry is not at hand , so I have nothing to say from him . Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?—Yours ever , Mary . ”
172373	172657	172658	172658	Fanny	111	“ I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it . Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street to - day ; the old lady is come . Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond . He does it every spring . Be assured he cares for nobody but you . At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours . In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul . Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come . It will do us all good . He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park . It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience — conscientious as you are — keep away , when you have the means of returning . I have not time or patience to give half Henry ’s messages ; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is unalterable affection . ”
172945	172996	172997	172997	Her	3328	“ Her uncle , she understood , meant to fetch her ; and as her cousin ’s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . ”
173286	173451	173452	173452	Fanny	111	“ A most scandalous , ill - natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country . Depend upon it , there is some mistake , and that a day or two will clear it up ; at any rate , that Henry is blameless , and in spite of a moment ’s etourderie , thinks of nobody but you . Say not a word of it ; hear nothing , surmise nothing , whisper nothing till I write again . I am sure it will be all hushed up , and nothing proved but Rushworth ’s folly . If they are gone , I would lay my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park , and Julia with them . But why would not you let us come for you ? I wish you may not repent it.—Yours , etc . ”
174151	174165	174136	174136	his	645	“ What ’s the name of your great cousins in town , Fan ? ”
174175	174180	174136	174136	his	645	“ Rushworth , sir . ”
174181	174191	174136	174136	his	645	“ And do n’t they live in Wimpole Street ? ”
174192	174197	174136	174136	his	645	“ Yes , sir . ”
174198	174215	174136	174136	his	645	“ Then , there ’s the devil to pay among them , that ’s all ! There ”
174225	174313	174171	174171	her	3341	“ much good may such fine relations do you . I do n’t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters ; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less . But , by G — ! if she belonged to me , I ’d give her the rope ’s end as long as I could stand over her . A little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things . ”
174319	174423	174314	174314	Fanny	111	“ it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial fracas in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street ; the beautiful Mrs. R. , whose name had not long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen , and who had promised to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world , having quitted her husband ’s roof in company with the well - known and captivating Mr. C. , the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R. , and it was not known even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone . ”
174424	174432	174434	174434	Fanny	111	“ It is a mistake , sir , ”
174437	174457	174458	174458	She	3366	“ it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . ”
174546	174554	174555	174555	he	229	“ It might be all a lie , ”
174558	174581	174555	174555	he	229	“ but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way , that there was no answering for anybody . ”
174582	174592	174594	174595	Mrs. Price	104	“ Indeed , I hope it is not true , ”
174598	174645	174594	174595	Mrs. Price	104	“ it would be so very shocking ! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet , I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? And it would not be ten minutes ’ work . ”
175412	175665	175410	175410	Edmund	105	“ Dear Fanny,—You know our present wretchedness . May God support you under your share ! We have been here two days , but there is nothing to be done . They can not be traced . You may not have heard of the last blow — Julia ’s elopement ; she is gone to Scotland with Yates . She left London a few hours before we entered it . At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully . Now it seems nothing ; yet it is an heavy aggravation . My father is not overpowered . More can not be hoped . He is still able to think and act ; and I write , by his desire , to propose your returning home . He is anxious to get you there for my mother ’s sake . I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this , and hope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield . My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a few months . Settle it as you like ; say what is proper ; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment ! Do justice to his meaning , however I may confuse it . You may imagine something of my present state . There is no end of the evil let loose upon us . You will see me early by the mail.—Yours , etc . ”
176340	176353	176327	176327	herself	265	“ My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ”
176406	176421	176387	176387	his	105	“ Have you breakfasted ? When shall you be ready ? Does Susan go ? ”
176942	176983	176928	176928	her	3407	“ No wonder — you must feel it — you must suffer . How a man who had once loved , could desert you ! But yours — your regard was new compared with —— Fanny , think of me ! ”
177400	177410	177374	177375	Lady Bertram	103	“ Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . ”
180107	180394	180092	180092	she	125	“ ‘ I heard you were in town , ’ said she ; ‘ I wanted to see you . Let us talk over this sad business . What can equal the folly of our two relations ? ’ I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke . She felt reproved . Sometimes how quick to feel ! With a graver look and voice she then added , ‘ I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister ’s expense . ’ So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you . I can not recall all her words . I would not dwell upon them if I could . Their substance was great anger at the folly of each . She reprobated her brother ’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . Guess what I must have felt . To hear the woman whom — no harsher name than folly given ! So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? This is what the world does . For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ? Spoilt , spoilt ! ”
180410	180526	180527	180527	He	3528	“ I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever . She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure . The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short — oh , Fanny ! it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated . It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her . ”
180530	180534	180536	180536	Fanny	111	“ And what , ”
180545	180551	180536	180536	Fanny	111	“ what could you say ? ”
180552	180710	180527	180527	He	3528	“ Nothing , nothing to be understood . I was like a man stunned . She went on , began to talk of you ; yes , then she began to talk of you , regretting , as well she might , the loss of such a—. There she spoke very rationally . But she has always done justice to you . ‘ He has thrown away , ’ said she , ‘ such a woman as he will never see again . She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . ’ My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been — but what never can be now . You do not wish me to be silent ? If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I have done . ”
180718	180722	180724	180724	he	3529	“ Thank God , ”
180726	180902	180724	180724	he	3529	“ We were all disposed to wonder , but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer . She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection ; yet , even here , there was alloy , a dash of evil ; for in the midst of it she could exclaim , ‘ Why would not she have him ? It is all her fault . Simple girl ! I shall never forgive her . Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object . He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again . It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation , in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham . ’ Could you have believed it possible ? But the charm is broken . My eyes are opened . ”
180903	180906	180908	180908	Fanny	111	“ Cruel ! ”
180910	180936	180908	180908	Fanny	111	“ quite cruel . At such a moment to give way to gaiety , to speak with lightness , and to you ! Absolute cruelty . ”
180937	181137	180724	180724	he	3529	“ Cruelty , do you call it ? We differ there . No , hers is not a cruel nature . I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings . The evil lies yet deeper : in her total ignorance , unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings ; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did . She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak , as she imagined everybody else would speak . Hers are not faults of temper . She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would—. Hers are faults of principle , Fanny ; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted , vitiated mind . Perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret . Not so , however . Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do . I told her so . ”
181138	181142	180724	180724	he	3529	“ Did you ? ”
181143	181155	180908	180908	Fanny	111	“ Yes ; when I left her I told her so . ”
181156	181163	180724	180724	he	3529	“ How long were you together ? ”
181164	181210	181211	181211	He	3530	“ Five - and - twenty minutes . Well , she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them . She spoke of it , Fanny , with a steadier voice than I can . ”
181223	181503	181211	181211	He	3530	“ ‘ We must persuade Henry to marry her , ’ said she ; ‘ and what with honour , and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny , I do not despair of it . Fanny he must give up . I do not think that even he could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty . My influence , which is not small shall all go that way ; and when once married , and properly supported by her own family , people of respectability as they are , she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree . In some circles , we know , she would never be admitted , but with good dinners , and large parties , there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance ; and there is , undoubtedly , more liberality and candour on those points than formerly . What I advise is , that your father be quiet . Do not let him injure his own cause by interference . Persuade him to let things take their course . If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry ’s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him . I know how he is likely to be influenced . Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . ’ ”
181551	181556	181558	181558	he	105	“ Now , Fanny , ”
181560	182382	181558	181558	he	105	“ I shall soon have done . I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished — more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , ‘ A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . ’ She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she . I looked back . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done . ”
