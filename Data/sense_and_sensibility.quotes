1207	1250	1251	1251	He	87	“ Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . ”
2287	2298	2300	2301	her husband	319	“ It was my father ’s last request to me , ”
2303	2313	2300	2301	her husband	319	“ that I should assist his widow and daughters . ”
2314	2373	2300	2301	her husband	319	“ He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . ”
2374	2496	2300	2301	her husband	319	“ He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time . The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home . ”
2497	2525	2526	2526	she	368	“ Well , then , _ let _ something be done for them ; but _ that _ something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider , ”
2529	2571	2526	2526	she	368	“ that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy — ”
2572	2579	2581	2582	her husband	319	“ Why , to be sure , ”
2587	2630	2526	2526	she	368	“ that would make great difference . The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . ”
2631	2638	2300	2301	her husband	319	“ To be sure it would . ”
2639	2670	2526	2526	she	368	“ Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! ”
2671	2714	2526	2526	she	368	“ Oh ! beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if _ really _ his sisters ! And as it is — only half blood!—But you have such a generous spirit ! ”
2715	2726	2727	2727	he	319	“ I would not wish to do any thing mean , ”
2730	2771	2727	2727	he	319	“ One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . ”
2772	2784	2786	2787	the lady	370	“ There is no knowing what _ they _ may expect , ”
2789	2811	2786	2787	the lady	370	“ but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . ”
2812	2864	2526	2526	she	368	“ Certainly — and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother ’s death — a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . ”
2865	2931	2727	2727	he	319	“ To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . ”
2932	3004	2786	2787	the lady	370	“ That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them — something of the annuity kind I mean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . ”
3021	3026	3028	3028	she	280	“ To be sure , ”
3030	3061	3028	3028	she	280	“ it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . ”
3062	3080	2727	2727	he	319	“ Fifteen years ! my dear Fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . ”
3081	3324	2727	2727	he	319	“ Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father ’s will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother ’s disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . ”
3325	3333	3335	3336	Mr. Dashwood	85	“ It is certainly an unpleasant thing , ”
3338	3400	3335	3336	Mr. Dashwood	85	“ to have those kind of yearly drains on one ’s income . One ’s fortune , as your mother justly says , is _ not _ one ’s own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one ’s independence . ”
3401	3486	2727	2727	he	319	“ Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . ”
3487	3605	2727	2727	he	319	“ I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . ”
3606	3922	3335	3336	Mr. Dashwood	85	“ To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I ’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that?—They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year ! I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give _ you _ something . ”
3923	3928	3930	3931	Mr. Dashwood	85	“ Upon my word , ”
3933	4018	3930	3931	Mr. Dashwood	85	“ I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . ”
4019	4022	4024	4026	Mrs. John Dashwood	88	“ Certainly , ”
4028	4093	4024	4026	Mrs. John Dashwood	88	“ But , however , _ one _ thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . ”
4094	4126	3930	3931	Mr. Dashwood	85	“ That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . ”
4127	4232	3930	3931	Mr. Dashwood	85	“ Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place _ they _ can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of _ them _ . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to _ them _ . ”
5236	5241	5243	5243	she	88	“ It is enough , ”
5245	5266	5243	5243	she	88	“ to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . ”
5267	5275	5277	5277	Elinor	89	“ I think you will like him , ”
5279	5287	5277	5277	Elinor	89	“ when you know more of him . ”
5288	5292	5294	5295	her mother	332	“ Like him ! ”
5300	5311	5294	5295	her mother	332	“ I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . ”
5312	5318	5277	5277	Elinor	89	“ You may esteem him . ”
5319	5334	5294	5295	her mother	332	“ I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . ”
5461	5471	5473	5473	she	88	“ In a few months , my dear Marianne , ”
5475	5500	5473	5473	she	88	“ Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but _ she _ will be happy . ”
5501	5513	5430	5430	she	88	“ Oh ! Mama , how shall we do without her ? ”
5514	5585	5473	5473	she	88	“ My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward ’s heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister ’s choice ? ”
5586	5589	5591	5591	Marianne	90	“ Perhaps , ”
5593	5883	5591	5591	Marianne	90	“ I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet — he is not the kind of young man — there is something wanting — his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mama , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor ’s drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward ’s manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference ! ”
5884	5914	5473	5473	she	88	“ He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you _ would _ give him Cowper . ”
5915	6035	5591	5591	Marianne	90	“ Nay , Mama , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke _ my _ heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward ’s virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . ”
6036	6088	5473	5473	she	88	“ Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from hers ! ”
6092	6101	6103	6103	Marianne	90	“ What a pity it is , Elinor , ”
6105	6115	6103	6103	Marianne	90	“ that Edward should have no taste for drawing . ”
6116	6122	6124	6124	Elinor	89	“ No taste for drawing ! ”
6126	6240	6124	6124	Elinor	89	“ why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . ”
6318	6324	6326	6326	Elinor	89	“ I hope , Marianne , ”
6328	6381	6326	6326	Elinor	89	“ you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if _ that _ were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . ”
6419	6496	6416	6416	she	90	“ Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . ”
6497	6502	6504	6504	Elinor	89	“ I am sure , ”
6510	6537	6504	6504	Elinor	89	“ that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . ”
6549	6557	6559	6559	Elinor	89	“ Of his sense and his goodness , ”
6561	6824	6559	6559	Elinor	89	“ no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? ”
6825	6871	6872	6872	Elinor	89	“ I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . ”
6981	6989	6991	6991	she	89	“ I do not attempt to deny , ”
6993	7012	6991	6991	she	89	“ that I think very highly of him — that I greatly esteem , that I like him . ”
7020	7059	7013	7013	Marianne	90	“ Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . ”
7066	7070	7072	7072	she	89	“ Excuse me , ”
7074	7319	7072	7072	she	89	“ and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion — the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must _ not _ believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little — scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny ’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . ”
7339	7349	7351	7351	she	90	“ And you really are not engaged to him ! ”
7353	7431	7351	7351	she	90	“ Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . _ I _ shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! ”
8494	8517	8518	8518	She	88	“ Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? ”
8532	8539	8540	8540	she	88	“ It is but a cottage , ”
8543	8591	8540	8540	she	88	“ but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . ”
9383	9389	9391	9391	Marianne	90	“ Dear , dear Norland ! ”
9410	9519	9394	9394	she	90	“ when shall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you , ye well - known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!—No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoy you ? ”
10033	10044	10046	10046	she	88	“ As for the house itself , to be sure , ”
10048	10243	10046	10046	she	88	“ it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . ”
12914	13010	12900	12901	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ But at least , Mama , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings , but he is old enough to be _ my _ father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? ”
13011	13014	13016	13016	Elinor	89	“ Infirmity ! ”
13018	13060	13016	13016	Elinor	89	“ do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! ”
13061	13083	12900	12901	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? ”
13084	13089	13091	13092	her mother	332	“ My dearest child , ”
13096	13133	13091	13092	her mother	332	“ at this rate you must be in continual terror of _ my _ decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . ”
13134	13188	12900	12901	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Mama , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . ”
13189	13192	13194	13194	Elinor	89	“ Perhaps , ”
13196	13254	13194	13194	Elinor	89	“ thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon ’s being thirty - five any objection to his marrying _ her _ . ”
13255	13263	13265	13265	Marianne	90	“ A woman of seven and twenty , ”
13272	13393	13265	13265	Marianne	90	“ can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . ”
13394	13403	13405	13405	Elinor	89	“ It would be impossible , I know , ”
13407	13488	13405	13405	Elinor	89	“ to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . ”
13489	13497	13499	13499	Marianne	90	“ But he talked of flannel waistcoats , ”
13501	13532	13499	13499	Marianne	90	“ and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . ”
13533	13579	13405	13405	Elinor	89	“ Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? ”
13591	13594	13596	13596	Marianne	90	“ Mama , ”
13598	13659	13596	13596	Marianne	90	“ I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ? ”
13660	13671	13673	13674	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ Had you any idea of his coming so soon ? ”
13676	13734	13673	13674	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ _ I _ had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ? ”
13735	13750	13499	13499	Marianne	90	“ I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . ”
13751	13803	13499	13499	Marianne	90	“ I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . ”
13804	13954	13673	13674	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! In Edward ’s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? ”
14470	14479	14481	14481	Marianne	90	“ Is there a felicity in the world , ”
14483	14497	14481	14481	Marianne	90	“ superior to this?—Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . ”
15303	15306	15308	15309	Sir John	99	“ Willoughby ! ”
15311	15342	15308	15309	Sir John	99	“ what , is _ he _ in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . ”
15343	15349	15351	15352	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ You know him then , ”
15354	15373	15351	15352	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year . ”
15374	15385	15308	15309	Sir John	99	“ And what sort of a young man is he ? ”
15386	15416	15308	15309	Sir John	99	“ As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . ”
15417	15430	15432	15432	Marianne	90	“ And is _ that _ all you can say for him ? ”
15436	15457	15432	15432	Marianne	90	“ But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? ”
15464	15469	15471	15471	he	99	“ Upon my soul , ”
15473	15520	15471	15471	he	99	“ I do not know much about him as to all _ that _ . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? ”
15550	15556	15558	15558	Elinor	89	“ But who is he ? ”
15560	15574	15558	15558	Elinor	89	“ Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ? ”
15635	15718	15587	15587	he	99	“ Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . ”
15719	15725	15727	15728	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ I do not believe , ”
15736	15819	15727	15728	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of _ my _ daughters towards what you call _ catching him _ . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . ”
15820	15837	15839	15840	Sir John	99	“ He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , ”
15842	15868	15839	15840	Sir John	99	“ I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o’clock till four , without once sitting down . ”
15869	15874	15876	15876	Marianne	90	“ Did he indeed ? ”
15881	15889	15876	15876	Marianne	90	“ and with elegance , with spirit ? ”
15890	15905	15839	15840	Sir John	99	“ Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . ”
15906	15945	15876	15876	Marianne	90	“ That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . ”
15946	15958	15960	15961	Sir John	99	“ Aye , aye , I see how it will be , ”
15963	15988	15960	15961	Sir John	99	“ I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . ”
15989	15998	16000	16000	Marianne	90	“ That is an expression , Sir John , ”
16004	16074	16000	16000	Marianne	90	“ which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ‘ setting one ’s cap at a man , ’ or ‘ making a conquest , ’ are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . ”
16098	16153	16085	16085	he	99	“ Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . ”
16713	16718	16720	16720	Elinor	89	“ Well , Marianne , ”
16730	16852	16720	16720	Elinor	89	“ for _ one _ morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby ’s opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper . But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . ”
16853	16856	16858	16858	Marianne	90	“ Elinor , ”
16860	16958	16858	16858	Marianne	90	“ is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful — had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . ”
16959	16963	16965	16966	her mother	332	“ My love , ”
16968	17007	16965	16966	her mother	332	“ you must not be offended with Elinor — she was only in jest . I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . ”
17790	17799	17801	17801	Willoughby	107	“ Brandon is just the kind of man , ”
17813	17840	17801	17801	Willoughby	107	“ whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . ”
17841	17851	17853	17853	Marianne	90	“ That is exactly what I think of him , ”
17855	17864	17866	17866	Elinor	89	“ Do not boast of it , however , ”
17868	17904	17866	17866	Elinor	89	“ for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . ”
17905	17915	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ That he is patronised by _ you _ , ”
17919	17972	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? ”
17973	18024	17801	17801	Willoughby	107	“ But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . ”
18025	18039	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ In defence of your _ protégé _ you can even be saucy . ”
18040	18132	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ My _ protégé _ , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . ”
18133	18139	18141	18141	Marianne	90	“ That is to say , ”
18144	18166	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . ”
18167	18202	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ He _ would _ have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . ”
18203	18206	18208	18208	Willoughby	107	“ Perhaps , ”
18210	18228	18208	18208	Willoughby	107	“ his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . ”
18229	18257	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ I may venture to say that _ his _ observations have stretched much further than _ your _ candour . But why should you dislike him ? ”
18258	18317	17917	17917	Willoughby	107	“ I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body ’s good word , and nobody ’s notice ; who has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . ”
18318	18323	18325	18325	Marianne	90	“ Add to which , ”
18327	18357	18325	18325	Marianne	90	“ that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . ”
18358	18370	18372	18372	Elinor	89	“ You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , ”
18374	18437	18372	18372	Elinor	89	“ and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation _ I _ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart . ”
18438	18442	18444	18444	Willoughby	107	“ Miss Dashwood , ”
18446	18598	18444	18444	Willoughby	107	“ you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . ”
19658	19672	19650	19650	he	104	“ Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . ”
19673	19676	19678	19678	Elinor	89	“ No , ”
19680	19687	19650	19650	he	104	“ her opinions are all romantic . ”
19688	19703	19650	19650	he	104	“ Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . ”
19704	19776	19650	19650	he	104	“ I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . ”
19777	19785	19786	19786	he	104	“ This will probably be the case , ”
19789	19822	19786	19786	he	104	“ and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . ”
19823	19832	19834	19834	Elinor	89	“ I can not agree with you there , ”
19836	19895	19900	19900	he	104	“ There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne ’s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . ”
19908	19968	19900	19900	he	104	“ Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? ”
19969	20005	19900	19900	he	104	“ Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment ’s being pardonable . ”
20006	20009	20011	20011	he	104	“ This , ”
20013	20111	20011	20011	he	104	“ can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments — No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change — from a series of unfortunate circumstances — ”
20405	20418	20419	20419	she	89	“ He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it , ”
20422	20460	20419	20419	she	89	“ and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me . Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . ”
20582	20589	20591	20591	she	89	“ You are mistaken , Elinor , ”
20594	20721	20591	20591	she	89	“ in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;—it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . ”
20926	20976	20919	20919	he	107	voice,—“But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . ”
21153	21158	21159	21159	she	84	“ Oh , Elinor ! ”
21162	21187	21159	21159	she	84	“ I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . ”
21188	21194	21196	21196	Elinor	89	“ You have said so , ”
21198	21252	21196	21196	Elinor	89	“ almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . ”
21253	21282	21159	21159	she	84	“ But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . ”
21283	21304	21159	21159	she	84	“ Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of _ his _ . ”
21305	21420	21159	21159	she	84	“ But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne ’s . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . ”
21525	21536	21514	21514	Margaret	91	“ I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? ”
21616	21633	21593	21593	she	90	“ Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . ”
21634	21643	21645	21645	Margaret	91	“ I never had any conjectures about it , ”
21647	21658	21645	21645	Margaret	91	“ it was you who told me of it yourself . ”
21677	21692	21694	21695	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , ”
21697	21705	21694	21695	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ What is the gentleman ’s name ? ”
21706	21731	21645	21645	Margaret	91	“ I must not tell , ma’am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . ”
21732	21765	21694	21695	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . ”
21766	21784	21694	21695	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ No , _ that _ he is not . He is of no profession at all . ”
21785	21788	21790	21790	Marianne	90	“ Margaret , ”
21795	21818	21790	21790	Marianne	90	“ you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . ”
21819	21849	21694	21695	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. ”
21865	21872	21874	21874	she	89	“ that it rained very hard , ”
22376	22384	22386	22387	Sir John	99	“ What is the matter with Brandon ? ”
22393	22403	22405	22406	Lady Middleton	100	“ I hope he has had no bad news , ”
22408	22426	22405	22406	Lady Middleton	100	“ It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . ”
22434	22444	22446	22447	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; ”
22457	22468	22446	22447	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ None at all , ma’am , I thank you . ”
22469	22488	22405	22406	Lady Middleton	100	“ Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . ”
22489	22507	22446	22447	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ No , ma’am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . ”
22508	22549	22446	22447	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this wo n’t do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . ”
22550	22555	22557	22558	Lady Middleton	100	“ My dear madam , ”
22560	22567	22557	22558	Lady Middleton	100	“ recollect what you are saying . ”
22568	22582	22584	22585	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? ”
22595	22604	22584	22585	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ No , indeed , it is not . ”
22605	22626	22557	22558	Lady Middleton	100	“ Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well . ”
22627	22635	22637	22637	he	869	“ Whom do you mean , ma’am ? ”
22643	22652	22637	22637	he	869	“ Oh ! you know who I mean . ”
22653	22661	22663	22663	he	869	“ I am particularly sorry , ma’am , ”
22669	22691	22663	22663	he	869	“ that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . ”
22692	22696	22698	22699	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ In town ! ”
22701	22716	22698	22699	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? ”
22717	22724	22725	22725	he	869	“ My own loss is great , ”
22728	22760	22725	22725	he	869	“ in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell . ”
22770	22784	22786	22786	Marianne	90	“ But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , ”
22790	22797	22786	22786	Marianne	90	“ will it not be sufficient ? ”
22803	22808	22810	22811	Sir John.—“It	116	“ We must go , ”
22811	22839	22725	22725	he	869	John.—“It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . ”
22840	22865	22881	22882	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! ”
22866	22879	22881	22882	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ If you would but let us know what your business is , ”
22884	22897	22881	22882	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ we might see whether it could be put off or not . ”
22898	22907	22909	22909	Willoughby	107	“ You would not be six hours later , ”
22911	22923	22909	22909	Willoughby	107	“ if you were to defer your journey till our return . ”
22924	22936	22940	22940	Willoughby	107	“ I can not afford to lose _ one _ hour . ”
22950	23003	22940	22940	Willoughby	107	“ There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them . He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . ”
23004	23012	23014	23014	Marianne	90	“ I have no doubt of it , ”
23016	23034	23036	23037	Sir John	99	“ There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , ”
23039	23103	23036	23037	Sir John	99	“ when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . ”
23130	23142	23108	23108	his	104	“ Well , then , when will you come back again ? ”
23143	23153	23155	23156	her ladyship	567	“ I hope we shall see you at Barton , ”
23158	23181	23155	23156	her ladyship	567	“ as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return . ”
23182	23215	23108	23108	his	104	“ You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . ”
23216	23226	23228	23229	Sir John	99	“ Oh ! he must and shall come back , ”
23231	23250	23228	23229	Sir John	99	“ If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . ”
23251	23260	23262	23263	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Ay , so do , Sir John , ”
23265	23278	23262	23263	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . ”
23279	23302	23303	23304	Colonel Brandon	104	“ I do not want to pry into other men ’s concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . ”
23310	23323	23325	23326	Sir John	99	“ You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? ”
23328	23341	23325	23326	Sir John	99	“ No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post . ”
23342	23367	23262	23263	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey . But you had better change your mind . ”
23368	23379	23380	23380	He	104	“ I assure you it is not in my power . ”
23389	23409	23380	23380	He	104	“ Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? ”
23410	23419	23262	23263	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I am afraid , none at all . ”
23420	23438	23380	23380	He	104	“ Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . ”
23449	23453	23455	23456	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Come Colonel , ”
23458	23473	23455	23456	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ before you go , do let us know what you are going about . ”
23523	23534	23536	23537	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I can guess what his business is , however , ”
23540	23546	23548	23550	almost every body	877	“ Can you , ma’am ? ”
23552	23565	23548	23550	almost every body	877	“ Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . ”
23566	23573	23575	23575	Marianne	90	“ And who is Miss Williams ? ”
23577	23632	23575	23575	Marianne	90	“ What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel ’s , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . ”
23646	23653	23641	23641	she	90	“ She is his natural daughter . ”
23654	23657	23636	23636	her	90	“ Indeed ! ”
23658	23684	23636	23636	her	90	“ Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . ”
23957	23978	23979	23979	Marianne	90	“ I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning . ”
23987	23992	23979	23979	Marianne	90	“ Where , pray ? ”
23993	23999	24001	24001	Willoughby	107	“ Did not you know , ”
24003	24013	24001	24001	Willoughby	107	“ that we had been out in my curricle ? ”
24014	24095	24096	24096	Marianne	90	“ Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out _ where _ you had been to . I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . ”
24259	24295	24249	24249	Marianne	90	“ Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? ”
24296	24321	24236	24236	she	89	“ Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . ”
24322	24368	24249	24249	Marianne	90	“ Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . ”
24369	24374	24376	24376	Elinor	89	“ I am afraid , ”
24378	24392	24376	24376	Elinor	89	“ that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . ”
24393	24455	24236	24236	she	89	“ On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . ”
24456	24489	24249	24249	Marianne	90	“ But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? ”
24490	24566	24376	24376	Elinor	89	“ If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith ’s grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby ’s , and — ”
24567	24591	24592	24592	She	896	“ If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . ”
24632	24811	24618	24618	she	896	“ Perhaps , Elinor , it _ was _ rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.—There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,—but if it were newly fitted up — a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England . ”
24953	24966	24968	24968	she	103	“ Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure , ”
24970	25212	24968	24968	she	103	“ I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances _ now _ , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . ”
25715	25718	25719	25719	he	107	“ What ! ”
25720	25759	25698	25698	he	107	exclaimed—“Improve this dear cottage ! No . _ That _ I will never consent to . Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded . ”
25760	25766	25768	25769	Miss Dashwood	84	“ Do not be alarmed , ”
25771	25792	25768	25769	Miss Dashwood	84	“ nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it . ”
25793	25801	25802	25802	he	107	“ I am heartily glad of it , ”
25805	25821	25802	25802	he	107	“ May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better . ”
25822	25919	25698	25698	he	107	“ Thank you , Willoughby . But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world . Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ? ”
25920	25924	25926	25926	he	107	“ I am , ”
25928	25979	25926	25926	he	107	“ To me it is faultless . Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . ”
25980	25994	25996	25996	Elinor	89	“ With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose , ”
25998	26001	26003	26003	he	107	“ Yes , ”
26010	26060	26003	26003	he	107	“ with all and every thing belonging to it;—in no one convenience or inconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton . ”
26061	26066	26068	26068	Elinor	89	“ I flatter myself , ”
26070	26099	26068	26068	Elinor	89	“ that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . ”
26100	26106	26108	26108	Willoughby	107	“ There certainly are circumstances , ”
26110	26138	26108	26108	Willoughby	107	“ which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share . ”
26166	26173	26175	26175	he	107	“ How often did I wish , ”
26177	26290	26175	26175	he	107	“ when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for . Must it not have been so , Marianne ? ”
26308	26405	26305	26305	he	107	“ And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs. Dashwood ? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford . ”
26421	26428	26429	26429	he	107	“ You are a good woman , ”
26433	26502	26429	26429	he	107	“ Your promise makes me easy . Extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me . ”
26527	26536	26538	26539	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ? ”
26547	26573	26538	26539	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton . ”
26812	26820	26822	26823	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ Is anything the matter with her ? ”
26826	26830	26825	26825	she	88	entered—“is she ill ? ”
26831	26836	26837	26837	he	107	“ I hope not , ”
26853	26876	26837	26837	he	107	“ It is I who may rather expect to be ill — for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! ”
26877	26880	26825	26825	she	88	“ Disappointment ? ”
26881	26949	26825	26825	she	88	“ Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . ”
26950	26959	26837	26837	he	107	“ To London!—and are you going this morning ? ”
26960	26965	26825	26825	she	88	“ Almost this moment . ”
26966	26990	26991	26991	He	935	“ This is very unfortunate . But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;—and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . ”
26997	27026	26991	26991	He	935	“ You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth . ”
27027	27064	27065	27065	His	935	“ And is Mrs. Smith your only friend ? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? ”
27081	27087	27077	27077	he	935	“ You are too good . ”
27115	27184	27110	27111	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far _ that _ might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . ”
27185	27191	27193	27193	Willoughby	107	“ My engagements at present , ”
27197	27212	27213	27213	He	107	“ are of such a nature — that — I dare not flatter myself — ”
27243	27275	27234	27234	Willoughby	107	“ It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . ”
27548	27561	27563	27563	she	332	“ Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , ”
27572	27583	27563	27563	she	332	“ and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? ”
27584	27696	27563	27563	she	332	“ It is all very strange . So suddenly to be gone ! It seems but the work of a moment . And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? And now , after only ten minutes notice — Gone too without intending to return!—Something more than what he owned to us must have happened . He did not speak , he did not behave like himself . _ You _ must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be ? Can they have quarrelled ? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ? ”
27697	27756	27563	27563	she	332	“ It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see _ that _ . He had not the power of accepting it . I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . ”
27757	27763	27563	27563	she	332	“ Can you , indeed ! ”
27764	27991	27563	27563	she	332	“ Yes . I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;—but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can — it will not satisfy _ you _ , I know ; but you shall not talk _ me _ out of my trust in it . I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;—and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she _ does _ disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may _ not _ have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? ”
27992	28002	27563	27563	she	332	“ Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . ”
28003	28174	27563	27563	she	332	“ Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! You had rather take evil upon credit than good . You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter . You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ? And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? ”
28175	28293	27563	27563	she	332	“ I can hardly tell myself . But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him . There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has . But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once . Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . ”
28294	28337	27563	27563	she	332	“ Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?—I am happy — and he is acquitted . ”
28338	28397	27563	27563	she	332	“ Not entirely . It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they _ are _ engaged ) from Mrs. Smith — and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . ”
28398	28434	27563	27563	she	332	“ Concealing it from us ! my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ? This is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness . ”
28435	28444	28446	28446	Elinor	89	“ I want no proof of their affection , ”
28448	28456	28446	28446	Elinor	89	“ but of their engagement I do . ”
28457	28465	27563	27563	she	332	“ I am perfectly satisfied of both . ”
28466	28485	27563	27563	she	332	“ Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . ”
28486	28638	27563	27563	she	332	“ I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? How could such a thought occur to you ? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister ’s love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection;—that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ? ”
28639	28643	28645	28645	Elinor	89	“ I confess , ”
28647	28686	28645	28645	Elinor	89	“ that every circumstance except _ one _ is in favour of their engagement ; but that _ one _ is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . ”
28687	28751	27563	27563	she	332	“ How strange this is ! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ? ”
28752	28771	27563	27563	she	332	“ No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . ”
28772	28802	28645	28645	Elinor	89	“ But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . ”
28803	28862	27563	27563	she	332	“ You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . ”
28863	28974	27563	27563	she	332	“ A mighty concession indeed ! If you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . Ungracious girl ! But _ I _ require no such proof . Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . You can not doubt your sister ’s wishes . It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ? can he be deceitful ? ”
28975	28984	28986	28986	Elinor	89	“ I hope not , I believe not , ”
28988	29226	28986	28986	Elinor	89	“ I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;—he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , he might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;—but I will not raise objections against any one ’s conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . ”
29227	29350	29351	29351	They	947	“ You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though _ we _ have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . ”
29976	29981	29983	29983	she	88	“ Remember , Elinor , ”
29985	30037	29983	29983	she	88	“ how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John ’s hands . ”
30105	30115	30117	30117	she	89	“ Why do you not ask Marianne at once , ”
30119	30178	30117	30117	she	89	“ whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . ”
30179	30317	30318	30318	Elinor	89	“ I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne ’s heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . ”
30415	30462	30402	30403	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before _ that _ happens . ”
30463	30466	30468	30468	Marianne	90	“ Months ! ”
30474	30481	30468	30468	Marianne	90	“ No — nor many weeks . ”
30797	30807	30793	30793	Marianne	90	“ It is he ; it is indeed;—I know it is!”—and
30819	30850	30815	30815	Elinor	89	“ Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . ”
30851	30858	30860	30860	Marianne	90	“ He has , he has , ”
30862	30886	30860	30860	Marianne	90	“ I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse . I knew how soon he would come . ”
31299	31303	31304	31304	she	90	“ A fortnight ! ”
31343	31351	31353	31353	Elinor	89	“ Have you been lately in Sussex ? ”
31355	31365	31353	31353	Elinor	89	“ I was at Norland about a month ago . ”
31366	31376	31378	31378	Marianne	90	“ And how does dear , dear Norland look ? ”
31380	31386	31388	31388	Elinor	89	“ Dear , dear Norland , ”
31390	31415	31388	31388	Elinor	89	“ probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . ”
31416	31419	31421	31421	Marianne	90	“ Oh , ”
31423	31500	31421	31421	Marianne	90	“ with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . ”
31501	31508	31510	31510	Elinor	89	“ It is not every one , ”
31512	31521	31510	31510	Elinor	89	“ who has your passion for dead leaves . ”
31522	31543	31421	31421	Marianne	90	“ No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But _ sometimes _ they are . ”—As
31561	31566	31568	31568	she	90	“ Now , Edward , ”
31577	31647	31568	31568	she	90	“ here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ? To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . ”
31648	31655	31656	31656	he	1002	“ It is a beautiful country , ”
31659	31669	31656	31656	he	1002	“ but these bottoms must be dirty in winter . ”
31670	31684	31568	31568	she	90	“ How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? ”
31685	31688	31690	31690	he	1002	“ Because , ”
31694	31711	31690	31690	he	1002	“ among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane . ”
31712	31716	31720	31720	herself	90	“ How strange ! ”
31726	31740	31720	31720	herself	90	“ Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ? ”
31741	31747	31749	31749	Marianne	90	“ No , not all , ”
31751	31760	31749	31749	Marianne	90	“ we could not be more unfortunately situated . ”
31761	31764	31766	31767	her sister	336	“ Marianne , ”
31769	31819	31766	31767	her sister	336	“ how can you say so ? How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr. Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ? ”
31820	31823	31825	31825	Marianne	90	“ No , ”
31832	31839	31825	31825	Marianne	90	“ nor how many painful moments . ”
32149	32163	32165	32165	she	88	“ What are Mrs. Ferrars ’s views for you at present , Edward ? ”
32179	32193	32165	32165	she	88	“ are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? ”
32194	32217	32381	32381	Marianne	90	“ No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! ”
32218	32266	32165	32165	she	88	“ But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . ”
32267	32305	32165	32165	she	88	“ I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven ! I can not be forced into genius and eloquence . ”
32306	32322	32381	32381	Marianne	90	“ You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate . ”
32323	32372	32165	32165	she	88	“ As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so . ”
32373	32379	32381	32381	Marianne	90	“ Strange that it would ! ”
32383	32394	32381	32381	Marianne	90	“ What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? ”
32395	32401	32403	32403	Elinor	89	“ Grandeur has but little , ”
32405	32415	32403	32403	Elinor	89	“ but wealth has much to do with it . ”
32416	32422	32424	32424	Marianne	90	“ Elinor , for shame ! ”
32426	32460	32424	32424	Marianne	90	“ money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . ”
32461	32464	32466	32466	Elinor	89	“ Perhaps , ”
32470	32537	32466	32466	Elinor	89	“ we may come to the same point . _ Your _ competence and _ my _ wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? ”
32538	32555	32556	32556	Elinor	89	“ About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than _ that _ . ”
32559	32581	32556	32556	Elinor	89	“ _ two _ thousand a year ! _ one _ is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end . ”
32582	32596	32598	32598	Marianne	90	“ And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , ”
32600	32645	32598	32598	Marianne	90	“ A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . ”
32664	32667	32646	32646	Elinor	89	“ Hunters ! ”
32669	32682	32683	32683	Marianne	90	Edward—“but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . ”
32689	32695	32686	32686	she	90	“ But most people do . ”
32696	32700	32702	32702	Margaret	91	“ I wish , ”
32710	32722	32702	32702	Margaret	91	“ that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! ”
32723	32729	32731	32731	Marianne	90	“ Oh that they would ! ”
32751	32763	32765	32765	Elinor	89	“ We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , ”
32767	32776	32765	32765	Elinor	89	“ in spite of the insufficiency of wealth . ”
32777	32781	32783	32783	Margaret	91	“ Oh dear ! ”
32785	32801	32783	32783	Margaret	91	“ how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! ”
32814	32827	32806	32806	she	90	“ I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , ”
32832	32845	32829	32830	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ if my children were all to be rich without my help . ”
32846	32856	32858	32858	Elinor	89	“ You must begin your improvements on this house , ”
32860	32868	32858	32858	Elinor	89	“ and your difficulties will soon vanish . ”
32869	32881	32883	32883	Edward	98	“ What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , ”
32885	33035	32883	32883	Edward	98	“ in such an event ! What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you — and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books!—Thomson , Cowper , Scott — she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes . ”
33036	33109	32858	32858	Elinor	89	“ I love to be reminded of the past , Edward — whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it — and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent — some of it , at least — my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . ”
33110	33130	32858	32858	Elinor	89	“ And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs . ”
33131	33146	32883	32883	Edward	98	“ No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . ”
33147	33198	32858	32858	Elinor	89	“ Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life — your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? ”
33199	33229	32858	32858	Elinor	89	“ Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . ”
33230	33241	33243	33243	Elinor	89	“ Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , ”
33245	33253	33243	33243	Elinor	89	“ she is not at all altered . ”
33254	33267	32858	32858	Elinor	89	“ She is only grown a little more grave than she was . ”
33268	33273	33275	33275	Marianne	90	“ Nay , Edward , ”
33277	33293	33275	33275	Marianne	90	“ _ you _ need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself . ”
33294	33301	33303	33303	he	1018	“ Why should you think so ! ”
33309	33322	33303	33303	he	1018	“ But gaiety never was a part of _ my _ character . ”
33323	33335	33337	33337	Elinor	89	“ Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ’s , ”
33339	33379	33337	33337	Elinor	89	“ I should hardly call her a lively girl — she is very earnest , very eager in all she does — sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation — but she is not often really merry . ”
33380	33387	33303	33303	he	1018	“ I believe you are right , ”
33391	33405	33388	33388	he	1018	“ and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . ”
33406	33418	33420	33420	Elinor	89	“ I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , ”
33422	33497	33420	33420	Elinor	89	“ in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . ”
33498	33508	33510	33510	Marianne	90	“ But I thought it was right , Elinor , ”
33512	33551	33510	33510	Marianne	90	“ to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure . ”
33552	33632	33420	33420	Elinor	89	“ No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? ”
33633	33651	33653	33653	Edward	98	“ You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , ”
33657	33664	33653	33653	Edward	98	“ Do you gain no ground ? ”
33665	33670	33672	33672	Elinor	89	“ Quite the contrary , ”
33679	33683	33684	33684	he	1019	“ My judgment , ”
33687	33772	33684	33684	he	1019	“ is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister ’s . I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! ”
33773	33785	33787	33787	Elinor	89	“ Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , ”
33789	33801	33803	33803	Edward	98	“ She knows her own worth too well for false shame , ”
33805	33842	33803	33803	Edward	98	“ Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . ”
33843	33851	33853	33853	Marianne	90	“ But you would still be reserved , ”
33855	33861	33862	33862	Edward	98	“ and that is worse . ”
33863	33871	33926	33926	she	89	started—“Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ? ”
33872	33877	33926	33926	she	89	“ Yes , very . ”
33878	33885	33887	33887	he	1020	“ I do not understand you , ”
33891	33910	33887	33887	he	1020	“ Reserved!—how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? ”
33931	33972	33926	33926	she	89	“ Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? ”
34172	34184	34186	34186	he	1020	“ I am going into the village to see my horses , ”
34188	34205	34186	34186	he	1020	“ as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . ”
34309	34515	34303	34303	Edward	98	“ You must not enquire too far , Marianne — remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country — the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug — with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility — and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . ”
34516	34526	34528	34528	Marianne	90	“ I am afraid it is but too true , ”
34530	34539	34303	34303	Edward	98	“ but why should you boast of it ? ”
34540	34544	34546	34546	Elinor	89	“ I suspect , ”
34548	34616	34546	34546	Elinor	89	“ that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . ”
34617	34623	34625	34625	Marianne	90	“ It is very true , ”
34627	34703	34625	34625	Marianne	90	“ that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . ”
34704	34709	34711	34711	Edward	98	“ I am convinced , ”
34713	34844	34711	34711	Edward	98	“ that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower — and a troop of tidy , happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world . ”
34930	34942	34943	34943	she	90	“ I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , ”
34946	34973	34943	34943	she	90	“ Is that Fanny ’s hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . ”
35023	35046	35008	35008	He	1034	“ Yes ; it is my sister ’s hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . ”
35420	35432	35434	35434	he	99	“ You _ must _ drink tea with us to night , ”
35436	35461	35434	35434	he	99	“ for we shall be quite alone — and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . ”
35468	35479	35481	35481	she	103	“ And who knows but you may raise a dance , ”
35483	35495	35481	35481	she	103	“ And that will tempt _ you _ , Miss Marianne . ”
35496	35500	35502	35502	Marianne	90	“ A dance ! ”
35504	35512	35502	35502	Marianne	90	“ Impossible ! Who is to dance ? ”
35513	35545	35481	35481	she	103	“ Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.—What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! ”
35546	35554	35556	35557	Sir John	99	“ I wish with all my soul , ”
35559	35567	35556	35557	Sir John	99	“ that Willoughby were among us again . ”
35581	35587	35589	35589	he	99	“ And who is Willoughby ? ”
35665	35678	35652	35652	he	99	“ I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? ”
35679	35685	35652	35652	he	99	“ What do you mean ? ”
35686	35692	35652	35652	he	99	“ Shall I tell you ? ”
35693	35696	35652	35652	he	99	“ Certainly . ”
35697	35708	35709	35709	Marianne	90	“ Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . ”
35738	35761	35716	35716	she	90	“ Oh , Edward ! How can you?—But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . ”
35762	35769	35771	35771	he	99	“ I do not doubt it , ”
36355	36361	36363	36364	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ I think , Edward , ”
36375	36456	36363	36364	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it — you would not be able to give them so much of your time . But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least — you would know where to go when you left them . ”
36457	36463	36464	36464	he	1062	“ I do assure you , ”
36467	36780	36464	36464	he	1062	“ that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it — and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . ”
36781	36793	36795	36796	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , ”
36798	36830	36795	36796	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella ’s . ”
36831	36838	36840	36840	he	1063	“ They will be brought up , ”
36847	36870	36840	36840	he	1063	“ to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing . ”
36871	37009	36795	36796	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience — or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ? ”
37010	37014	37016	37016	Edward	98	“ I think , ”
37018	37032	37016	37016	Edward	98	“ that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . ”
37716	37719	37721	37721	he	99	“ Well , ”
37723	37737	37721	37721	he	99	“ we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? ”
37738	37746	37782	37782	Elinor	89	“ Hush ! they will hear you . ”
37747	37780	37782	37782	Elinor	89	“ Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . ”
37805	37826	37799	37799	she	89	“ Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open . ”
37827	37835	37836	37836	They	1085	“ She is walking , I believe . ”
37871	37998	37864	37864	She	103	“ How do you do , my dear ? How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you . Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again — ”
38293	38378	38379	38380	Mr. Palmer	129	“ Well ! what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mama , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma’am ! ( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? ”
38397	38405	38407	38407	she	128	“ Mr. Palmer does not hear me , ”
38411	38422	38407	38407	she	128	“ he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous ! ”
38530	38543	38545	38546	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ You may believe how glad we all were to see them , ”
38582	38669	38561	38561	she	103	“ but , however , I ca n’t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! ”
38684	38693	38695	38696	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ She expects to be confined in February , ”
38725	38732	38733	38733	he	129	“ No , none at all , ”
38740	38745	38747	38748	Sir John	99	“ Here comes Marianne , ”
38750	38763	38764	38764	He	129	“ Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . ”
38864	38903	38857	38857	She	128	“ Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . ”
38951	38960	38962	38963	his wife	280	“ My love , have you been asleep ? ”
39175	39182	39184	39184	Marianne	90	“ Why should they ask us ? ”
39193	39235	39184	39184	Marianne	90	“ The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . ”
39236	39250	39252	39252	Elinor	89	“ They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , ”
39254	39297	39252	39252	Elinor	89	“ by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . ”
39358	39367	39369	39369	she	128	“ I am so glad to see you ! ”
39378	39499	39369	39369	she	128	“ for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton . He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope . ”
39512	39518	39520	39521	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ Not go to town ! ”
39527	39596	39520	39521	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ I shall be quite disappointed if you do not . I could get the nicest house in the world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public . ”
39610	39616	39618	39619	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ Oh , my love , ”
39629	39645	39646	39646	Her	128	room—“you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter . ”
39666	39673	39675	39675	he	319	“ How horrid all this is ! ”
39677	39744	39675	39675	he	319	“ Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . It makes one detest all one ’s acquaintance . What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house ? How few people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather . ”
39754	39762	39764	39765	Sir John	99	“ I am afraid , Miss Marianne , ”
39767	39782	39764	39765	Sir John	99	“ you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . ”
39791	39802	39804	39805	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ Oh , do n’t be so sly before us , ”
39807	39860	39804	39805	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome . We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say . ”
39861	39866	39868	39869	her husband	319	“ Much nearer thirty , ”
39871	39899	39868	39869	her husband	319	“ Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place . ”
39900	39913	39915	39916	Mr. Palmer	129	“ As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life , ”
39934	39940	39942	39943	Mrs. Palmer—“then	132	“ Is it very ugly ? ”
39943	39957	39942	39943	Mrs. Palmer—“then	132	Palmer—“then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose . ”
39980	39984	39986	39986	he	99	“ My dear , ”
39991	40016	39986	39986	he	99	“ it is very provoking that we should be so few . Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? ”
40017	40049	39986	39986	he	99	“ Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? They dined with us last . ”
40050	40058	40060	40061	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ You and I , Sir John , ”
40063	40071	40060	40061	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ should not stand upon such ceremony . ”
40072	40082	40084	40085	Mr. Palmer	129	“ Then you would be very ill - bred , ”
40087	40095	40100	40100	her	280	“ My love you contradict every body , ”
40104	40114	40100	40100	her	280	“ Do you know that you are quite rude ? ”
40115	40132	40060	40061	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred . ”
40133	40144	40146	40151	the good - natured old lady	1135	“ Ay , you may abuse me as you please , ”
40153	40180	40146	40151	the good - natured old lady	1135	“ you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and can not give her back again . So there I have the whip hand of you . ”
40270	40277	40279	40279	she	127	“ Mr. Palmer is so droll ! ”
40288	40296	40279	40279	she	127	“ He is always out of humour . ”
40471	40479	40481	40482	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood , ”
40486	40542	40481	40482	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do,—and come while the Westons are with us . You can not think how happy I shall be ! It will be quite delightful!—My love , ”
40548	40562	40481	40482	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ do n’t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ? ”
40563	40566	40567	40567	he	319	“ Certainly , ”
40572	40581	40481	40482	Mrs. Palmer	128	sneer—“I came into Devonshire with no other view . ”
40582	40584	40481	40482	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ There now,”—said
40588	40604	40567	40567	he	319	“ you see Mr. Palmer expects you ; so you can not refuse to come . ”
40614	40723	40724	40724	Elinor	89	“ But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things . The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . ”
40741	40748	40750	40750	Charlotte	127	“ How charming it will be , ”
40752	40808	40750	40750	Charlotte	127	“ when he is in Parliament!—won’t it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.—But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he wo n’t . Do n’t you , Mr. Palmer ? ”
40817	40827	40828	40828	she	127	“ He can not bear writing , you know , ”
40829	40836	40750	40750	Charlotte	127	continued—“he says it is quite shocking . ”
40837	40840	40842	40842	he	129	“ No , ”
40844	40864	40842	40842	he	129	“ I never said any thing so irrational . Do n’t palm all your abuses of language upon me . ”
40865	40915	40916	40916	She	127	“ There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him ! Sometimes he wo n’t speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll — all about any thing in the world . ”
40942	40945	40947	40947	Elinor	89	“ Certainly , ”
40949	40955	40947	40947	Elinor	89	“ he seems very agreeable . ”
40956	41019	41020	41020	Elinor	89	“ Well — I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n’t think how disappointed he will be if you do n’t come to Cleveland.—I ca n’t imagine why you should object to it . ”
41134	41146	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well , ”
41149	41320	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	Palmer;—“Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before;—but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . ”
41321	41326	41328	41328	Elinor	89	“ Upon my word , ”
41330	41353	41328	41328	Elinor	89	“ you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . ”
41354	41386	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ Do n’t pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town . ”
41387	41393	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ My dear Mrs. Palmer ! ”
41394	41424	41328	41328	Elinor	89	“ Upon my honour I did.—I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . ”
41425	41477	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken . To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . ”
41478	41605	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ‘ So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . ’ ”
41606	41614	41328	41328	Elinor	89	“ And what did the Colonel say ? ”
41615	41663	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ Oh — he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ? ”
41664	41673	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? ”
41674	41699	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you . ”
41700	41721	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . ”
41722	41784	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ So do I. He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mama says _ he _ was in love with your sister too . I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . ”
41785	41797	41799	41799	Elinor	89	“ Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? ”
41801	41953	41799	41799	Elinor	89	“ Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I do n’t think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . ”
41980	41992	41148	41149	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	134	“ I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , ”
41994	42075	41799	41799	Elinor	89	Charlotte.—“And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You ca n’t think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts . ”
42076	42090	41799	41799	Elinor	89	“ You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? ”
42091	42117	42118	42118	she	1153	“ Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married . He was a particular friend of Sir John ’s . I believe , ”
42125	42182	42118	42118	she	1153	“ he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . ”
42183	42211	41799	41799	Elinor	89	“ Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John ’s proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ? ”
42212	42275	42118	42118	she	1153	“ Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . ”
42853	42858	42836	42837	philanthropic man	1185	“ Do come now , ”
42860	43024	42836	42837	philanthropic man	1185	he—“pray come — you must come — I declare you shall come — You ca n’t think how you will like them . Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance . And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . You will be delighted with them I am sure . They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . _ You _ are my cousins , and they are my wife ’s , so you must be related . ”
43468	43476	43478	43478	she	100	“ John is in such spirits today ! ”
43494	43501	43521	43521	she	100	window—“He is full of monkey tricks . ”
43525	43531	43521	43521	she	100	“ How playful William is ! ”
43532	43541	43542	43542	she	100	“ And here is my sweet little Annamaria , ”
43567	43586	43542	43542	she	100	“ And she is always so gentle and quiet — Never was there such a quiet little thing ! ”
43890	43895	43897	43898	Miss Steele	138	“ Poor little creatures ! ”
43907	43917	43897	43898	Miss Steele	138	“ It might have been a very sad accident . ”
43918	43925	43927	43927	Marianne	90	“ Yet I hardly know how , ”
43929	43960	43927	43927	Marianne	90	“ unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . ”
43961	43970	43972	43973	Lucy Steele	138	“ What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! ”
44044	44050	44052	44054	the elder sister	1219	“ And Sir John too , ”
44056	44064	44052	44054	the elder sister	1219	“ what a charming man he is ! ”
44097	44134	44085	44085	She	1219	“ And what a charming little family they have ! I never saw such fine children in my life.—I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children . ”
44135	44141	44143	44143	Elinor	89	“ I should guess so , ”
44149	44158	44143	44143	Elinor	89	“ from what I have witnessed this morning . ”
44159	44165	44167	44167	Lucy	138	“ I have a notion , ”
44169	44226	44167	44167	Lucy	138	“ you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . ”
44227	44231	44233	44233	Elinor	89	“ I confess , ”
44235	44256	44233	44233	Elinor	89	“ that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . ”
44287	44308	44269	44270	Miss Steele	138	“ And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . ”
44337	44349	44351	44352	Miss Steele	138	“ Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? ”
44354	44364	44366	44366	Lucy	138	“ We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , ”
44382	44393	44395	44395	Elinor	89	“ I think every one _ must _ admire it , ”
44397	44422	44395	44395	Elinor	89	“ who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . ”
44423	44461	44366	44366	Lucy	138	“ And had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . ”
44462	44469	44471	44471	Lucy	138	“ But why should you think , ”
44479	44494	44471	44471	Lucy	138	“ that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? ”
44495	44693	44366	44366	Lucy	138	“ Nay , my dear , I ’m sure I do n’t pretend to say that there an’t . I ’m sure there ’s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I ca n’t bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there ’s Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen . I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? ”
44694	44699	44701	44701	Elinor	89	“ Upon my word , ”
44703	44753	44701	44701	Elinor	89	“ I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . ”
44754	44776	44366	44366	Lucy	138	“ Oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men ’s being beaux — they have something else to do . ”
44777	44782	44814	44814	she	336	“ Lord ! Anne , ”
44787	44806	44814	44814	she	336	“ you can talk of nothing but beaux;—you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else . ”
45161	45178	45180	45180	she	89	“ ’ Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , ”
45182	45218	45180	45180	she	89	“ and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,—but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . ”
45436	45442	45444	45444	he	99	“ His name is Ferrars , ”
45452	45467	45444	45444	he	99	“ but pray do not tell it , for it ’s a great secret . ”
45468	45471	45473	45474	Miss Steele	138	“ Ferrars ! ”
45476	45516	45473	45474	Miss Steele	138	“ Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ? What ! your sister - in - law ’s brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . ”
45517	45526	45528	45528	Lucy	138	“ How can you say so , Anne ? ”
45542	45569	45528	45528	Lucy	138	“ Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle ’s , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . ”
45579	45596	45528	45528	Lucy	138	“ And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ? ”
46049	46063	46065	46065	Lucy	138	“ You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , ”
46081	46101	46102	46102	Elinor	89	cottage—“but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law ’s mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? ”
46131	46134	46136	46136	Lucy	138	“ Indeed ! ”
46138	46173	46136	46136	Lucy	138	“ I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? ”
46174	46177	46179	46179	Elinor	89	“ No , ”
46203	46210	46179	46179	Elinor	89	“ I know nothing of her . ”
46211	46230	46232	46232	Lucy	138	“ I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , ”
46241	46276	46277	46277	Elinor	89	“ but perhaps there may be reasons — I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . ”
46313	46421	46299	46299	Lucy	138	“ I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting _ you ; _ indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble _ you _ . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . ”
46422	46432	46434	46434	Elinor	89	“ I am sorry I do _ not _ , ”
46440	46492	46434	46434	Elinor	89	“ if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . ”
46493	46565	46566	46566	She	1255	“ I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present — but the time _ may _ come — how soon it will come must depend upon herself — when we may be very intimately connected . ”
46592	46596	46598	46598	Elinor	89	“ Good heavens ! ”
46600	46618	46598	46598	Elinor	89	“ what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? ”
46638	46641	46643	46643	Lucy	138	“ No , ”
46645	46664	46666	46666	her	138	“ not to Mr. _ Robert _ Ferrars — I never saw him in my life ; but , ”
46671	46677	46666	46666	her	138	“ to his eldest brother . ”
46755	46762	46764	46764	Lucy	138	“ You may well be surprised , ”
46766	46941	46764	46764	Lucy	138	“ for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . ”—She
46994	47005	46979	46979	she	89	solicitude—“May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? ”
47006	47015	46979	46979	she	89	“ We have been engaged these four years . ”
47016	47020	46979	46979	she	89	“ Four years ! ”
47021	47024	46979	46979	she	89	“ Yes . ”
47038	47044	47046	47046	she	89	“ I did not know , ”
47048	47059	47046	47046	she	89	“ that you were even acquainted till the other day . ”
47060	47087	46979	46979	she	89	“ Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle ’s care , you know , a considerable while . ”
47088	47092	46979	46979	she	89	“ Your uncle ! ”
47093	47109	46979	46979	she	89	“ Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? ”
47110	47116	47118	47118	Elinor	89	“ I think I have , ”
47134	47284	47118	47118	Elinor	89	“ He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been . Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . ”
47285	47288	47290	47290	Elinor	89	“ Certainly , ”
47322	47367	47305	47305	she	89	falsehood—“Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really — I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . ”
47368	47375	47377	47377	Lucy	138	“ We can mean no other , ”
47381	47442	47377	47377	Lucy	138	“ Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . ”
47443	47448	47450	47450	Elinor	89	“ It is strange , ”
47458	47471	47450	47450	Elinor	89	“ that I should never have heard him even mention your name . ”
47472	47552	47553	47553	She	1259	“ No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret . You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no _ occasion _ for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister ’s suspecting any thing , _ that _ was reason enough for his not mentioning it . ”
47571	47579	47581	47581	she	1259	“ Four years you have been engaged , ”
47587	47613	47581	47581	she	1259	“ Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . ”
47626	47680	47623	47623	she	1259	“ To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.—I have had it above these three years . ”
47744	47751	47753	47753	Lucy	138	“ I have never been able , ”
47755	47796	47753	47753	Lucy	138	“ to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . ”
47797	47805	47807	47807	Elinor	89	“ You are quite in the right , ”
47823	47828	47830	47830	she	89	“ I am sure , ”
47832	47895	47830	47830	she	89	“ I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . ”
47896	47905	47907	47907	Elinor	89	“ I certainly did not seek your confidence , ”
47909	47967	47907	47907	Elinor	89	“ but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . ”
48009	48025	48027	48027	she	89	“ I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , ”
48029	48292	48027	48027	she	89	“ in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward ’s mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t’other day , when Edward ’s name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You ca n’t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward ’s sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom — we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . ”
48308	48311	48313	48313	Lucy	138	“ Sometimes . ”
48320	48339	48345	48345	she	1261	“ I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . ”
48352	48438	48345	48345	she	1261	“ But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it . I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too — so dear as he is to me — I do n’t think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ? ”
48439	48443	48445	48445	Elinor	89	“ Pardon me , ”
48452	48471	48445	48445	Elinor	89	“ but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . ”
48472	48477	48479	48479	Lucy	138	“ To be sure , ”
48490	48553	48479	48479	Lucy	138	“ his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . ”
48554	48570	48445	48445	Elinor	89	“ Did he come from your uncle ’s , then , when he visited us ? ”
48571	48594	48479	48479	Lucy	138	“ Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? ”
48595	48598	48600	48600	Elinor	89	“ No , ”
48616	48636	48600	48600	Elinor	89	“ I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . ”
48668	48679	48681	48681	Lucy	138	“ Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? ”
48683	48696	48681	48681	Lucy	138	“ We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . ”
48697	48772	48649	48649	his	1263	“ I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected . Poor fellow ! I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; ”
48787	48833	48834	48834	Elinor	89	“ You know his hand , I dare say,—a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual . He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . ”
48951	48957	48959	48959	Lucy	138	“ Writing to each other , ”
48968	49065	48959	48959	Lucy	138	“ is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , _ I _ have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even _ that _ . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? ”
49066	49070	49072	49072	Elinor	89	“ I did , ”
51122	51127	51129	51130	Lady Middleton	100	“ I am glad , ”
51134	51192	51129	51130	Lady Middleton	100	“ you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria ’s basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . ”
51205	51275	51200	51200	herself	138	“ Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . ”
51276	51341	51342	51342	Lucy	138	“ You are very good , I hope it wo n’t hurt your eyes — will you ring the bell for some working candles ? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done . ”
51413	51448	51454	51454	she	90	“ Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse _ me_—you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned . ”
51483	51497	51499	51499	Elinor	89	“ Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma’am , ”
51508	51532	51499	51499	Elinor	89	“ and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . ”
51543	51546	51548	51548	Elinor	89	“ Perhaps , ”
51550	51625	51548	51548	Elinor	89	“ if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . ”
51626	51640	51642	51642	Lucy	138	“ Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , ”
51644	51676	51642	51642	Lucy	138	“ for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . ”
51677	51687	51689	51690	Miss Steele	138	“ Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed , ”
51692	51703	51689	51690	Miss Steele	138	“ Dear little soul , how I do love her ! ”
51704	51710	51712	51713	Lady Middleton	100	“ You are very kind , ”
51717	51749	51712	51713	Lady Middleton	100	“ and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? ”
51914	51956	51910	51910	Elinor	89	“ I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . ”
51957	51961	51963	51963	Lucy	138	“ Thank you , ”
51966	52001	51963	51963	Lucy	138	“ for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . ”
52002	52015	52017	52017	Elinor	89	“ Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , ”
52025	52059	52017	52017	Elinor	89	“ nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? ”
52060	52068	52070	52070	Lucy	138	“ And yet I do assure you , ”
52080	52199	52070	52070	Lucy	138	“ there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . ”
52200	52284	52017	52017	Elinor	89	“ Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . ”
52285	52416	52070	52070	Lucy	138	“ He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward ’s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . ”
52417	52478	52070	52070	Lucy	138	“ That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your ’s . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ’ engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . ”
52504	52511	52513	52513	Lucy	138	“ Edward ’s love for me , ”
52515	52578	52513	52513	Lucy	138	“ has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment ’s alarm on that account from the first . ”
52595	52736	52591	52591	Lucy	138	“ I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . ”
52737	52741	52743	52743	Elinor	89	“ All this , ”
52745	52759	52743	52743	Elinor	89	“ is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . ”
52760	52764	52766	52766	she	89	“ But what , ”
52772	52840	52766	52766	she	89	“ are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars ’s death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?—Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? ”
52841	52906	52743	52743	Elinor	89	“ If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward ’s sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . ”
52907	52924	52925	52925	Lucy	138	“ And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . ”
52935	52943	52945	52945	Elinor	89	“ Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? ”
52947	52973	52945	52945	Elinor	89	“ Not at all — I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother — silly and a great coxcomb . ”
52974	52979	52981	52982	Miss Steele	138	“ A great coxcomb ! ”
52999	53014	52981	52982	Miss Steele	138	“ Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . ”
53015	53019	53021	53021	Lucy	138	“ No sister , ”
53023	53039	53021	53021	Lucy	138	“ you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are _ not _ great coxcombs . ”
53040	53053	53055	53056	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood ’s is not , ”
53061	53102	53055	53056	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who _ she _ likes . ”
53103	53106	53108	53109	Miss Steele	138	“ Oh , ”
53117	53136	53108	53109	Miss Steele	138	“ I dare say Lucy ’s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood ’s . ”
53195	53360	53180	53180	Marianne	90	“ I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . ”
53361	53368	53370	53370	Elinor	89	“ I should always be happy , ”
53372	53419	53370	53370	Elinor	89	“ to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood—_that _ must be recommendation enough to her husband . ”
53420	53436	53180	53180	Marianne	90	“ But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward ’s going into orders . ”
53437	53450	53451	53451	They	1311	“ Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . ”
53468	53533	53461	53461	Lucy	138	“ I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? ”
53534	53537	53539	53539	Elinor	89	“ No , ”
53551	53585	53539	53539	Elinor	89	“ on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . ”
53586	53592	53594	53594	Lucy	138	“ Indeed you wrong me , ”
53600	53671	53594	53594	Lucy	138	“ I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ‘ I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ’ I should resolve upon doing it immediately . ”
53686	53730	53672	53672	Elinor	89	“ This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . ”
53731	53741	53743	53743	Lucy	138	“ ’ Tis because you are an indifferent person , ”
53758	53794	53743	53743	Lucy	138	“ that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . ”
53856	53868	53870	53870	she	138	“ Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? ”
53877	53881	53870	53870	she	138	“ Certainly not . ”
53882	53889	53891	53892	the other	772	“ I am sorry for that , ”
53902	53942	53891	53892	the other	772	“ it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . ”
53943	53959	53870	53870	she	138	“ It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . ”
53960	54035	53891	53892	the other	772	“ How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . ”
54582	54803	54567	54568	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I _ do _ beg you will favour me with your company , for I ’ve quite set my heart upon it . Do n’t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n’t put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford _ that _ . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n’t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . ”
54804	54810	54812	54813	Sir John	99	“ I have a notion , ”
54815	54888	54812	54813	Sir John	99	“ that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . ”
54889	54892	54894	54895	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Nay , ”
54897	55045	54894	54895	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne ’s company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my odd ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . ”
55046	55057	55059	55059	Marianne	90	“ I thank you , ma’am , sincerely thank you , ”
55064	55156	55059	55059	Marianne	90	“ your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,—I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence — Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . ”
55499	55507	55508	55508	she	88	“ I am delighted with the plan , ”
55511	55697	55508	55508	she	88	“ it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you _ should _ go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . ”
55698	55708	55710	55710	Elinor	89	“ Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , ”
55712	55746	55710	55710	Elinor	89	“ you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . ”
55752	55756	55758	55759	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ And what , ”
55761	55794	55758	55759	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do not let me hear a word about the expense of it . ”
55795	55832	55841	55842	her mother	332	“ My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings ’s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . ”
55833	55839	55841	55842	her mother	332	“ That is very true , ”
55844	55878	55841	55842	her mother	332	“ but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton . ”
55879	55892	55894	55894	Marianne	90	“ If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , ”
55896	55933	55894	55894	Marianne	90	“ at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . ”
56072	56082	56084	56085	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ I will have you _ both _ go , ”
56087	56151	56084	56085	Mrs. Dashwood	88	“ these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law ’s family . ”
56216	56262	56213	56213	she	89	“ I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . ”
57327	57337	57339	57339	Elinor	89	“ _ I _ am writing home , Marianne , ”
57341	57355	57339	57339	Elinor	89	“ had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? ”
57356	57369	57371	57371	Marianne	90	“ I am _ not _ going to write to my mother , ”
57757	57770	57751	57751	she	90	“ Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! ”
57895	57901	57903	57903	he	107	“ Is your sister ill ? ”
58085	58088	58089	58089	he	107	“ Yes , ”
58096	58127	58089	58089	he	107	“ almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . ”
58193	58198	58200	58200	she	103	“ Oh ! Colonel , ”
58208	58324	58200	58200	she	103	“ I am monstrous glad to see you — sorry I could not come before — beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with . Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? ”
58325	58344	58203	58203	her	103	“ I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer ’s , where I have been dining . ”
58345	58380	58203	58203	her	103	“ Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . ”
58381	58406	58200	58200	she	103	“ Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . ”
58407	58586	58587	58587	He	1410	“ Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see — that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too — which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome — worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I do n’t know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let ’s have no secrets among friends . ”
58809	58820	58822	58822	she	128	“ Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , ”
58824	58854	58822	58822	she	128	“ What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! ”
59159	59173	59175	59175	she	89	“ Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? ”
59193	59201	59202	59202	she	89	“ Are you quite sure of it ? ”
59205	59222	59223	59224	The man	502	“ Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? ”
59230	59235	59237	59237	she	89	“ How very odd ! ”
59254	59260	59264	59264	herself	89	“ How odd , indeed ! ”
59272	59376	59377	59377	She	89	“ If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! _ I _ long to inquire ; and how will _ my _ interference be borne . ”
59592	59601	59603	59604	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ If this open weather holds much longer , ”
59615	59661	59603	59604	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ’ tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day ’s pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . ”
59662	59667	59669	59669	Marianne	90	“ That is true , ”
59690	59710	59669	59669	Marianne	90	“ I had not thought of _ that _ . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . ”
59726	59737	59738	59738	she	90	“ It is charming weather for _ them _ indeed , ”
59754	59763	59738	59738	she	90	“ How much they must enjoy it ! But ”
59772	59843	59738	59738	she	90	“ it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer — nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! ”
59844	59849	59851	59851	Elinor	89	“ At any rate , ”
59870	59891	59856	59857	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . ”
59892	59912	59851	59851	Elinor	89	“ Ay , my dear , I ’ll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . ”
59913	59917	59920	59920	Elinor	89	“ And now , ”
59922	59934	59920	59920	Elinor	89	“ she will write to Combe by this day ’s post . ”
60076	60145	60146	60146	Elinor	89	“ Do n’t you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . ”
60457	60461	60463	60463	Marianne	90	“ Good God ! ”
60465	60475	60463	60463	Marianne	90	“ he has been here while we were out . ”
60493	60504	60476	60476	Elinor	89	“ Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . ”
60655	60659	60661	60661	Marianne	90	“ For me ! ”
60667	60676	60661	60661	Marianne	90	“ No , ma’am , for my mistress . ”
60688	60699	60678	60678	Marianne	90	“ It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! ”
60700	60709	60711	60711	Elinor	89	“ You are expecting a letter , then ? ”
60719	60728	60711	60711	Elinor	89	“ Yes , a little — not much . ”
60734	60744	60711	60711	Elinor	89	“ You have no confidence in me , Marianne . ”
60745	60762	60678	60678	Marianne	90	“ Nay , Elinor , this reproach from _ you_—you who have confidence in no one ! ”
60763	60766	60768	60768	Elinor	89	“ Me ! ”
60773	60784	60768	60768	Elinor	89	“ indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . ”
60785	60789	60791	60791	Marianne	90	“ Nor I , ”
60795	60828	60791	60791	Marianne	90	“ our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . ”
61329	61338	61340	61340	he	129	“ I thought you were both in Devonshire , ”
61342	61346	61348	61348	Elinor	89	“ Did you ? ”
61350	61358	61348	61348	Elinor	89	“ When do you go back again ? ”
61359	61365	61374	61374	Marianne	90	“ I do not know . ”
61410	61415	61417	61418	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Aye , aye , ”
61420	61476	61417	61418	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . ”
61477	61480	61482	61482	Marianne	90	“ Invited ! ”
61484	61506	61507	61507	Marianne	90	“ So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . ”
61840	61849	61893	61893	his	107	“ your sister looks unwell to - day , ”
61851	61859	61860	61860	he	107	“ your sister seems out of spirits , ”
61955	61968	61947	61947	He	107	“ your sister ’s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . ”
61969	61977	61979	61979	Elinor	89	“ It can not be generally known , ”
61981	61991	61992	61992	He	107	“ for her own family do not know it . ”
61998	62035	61992	61992	He	107	“ I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . ”
62036	62051	61952	61952	he	107	“ How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? ”
62052	62252	62264	62264	his	1486	“ By many — by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister ’s writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to — ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . ”
62488	62506	62476	62476	his	107	“ to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,”—took
63032	63036	63037	63037	she	89	“ Good heavens ! ”
63040	63067	63037	63037	she	89	“ he is there — he is there — Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not I speak to him ? ”
63068	63075	63077	63077	Elinor	89	“ Pray , pray be composed , ”
63079	63100	63077	63077	Elinor	89	“ and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . ”
63275	63303	63264	63264	she	89	“ Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ? ”
63363	63405	63358	63358	he	107	“ I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope . ”
63406	63415	63417	63417	Marianne	90	“ But have you not received my notes ? ”
63423	63461	63417	63417	Marianne	90	“ Here is some mistake I am sure — some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven ’s sake tell me , what is the matter ? ”
63513	63540	63504	63504	he	107	“ Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , ”
63598	63605	63606	63606	she	90	“ Go to him , Elinor , ”
63616	63669	63606	63606	she	90	“ and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again — must speak to him instantly.—I can not rest — I shall not have a moment ’s peace till this is explained — some dreadful misapprehension or other . Oh , go to him this moment . ”
63670	63700	63705	63705	she	90	“ How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations . Wait only till tomorrow . ”
64377	64385	64339	64339	Elinor	89	“ Marianne , may I ask — ? ”
64386	64391	64392	64392	she	89	“ No , Elinor , ”
64395	64405	64392	64392	she	89	“ ask nothing ; you will soon know all . ”
64880	64972	64877	64877	she	89	“ Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! _ My _ girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n’t keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? ”
65006	65085	64987	64987	herself	89	“ And have you really , Ma’am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister ’s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . ”
65086	65231	65279	65280	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Do n’t we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n’t do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . ”
65232	65237	65239	65239	Elinor	89	“ Indeed , Ma’am , ”
65244	65278	65239	65239	Elinor	89	“ you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . ”
65493	65503	65504	65504	I	0	“ Bond Street , January . MY DEAR MADAM , “
65753	65760	65761	65761	Your	90	“ I am , dear Madam , “
65764	65768	65769	65770	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	159	“ humble servant , “
65772	66372	65769	65770	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	159	” With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood , may be imagined . Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling — so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever — a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings ’s chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . Mrs. Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness . A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , “
66382	66383	66384	66384	I	0	” “
66388	66393	65769	65770	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	159	” replied her sister , “
66412	66441	66444	66444	Elinor	89	” This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , “
66452	66475	66444	66444	Elinor	89	” before her voice was entirely lost in sobs . Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . “
66482	66486	66477	66477	yourself	89	” she cried , “
66522	66523	66524	66524	I	0	” “
66532	66536	66524	66524	I	0	” cried Marianne ; “
66601	66602	66604	66604	you	89	” “
66633	66634	66619	66619	you	89	” “
66641	66651	66636	66636	me	0	” throwing her arms round her sister ’s neck ; “
66694	66695	66677	66677	Edward	98	” “
66701	66707	66677	66677	Edward	98	” said Elinor , solemnly . “
66714	66719	66720	66720	he	1540	” cried Marianne wildly , “
66736	66737	66728	66728	You	89	” “
66751	66752	66744	66744	I	0	” “
66771	66772	66761	66761	Mine	0	” “
66874	66875	66846	66846	he	1540	” “
66878	66882	66846	66846	he	1540	” cried Marianne , “
66889	66890	66846	66846	he	1540	” “
66894	66895	66898	66898	he	1540	” “
66916	66917	66908	66908	He	1540	” “
66927	66928	66919	66919	he	1540	” “
66959	66960	66948	66948	I	0	” “
66967	66968	66962	66962	you	89	” “
66987	67045	66982	66982	I	0	” Elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all . The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . “
67137	67139	67140	67140	Her	103	“ M.D. ”
67165	67341	67140	67140	Her	103	“ I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . We were last night at Lady Middleton ’s , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . “
67343	67356	67140	67140	Her	103	” The contents of her last note to him were these : — “
67640	67642	67622	67622	you	159	“ M.D. ”
67755	67760	67761	67761	she	89	“ I felt myself , ”
67764	67786	67761	67761	she	89	“ to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . ”
67787	67793	67795	67795	Elinor	89	“ I can believe it , ”
67797	67807	67761	67761	she	89	“ but unfortunately he did not feel the same . ”
67808	67956	67976	67976	she	1549	“ He _ did _ feel the same , Elinor — for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again — his distress — can I ever forget his distress ? ”
67984	67998	67976	67976	she	1549	“ Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . ”
67999	68015	67976	67976	she	1549	“ Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? ”
68016	68123	67976	67976	she	1549	“ By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes — whoever she be — or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ? ”
68133	68185	67976	67976	she	1549	“ Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . ”
68186	68191	68193	68193	Marianne	160	“ No , no , ”
68195	68280	68193	68193	Marianne	160	“ misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like — may resist insult , or return mortification — but I can not . I must feel — I must be wretched — and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . ”
68281	68291	67976	67976	she	1549	“ But for my mother ’s sake and mine — ”
68292	68319	67976	67976	she	1549	“ I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable — Oh ! who can require it ? ”
68401	68515	68363	68363	Marianne	160	“ It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel — nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me — ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ‘ The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me’—That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent!—Elinor , can he be justified ? ”
68516	68526	68771	68771	Elinor	89	“ No , Marianne , in no possible way . ”
68527	68589	68771	68771	Elinor	89	“ And yet this woman — who knows what her art may have been?—how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!—Who is she?—Who can she be?—Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?—Oh ! no one , no one — he talked to me only of myself . ”
68604	68628	68594	68594	Marianne	160	“ Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? ”
68629	68636	68771	68771	Elinor	89	“ To - morrow , Marianne ! ”
68637	68665	68771	68771	Elinor	89	“ Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby ’s sake — and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? ”
68666	68701	68771	68771	Elinor	89	“ It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . ”
68702	68770	68771	68771	Elinor	89	“ Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers — how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would _ he _ say to that ! ”
68920	68926	68927	68927	she	103	“ How do you do my dear?”—said
68947	69222	69223	69223	She	1554	“ How is she , Miss Dashwood ? Poor thing ! she looks very bad . No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon — a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men ’s going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n’t disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . ”
69274	69298	69299	69299	Elinor	89	“ no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . ”
69690	69694	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Poor soul ! ”
69706	69822	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things ! — ”
69823	69840	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ The lady then — Miss Grey I think you called her — is very rich ? ”
69841	70066	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n’t come before it ’s wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it do n’t signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why do n’t he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that wo n’t do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . ”
70067	70087	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? ”
70088	70149	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . ”
70150	70157	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ And who are the Ellisons ? ”
70158	70186	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made!—What now , ”
70190	70275	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	moment—“your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? ”
70276	70322	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Dear ma’am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . ”
70323	70508	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . ”
70509	70604	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . ”
70605	70730	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ’ tis blown over and forgot . And what good does talking ever do you know ? ”
70731	70802	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do _ this _ justice to Mr. Willoughby — he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . ”
70803	70842	69696	69697	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Law , my dear ! Do n’t pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! ”
70913	71304	70905	70905	her	103	“ Well , my dear , ’ tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an’t married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he ’ll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback — except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ’ prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ’ tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! ’ tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone ’s throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we _ can _ but put Willoughby out of her head ! ”
71305	71318	71320	71320	Elinor	89	“ Ay , if we can do _ that _ , Ma’am , ”
71322	71334	71320	71320	Elinor	89	“ we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . ”
71386	71393	71399	71400	her sister	336	“ You had better leave me , ”
71405	71411	71413	71413	Elinor	89	“ I will leave you , ”
71415	71423	71413	71413	Elinor	89	“ if you will go to bed . ”
71522	71526	71528	71528	she	103	“ My dear , ”
71532	71611	71528	71528	she	103	“ I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . ”
71612	71616	71618	71618	Elinor	89	“ Dear Ma’am , ”
71633	71686	71687	71688	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . ”
71845	71869	71828	71828	she	103	“ The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . ”
71899	71905	71907	71907	she	103	“ Marianne is not well , ”
71909	71927	71907	71907	she	103	“ She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . ”
71928	71933	71934	71934	he	104	“ Perhaps , then , ”
71938	71962	71934	71934	he	104	“ what I heard this morning may be — there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . ”
71963	71969	71907	71907	she	103	“ What did you hear ? ”
71970	72021	71907	71907	she	103	“ That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think — in short , that a man , whom I _ knew _ to be engaged — but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . ”
72022	72026	72028	72028	Elinor	89	“ You mean , ”
72034	72085	72028	72028	Elinor	89	“ Mr. Willoughby ’s marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we _ do _ know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? ”
72086	72301	71907	71907	she	103	“ In a stationer ’s shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey — it was no longer to be a secret — it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more:—as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment!—but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey ’s guardian . ”
72302	72333	72028	72028	Elinor	89	“ It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . ”
72334	72348	72028	72028	Elinor	89	“ It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable — at least I think”—he
72364	72373	72028	72028	Elinor	89	“ And your sister — how did she — ”
72374	72460	72028	72028	Elinor	89	“ Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps — but _ I _ am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . ”
72461	72464	72466	72467	Colonel Brandon	104	“ Ah ! ”
72469	72496	72466	72467	Colonel Brandon	104	“ there is , indeed ! But your sister does not — I think you said so — she does not consider quite as you do ? ”
72497	72517	72518	72518	He	104	“ You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . ”
72839	72851	72852	72852	she	90	“ No , no , no , it can not be , ”
72855	72893	72852	72852	she	90	“ she can not feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . ”
73108	73127	73101	73101	she	90	“ Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . ”
73713	73719	73721	73721	Elinor	89	“ Who can this be ? ”
73723	73737	73738	73738	Marianne	90	“ So early too ! I thought we _ had _ been safe . ”
73744	73750	73752	73752	she	89	“ It is Colonel Brandon ! ”
73757	73767	73752	73752	she	89	“ We are never safe from _ him _ . ”
73768	73782	73721	73721	Elinor	89	“ He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . ”
73783	73793	73752	73752	she	89	“ I will not trust to _ that _ , ”
73800	73823	73752	73752	she	89	“ A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . ”
73898	73907	73909	73909	he	104	“ I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , ”
73916	74081	74082	74082	He	1608	“ and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object — my wish — my sole wish in desiring it — I hope , I believe it is — is to be a means of giving comfort;—no , I must not say comfort — not present comfort — but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister ’s mind . My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother — will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a _ very _ sincere regard — nothing but an earnest desire of being useful — I think I am justified — though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ? ”
74085	74090	74092	74092	Elinor	89	“ I understand you , ”
74094	74164	74092	74092	Elinor	89	“ You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne . _ My _ gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and _ hers _ must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . ”
74165	74241	73909	73909	he	104	“ You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,—but this will give you no idea — I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it _ shall _ be a short one . On such a subject , ”
74245	74255	74256	74256	He	1609	“ can I have little temptation to be diffuse . ”
74273	74334	74256	74256	He	1609	“ You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation—(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)—a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park — it was the evening of a dance — in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . ”
74335	74338	74340	74340	Elinor	89	“ Indeed , ”
74342	74351	74352	74352	He	1609	“ I have _ not _ forgotten it . ”
74362	74976	74977	74977	he	1610	“ If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Hers , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married — married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing — but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin ’s maid betrayed us . I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father ’s point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one — but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon ’s , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps — but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , ”
74987	75029	74977	74977	he	1610	“ was of trifling weight — was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was _ that _ which threw this gloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered — ”
75104	75492	75494	75494	he	1612	“ It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I _ did _ arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I _ did _ find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , in the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered — so faded — worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her — but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it — I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was — yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . ”
75520	75532	75534	75534	he	1612	“ Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , ”
75536	76127	75534	75534	he	1612	“ by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood — a subject such as this — untouched for fourteen years — it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I _ will _ be more collected — more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter — better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter ’s being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too . ”
76128	76132	76134	76134	Elinor	89	“ Good heavens ! ”
76136	76144	76134	76134	Elinor	89	“ could it be — could Willoughby ! ”
76146	76156	76157	76157	he	1614	“ The first news that reached me of her , ”
76160	76378	76157	76157	he	1614	“ came in a letter from herself , last October . It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but _ had _ he known it , what would it have availed ? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ? No , he had already done that , which no man who _ can _ feel for another would do . He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her . ”
76379	76386	76388	76388	Elinor	89	“ This is beyond every thing ! ”
76390	76807	76388	76388	Elinor	89	“ His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it _ was _ known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister — but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister ’s influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless _ will _ turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . ”
76839	76846	76848	76848	she	89	“ I have been more pained , ”
76850	76902	76903	76903	she	89	“ by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , ”
76911	76923	76903	76903	she	89	“ ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? ”
76924	76927	76928	76928	he	1615	“ Yes , ”
76932	76942	76928	76928	he	1615	“ once I have . One meeting was unavoidable . ”
76957	76966	76943	76943	Elinor	89	“ What ? have you met him to — ”
76967	77036	77037	77037	Elinor	89	“ I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . ”
77060	77063	77065	77066	Colonel Brandon	104	“ Such , ”
77072	77095	77065	77066	Colonel Brandon	104	“ has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! ”
77096	77103	77148	77148	he	104	“ Is she still in town ? ”
77104	77141	77148	77148	he	104	“ No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . ”
78238	78373	78374	78375	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly ’s puppies ! and this was the end of it ! ”
78385	78476	78374	78375	Mrs. Palmer	128	“ She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . ”
78703	78711	78680	78680	her	100	“ It is very shocking , indeed ! ”
79401	79419	79421	79421	she	89	“ I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here _ still _ , ”
79432	79551	79421	79421	she	89	“ But I always thought I _ should _ . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you _ told _ me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a _ month _ . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no _ hurry _ to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to _ your word _ . ”
79578	79584	79586	79587	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Well , my dear , ”
79589	79596	79586	79587	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ and how did you travel ? ”
79597	79607	79609	79610	Miss Steele	138	“ Not in the stage , I assure you , ”
79616	79672	79609	79610	Miss Steele	138	“ we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we ’d join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . ”
79673	79678	79680	79681	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Oh , oh ! ”
79683	79701	79680	79681	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . ”
79702	79706	79708	79709	Miss Steele	138	“ There now , ”
79714	79814	79708	79709	Miss Steele	138	“ everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour ’s end to another . ‘ Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ’ my cousin said t’other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I — I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . ”
79815	79841	79849	79850	her cousin	1677	“ Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking — but it wo n’t do — the Doctor is the man , I see . ”
79842	79847	79849	79850	her cousin	1677	“ No , indeed ! ”
79856	79873	79849	79850	her cousin	1677	“ and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . ”
79898	79921	79923	79923	Lucy	138	“ I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , ”
79938	79948	79923	79923	Lucy	138	“ No , I do not think we shall . ”
79949	79960	79961	79961	Elinor	89	“ Oh , yes , I dare say you will . ”
79970	79991	79961	79961	Elinor	89	“ What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! ”
79992	79999	80001	80002	Mrs. Jennings	103	“ Long a time , indeed ! ”
80004	80014	80015	80015	Lucy	138	“ Why , their visit is but just begun ! ”
80019	80033	80035	80036	Miss Steele	138	“ I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , ”
80038	80047	80035	80036	Miss Steele	138	“ I am sorry she is not well — ”
80058	80101	80049	80049	Marianne	90	“ You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . ”
80102	80140	80141	80141	Elinor	89	“ Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!—I think she might see _ us ; _ and I am sure we would not speak a word . ”
80176	80184	80186	80187	Miss Steele	138	“ Oh , if that ’s all , ”
80189	80202	80186	80187	Miss Steele	138	“ we can just as well go and see _ her _ . ”
80919	80930	80932	80932	he	1697	“ I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , ”
80934	81102	80932	80932	he	1697	“ but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . _ This _ morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to _ them _ . As my mother - in - law ’s relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . ”
81103	81126	81251	81251	Elinor	89	“ Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . ”
81127	81250	81251	81251	Elinor	89	“ I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . ”
81362	81384	81341	81341	He	339	“ but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . ”
81551	81564	81547	81547	his	339	“ Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ? ”
81565	81576	81505	81505	he	339	“ Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . ”
81577	81612	81670	81670	himself	1714	“ I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . ”
81613	81623	81679	81679	he	1714	“ Me , brother ! what do you mean ? ”
81624	81648	81679	81679	he	1714	“ He likes you . I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ? ”
81649	81658	81679	81679	he	1714	“ I believe about two thousand a year . ”
81659	81666	81679	81679	he	1714	“ Two thousand a - year ; ”
81682	81703	81679	81679	he	1714	“ Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were _ twice _ as much , for your sake . ”
81704	81710	81712	81712	Elinor	89	“ Indeed I believe you , ”
81714	81734	81712	81712	Elinor	89	“ but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _ me _ . ”
81735	81920	81921	81921	his	1715	“ You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side — in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable — you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that”—lowering
81926	81936	81942	81942	he	1715	whisper—“will be exceedingly welcome to _ all parties _ . ”
81945	82016	81942	81942	he	1715	“ That is , I mean to say — your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . ”
82024	82033	82034	82034	he	1715	“ It would be something remarkable , now , ”
82037	82065	82034	82034	he	1715	“ something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . ”
82066	82072	82074	82074	Elinor	89	“ Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , ”
82079	82085	82074	82074	Elinor	89	“ going to be married ? ”
82086	82277	82278	82278	He	1716	“ It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality:—The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny ’s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . ”
82293	82314	82287	82287	she	1717	“ Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . ”
82315	82468	82074	82074	Elinor	89	“ Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it _ has _ cost me a vast deal of money . ”
82469	82480	82278	82278	He	1716	“ More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . ”
82481	82561	82562	82562	Elinor	89	“ Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker ’s hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . ”
82567	82699	82562	82562	Elinor	89	“ Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars ’s kindness is . ”
82700	82703	82705	82705	Elinor	89	“ Certainly , ”
82707	82726	82705	82705	Elinor	89	“ and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . ”
82727	82738	82739	82739	he	1718	“ Another year or two may do much towards it , ”
82743	82782	82739	82739	he	1718	“ but however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny ’s green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . ”
82783	82793	82705	82705	Elinor	89	“ Where is the green - house to be ? ”
82794	82863	82864	82864	Elinor	89	“ Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . ”
82949	83048	82935	82935	he	1718	“ She seems a most valuable woman indeed . Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous . Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten . She must have a great deal to leave . ”
83049	83073	82935	82935	he	1718	“ Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . ”
83074	83113	82935	82935	he	1718	“ But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do _ that _ and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . ”
83114	83136	82935	82935	he	1718	“ And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? ”
83137	83230	82935	82935	he	1718	“ Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . ”
83231	83257	82935	82935	he	1718	“ But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . ”
83258	83265	83267	83267	he	1722	“ Why , to be sure , ”
83274	83317	83267	83267	he	1722	“ people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne?—she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ? ”
83318	83336	82935	82935	he	1718	“ She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks . ”
83337	83539	83540	83540	Elinor	89	“ I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! Hers has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of _ you _ , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne _ now _ , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if _ you _ do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . ”
83736	83748	83750	83750	he	85	“ I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , ”
83760	83902	83750	83750	he	85	“ Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting _ her _ , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . ”
84983	84991	84993	84993	Lucy	138	“ Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! ”
85022	85067	85068	85068	Elinor	89	time:—“there is nobody here but you , that can feel for me . I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious ! In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on — that is to be my mother ! ”
86080	86089	86091	86091	he	104	“ These are done by my eldest sister , ”
86093	86142	86091	86091	he	104	“ and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . ”
86246	86247	86248	86250	Mrs. Ferrars—“very pretty,”—and	184	“ Hum”—said
86249	86250	86248	86250	Mrs. Ferrars—“very pretty,”—and	184	Ferrars—“very pretty,”—and
86286	86297	86282	86282	she	93	“ They are very pretty , ma’am — an’t they ? ”
86324	86353	86320	86320	she	93	“ Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton ’s style of painting , Ma’am?—_She does _ paint most delightfully!—How beautifully her last landscape is done ! ”
86354	86367	86368	86368	Marianne	90	“ Beautifully indeed ! But _ she _ does every thing well . ”
86417	86450	86396	86396	she	93	“ This is admiration of a very particular kind!—what is Miss Morton to us?—who knows , or who cares , for her?—it is Elinor of whom _ we _ think and speak . ”
86503	86512	86489	86489	herself	93	“ Miss Morton is Lord Morton ’s daughter . ”
86687	86708	86709	86709	She	98	“ Dear , dear Elinor , do n’t mind them . Do n’t let them make _ you _ unhappy . ”
86767	86773	86761	86761	Jennings	103	“ Ah ! poor dear , ”
86866	86870	86872	86873	her brother	339	“ Poor Marianne ! ”
86892	86971	86886	86886	he	339	“ She has not such good health as her sister,—she is very nervous,—she has not Elinor ’s constitution;—and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who _ has been _ a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne _ was _ remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor . Now you see it is all gone . ”
87297	87302	87304	87304	Lucy	138	“ My dear friend , ”
87314	87410	87304	87304	Lucy	138	“ I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars ’s way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was ! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ; but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so ? You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? ”
87411	87420	87507	87507	she	89	“ She was certainly very civil to you . ”
87421	87463	87464	87464	Elinor	89	“ Civil!—Did you see nothing but only civility?—I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!—No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same — all sweetness and affability ! ”
87495	87505	87507	87507	she	89	“ Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , ”
87509	87527	87507	87507	she	89	“ nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;—but as that was not the case — ”
87528	87534	87535	87535	Lucy	138	“ I guessed you would say so,”—replied
87536	87634	87507	87507	she	89	quickly—“but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You sha n’t talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed!—I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! ”
87650	87668	87637	87637	Elinor	89	“ Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?—you seem low — you do n’t speak;—sure you an’t well . ”
87669	87677	87535	87535	Lucy	138	“ I never was in better health . ”
87678	87731	87732	87732	Elinor	89	“ I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have _ you _ ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!—Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . ”
87758	87902	87754	87754	she	138	“ Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward ’s love , it is the greatest comfort I have . Poor Edward ! But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton ’s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister — besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;—and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me . They are such charming women!—I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . ”
87925	88036	87922	87922	Lucy	138	“ I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way — you know what I mean — if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she _ does _ dislike , I know it is most violent . ”
88660	88664	88665	88665	she	89	“ Dear Edward ! ”
88668	88684	88665	88665	she	89	“ this is a moment of great happiness!—This would almost make amends for every thing ! ”
88790	88799	88800	88800	she	89	“ Oh , do n’t think of me ! ”
88817	88842	88800	88800	she	89	“ do n’t think of _ my _ health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . ”
88876	88882	88884	88884	Edward	94	“ Do you like London ? ”
88897	88941	88942	88942	She	89	“ Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! ”
88949	88955	88956	88956	she	89	“ I think , Elinor , ”
88960	89006	88956	88956	she	89	“ we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . ”
89055	89093	89100	89100	she	90	“ We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull!—But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . ”
89132	89146	89100	89100	she	90	“ But why were you not there , Edward?—Why did you not come ? ”
89147	89153	89105	89105	her	90	“ I was engaged elsewhere . ”
89154	89170	89100	89100	she	90	“ Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? ”
89171	89177	89179	89179	Lucy	138	“ Perhaps , Miss Marianne , ”
89189	89214	89179	89179	Lucy	138	“ you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . ”
89234	89371	89230	89230	she	90	“ Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he _ has _ the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . ”
89420	89425	89427	89427	Marianne	90	“ Going so soon ! ”
89429	89439	89427	89427	Marianne	90	“ my dear Edward , this must not be . ”
89491	89500	89502	89502	Marianne	90	“ What can bring her here so often ? ”
89509	89523	89502	89502	Marianne	90	“ Could not she see that we wanted her gone!—how teazing to Edward ! ”
89524	89560	89561	89561	Marianne	90	“ Why so?—we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . ”
89570	89642	89561	89561	Marianne	90	“ You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . ”
91201	91222	91192	91192	she	90	“ her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . ”
91757	91762	91763	91763	he	144	“ Upon my soul , ”
91766	91908	91763	91763	he	144	“ I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ‘ My dear Madam , ’ I always say to her , ‘ you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt ’s , all this would have been prevented . ’ This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . ”

91962	91969	91970	91970	Elinor	89	“ in a cottage near Dawlish . ”
92010	92016	92018	92018	he	1936	“ For my own part , ”
92020	92193	92018	92018	he	1936	“ I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . And I protest , if I had any money to spare , I should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of London , where I might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi ’s . I was to decide on the best of them . ‘ My dear Courtland , ’ said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ‘ do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage . ’ And that I fancy , will be the end of it . “
92432	92588	92589	92589	I	0	” Elinor agreed to it all , for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition . As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister , his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else ; and a thought struck him during the evening , which he communicated to his wife , for her approbation , when they got home . The consideration of Mrs. Dennison ’s mistake , in supposing his sisters their guests , had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such , while Mrs. Jennings ’s engagements kept her from home . The expense would be nothing , the inconvenience not more ; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father . Fanny was startled at the proposal . “
92599	92603	92589	92589	I	0	” said she , “
92668	92686	92661	92661	I	0	” Her husband , but with great humility , did not see the force of her objection . “
92720	92735	92736	92737	My love	2785	” Fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said , “
92868	93495	93496	93496	Lord	1972	” Mr. Dashwood was convinced . He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately , and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year ; at the same time , however , slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless , by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon ’s wife , and Marianne as _ their _ visitor . Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister ’s , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them . This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy . Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her , herself ; cherishing all her hopes , and promoting all her views ! Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was , above all things , the most material to her interest , and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings ! It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged , nor too speedily made use of ; and the visit to Lady Middleton , which had not before had any precise limits , was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days ’ time . When the note was shown to Elinor , as it was within ten minutes after its arrival , it gave her , for the first time , some share in the expectations of Lucy ; for such a mark of uncommon kindness , vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance , seemed to declare that the good - will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself ; and might be brought , by time and address , to do every thing that Lucy wished . Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton , and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood ; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater . The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street , and all that reached Elinor of their influence there , strengthened her expectation of the event . Sir John , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking . Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them . END OF THE SECOND VOLUME CHAPTER XXXVII . Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , “
93509	93510	93504	93504	you	84	” “
93519	93520	93513	93513	ma’am	2974	” “
93807	93808	93799	93800	Mrs. Dashwood	88	” “
93815	93816	93821	93821	I	0	” “
94789	95552	95565	95565	he	2036	” Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it . She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy . What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself . For _ him _ she felt much compassion;—for Lucy very little — and it cost her some pains to procure that little;—for the rest of the party none at all . As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion . No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor ’s office was a painful one.—She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister ’s chief consolation,—to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to _ her _ fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it . She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward ’s engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief . _ That _ belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively . Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she _ had _ loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself ! As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.—Marianne ’s feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment . The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , — “
95570	95571	95565	95565	he	2036	” “
95599	95626	95590	95590	she	138	” At these words , Marianne ’s eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter . After a pause of wonder , she exclaimed — “
95636	95641	95629	95629	you	2035	” Elinor confirmed it . “
95668	95669	95660	95660	I	0	” “
95686	95687	95683	95684	the reverse	2037	” “
95691	95696	95683	95684	the reverse	2037	” cried Marianne again . “
95709	95710	95705	95705	you	2035	” “
95777	95783	95784	95784	I	0	” Marianne seemed much struck . “
95796	95800	95784	95784	I	0	” added Elinor ; “
95821	95822	95814	95814	I	0	” “
95832	95833	95828	95828	you	2041	” “
96099	96100	96104	96104	your	2050	” “
96109	96113	96104	96104	your	2050	” said Marianne , “
96159	96160	96161	96161	I	0	” “
96542	96548	96535	96535	I	0	” Marianne was quite subdued . “
96553	96557	96558	96558	you	89	” she cried , “
96626	96784	96617	96617	I	0	” The tenderest caresses followed this confession . In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ; to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ; and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality . These were great concessions ; but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.—She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three times to say , “
96789	96879	96617	96617	I	0	”—She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward ’s affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.—Such advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself . The next morning brought a farther trial of it , in a visit from their brother , who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair , and bring them news of his wife . “
96887	96901	96884	96884	I	0	” said he with great solemnity , as soon as he was seated , “
96915	96931	96932	96932	Your	2062	” They all looked their assent ; it seemed too awful a moment for speech . “
96935	96939	96932	96932	Your	2062	” he continued , “
97189	97205	97173	97173	her	0	” Here he stopped to be thanked ; which being done , he went on . “
97556	97574	97542	97542	she	270	” Here Marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , “
97583	97584	97542	97542	she	270	” “
97592	97597	97587	97587	you	270	” replied her brother , “
97615	97631	97609	97609	Your	90	” Marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore . “
97637	97641	97654	97654	he	2062	” he continued , “
97688	97689	97676	97676	He	2062	” “
97692	97707	97676	97676	He	2062	” cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , “
97784	97824	97825	97825	I	0	” John Dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune . He therefore replied , without any resentment , “
97992	98027	97978	97978	his	2088	” Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and Elinor ’s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward , while braving his mother ’s threats , for a woman who could not reward him . “
98032	98037	97978	97978	his	2088	” said Mrs. Jennings , “
98044	98045	98046	98046	I	0	” “
98105	98106	98096	98096	we	2100	” “
98117	98118	98107	98109	Poor young man!—and	2101	” “
98242	98243	98244	98246	Poor young man	2104	” “
98248	98253	98244	98246	Poor young man	2104	” cried Mrs. Jennings , “
98303	98327	98275	98275	him	2088	” Elinor ’s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it . “
98339	98344	98337	98337	himself	2088	” said John Dashwood , “
98455	98456	98441	98441	I	0	” “
98459	98464	98441	98441	I	0	” said Mrs. Jennings , “
98501	98511	98485	98485	mine	0	” Marianne got up and walked about the room . “
98524	98528	98521	98522	a man	499	” continued John , “
98556	99298	98550	98550	I	0	” A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion , concluded his visit ; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny ’s indisposition , and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it , he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars ’s conduct , the Dashwoods ’ , and Edward ’s . Marianne ’s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party . CHAPTER XXXVIII . Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward ’s conduct , but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit . _ They _ only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient , and how small was the consolation , beyond the consciousness of doing right , that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune . Elinor gloried in his integrity ; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment . But though confidence between them was , by this public discovery , restored to its proper state , it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone . Elinor avoided it upon principle , as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts , by the too warm , too positive assurances of Marianne , that belief of Edward ’s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away ; and Marianne ’s courage soon failed her , in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever , by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor ’s conduct and her own . She felt all the force of that comparison ; but not as her sister had hoped , to urge her to exertion now ; she felt it with all the pain of continual self - reproach , regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before ; but it brought only the torture of penitence , without the hope of amendment . Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more . Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett ’s Buildings . But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time . The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens , though it was only the second week in March . Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number ; but Marianne , who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place . An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all Mrs. Jennings ’s conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection . She saw nothing of the Willoughbys , nothing of Edward , and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay , be interesting to her . But at last she found herself with some surprise , accosted by Miss Steele , who , though looking rather shy , expressed great satisfaction in meeting them , and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings , left her own party for a short time , to join their ’s . Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor , “
99328	99365	99325	99326	Mrs. Clarke	199	” It was lucky , however , for Mrs. Jennings ’s curiosity and Elinor ’s too , that she would tell any thing _ without _ being asked ; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt . “
99374	99384	99325	99326	Mrs. Clarke	199	” said Miss Steele , taking her familiarly by the arm—“for
99397	99404	99389	99389	you	2750	” And then lowering her voice , “
99419	99420	99416	99416	she	2116	” “
99431	99432	99429	99429	you	0	” “
99449	99450	99440	99441	Lady Middleton	100	” “
99462	99463	99464	99464	I	0	” “
99654	99686	99640	99640	I	0	” She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first . “
99693	99697	99698	99698	people	2770	” speaking triumphantly , “
99768	99769	99749	99749	herself	138	” “
99786	99790	99782	99782	I	0	” said Elinor . “
100566	100567	100568	100568	I	0	” “
100579	100583	100573	100573	you	0	” said Elinor ; “
100597	100598	100595	100595	you	0	” “
100666	100667	100656	100656	I	0	” “
100670	100674	100676	100676	you	0	” cried Elinor ; “
100736	100737	100728	100728	you	0	” “
100821	100851	100852	100852	Edward	98	” Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind . “
100860	100864	100852	100852	Edward	98	” said she ; “
101140	101141	101112	101112	I	0	” “
101144	101148	101112	101112	I	0	” said Elinor , “
101167	101191	101160	101160	You	2174	” Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary . “
101381	101616	101372	101372	you	2174	” Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind . Edward ’s marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be;—every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance . As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark . “
101757	101780	101781	101781	Bartlett	182	” The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself . It was as follows : “
101787	102226	101781	101781	Bartlett	182	“ I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another ’s love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother ’s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.—Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n’t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ’ twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.—My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , “
102232	102276	102281	102281	she	2195	” As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer ’s real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise . “
102411	102703	102403	102403	Lucy	138	” CHAPTER XXXIX . The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne ’s impatience to be gone increased every day . She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it . Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs. Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them . This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;—but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . “
102704	102711	102769	102769	Elinor	89	Cleveland!”—she cried , with great agitation . “
102721	102722	102723	102723	You	0	” “
102726	102731	102723	102723	You	0	” said Elinor gently , “
102747	102748	102723	102723	You	0	” “
102780	103036	102769	102769	Elinor	89	” Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;—she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;—represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day ’s journey ; and their mother ’s servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ’ time . As Marianne ’s affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started . Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland . Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother ’s concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;—and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . “
103054	103073	103074	103074	they	2201	Dashwoods;”—was Mrs. Jennings ’s address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled—“for
103109	103449	103450	103450	I	0	” Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it ; and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor ’s moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might _ not _ hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment . Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne ’s turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel ’s inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . This set the matter beyond a doubt . She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think _ that _ any material objection ; and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne ’s performance brought her these words in the Colonel ’s calm voice , — “
103461	103481	103482	103482	Lord	2204	” Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , “
103487	103499	103482	103482	Lord	2204	it?”—but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . “
103512	103573	103574	103574	I	0	” This delay on the Colonel ’s side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which showed her to feel what she said , “
103585	103664	103665	103665	I	0	” Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost _ sang - froid _ , and go away without making her any reply ! She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . “
103669	103677	103665	103665	I	0	” said he , with great compassion , “
103730	103738	103720	103720	I	0	” Elinor told him that it was . “
103746	103754	103781	103781	she	98	” he replied , with great feeling , “
104021	104413	104017	104017	him	144	” Elinor ’s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand . The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry ; and _ she _ , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it ! Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause ; but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed . She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward ’s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself . It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from _ her _ , she would have been very glad to be spared herself ; but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition . Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele . She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day . After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and _ then _ it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent ; an evil which Elinor , as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size . “
104420	104424	104017	104017	him	144	” said she , “
104446	104507	104508	104510	This little rectory	2220	” By which the Colonel was surprised to find that _ she _ was considering Mr. Ferrars ’s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on , and he said so . “
104663	104743	104746	104747	Miss Dashwood	84	” Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage . CHAPTER XL . “
104749	104765	104746	104747	Miss Dashwood	84	” said Mrs. Jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , “
104833	104834	104822	104822	I	0	” “
104840	104844	104836	104836	you	84	” said Elinor . “
104899	104900	104901	104901	Lord	1972	” “
104938	104939	104940	104940	You	84	” “
104968	104969	104955	104955	you	84	” “
104972	104975	104955	104955	you	84	” repeated Mrs. Jennings—“Oh
105044	105045	105046	105046	You	84	” “
105057	105066	105054	105054	I	0	” said Elinor , with a faint smile . “
105111	105112	105113	105113	He	664	” “
105122	105123	105113	105113	He	664	” “
105144	105174	105142	105142	himself	664	” They were interrupted by the servant ’s coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to go , said , — “
105255	105266	105244	105244	you	2750	” Marianne had left the room before the conversation began . “
105291	105292	105279	105279	I	0	” “
105298	105305	105279	105279	I	0	” said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed . “
105330	105331	105318	105318	I	0	” “
105410	105461	105466	105466	you	2974	” This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly . Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend . A few moments ’ reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ; — “
105538	105569	105532	105532	he	144	” Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings ’s speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion . “
105594	105595	105579	105579	he	104	” “
105665	105678	105679	105679	I	0	” And away she went ; but returning again in a moment , “
105750	105751	105740	105740	you	2750	” “
105756	106117	106118	106119	Mrs. Jennings	103	” replied Elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject . How she should begin — how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern . The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her hand , till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself . He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business . Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance . She had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes . He too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.—Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair . “
106123	106127	106118	106119	Mrs. Jennings	103	” said he , “
106211	106212	106213	106213	You	103	” “
106221	106243	106270	106270	she	103	” said Elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , “
106435	106493	106494	106495	Colonel Brandon	104	” What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . He _ looked _ all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , — “
106497	106498	106494	106495	Colonel Brandon	104	” “
106501	106517	106494	106495	Colonel Brandon	104	” continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , “
106594	106595	106596	106597	Colonel Brandon	104	” “
106608	106609	106596	106597	Colonel Brandon	104	” “
106626	106627	106596	106597	Colonel Brandon	104	” “
106630	106638	106596	106597	Colonel Brandon	104	” replied he , with sudden consciousness , “
106689	106690	106691	106691	You	103	” “
106813	106896	106897	106898	Colonel Brandon	104	” Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it . For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;—at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , “
106942	106943	106927	106927	He	104	” “
106946	106950	106927	106927	He	104	” replied Elinor , “
107010	107061	107062	107063	Colonel Brandon	104	” Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . “
107074	107095	107062	107063	Colonel Brandon	104	” said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair . Elinor told him the number of the house . “
107135	107199	107123	107123	he	104	” Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on _ her _ side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on _ his _ , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it . “
107206	107219	107201	107201	I	0	” said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , “
107229	107334	107201	107201	I	0	” And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent . When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared . “
107340	107344	107201	107201	I	0	” she cried , “
107378	107379	107366	107366	You	2750	” “
107392	107393	107366	107366	You	2750	” “
107411	107412	107382	107382	ma’am	2974	” “
107415	107419	107382	107382	ma’am	2974	” said Elinor , “
107458	107459	107447	107447	I	0	” “
107465	107470	107471	107471	Lord	2282	” cried Mrs. Jennings ; “
107559	107560	107561	107561	My	0	” “
107565	107569	107561	107561	My	0	” said Elinor , “
107593	107594	107590	107591	Mr. Ferrars	144	” “
107627	107684	107603	107603	you	2750	” The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first . “
107697	107712	107603	107603	you	2750	” said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , “
107817	107818	107812	107812	Lucy	138	” “
107841	107842	107820	107821	Colonel Brandon	104	” “
107910	108498	107906	107906	Lucy	138	” Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . CHAPTER XLI . Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett ’s Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas . So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward _ would _ give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood ’s part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and secretly resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry . It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife ’s indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.—This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions . Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister ’s going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor ’s service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward ’s part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tête - à - tête with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out . He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in . They walked up stairs in to the drawing - room.—Nobody was there . “
108509	108513	108502	108502	her	93	” said he : “
108574	108584	108585	108585	I	0	” Elinor made what excuse she could for her . “
108594	108598	108585	108585	I	0	” he replied , “
108645	108646	108620	108620	he	217	” “
108661	108662	108651	108651	Brandon	104	” “
108686	108687	108663	108663	Really!—Well	219	” “
108694	108695	108663	108663	Really!—Well	219	” “
108876	108927	108941	108942	the Colonel	664	” Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority . “
108931	108938	108941	108942	the Colonel	664	astonishing!”—he cried , after hearing what she said—“what
108946	108947	108941	108942	the Colonel	664	” “
108961	108962	108958	108959	Mr. Ferrars	144	” “
109014	109055	109056	109057	Mrs. Ferrars	98	” Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished . “
109059	109075	109056	109057	Mrs. Ferrars	98	” added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , “
109118	109119	109111	109111	she	93	” “
109273	109274	109277	109277	Elinor	89	” “
109279	109283	109277	109277	Elinor	89	” said John , “
109358	109359	109360	109360	You	89	” “
109380	109381	109382	109382	You	89	” “
109400	109405	109387	109388	Mrs. Ferrars	98	” Elinor was silent . “
109409	109418	109421	109421	Robert	144	now_,”—said Mr. Dashwood , after a short pause , “
109428	109448	109421	109421	Robert	144	” Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother ’s tone , calmly replied , — “
109462	109463	109449	109450	The lady	370	” “
109469	109470	109466	109466	you	89	” “
109499	109500	109475	109475	I	0	” “
109550	109569	109538	109538	I	0	” Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.—His reflections ended thus . “
109580	109593	109538	109538	I	0	” kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper , “
109880	110275	109873	109874	Colonel Brandon	104	” Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;—and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars . After a few moments ’ chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister ’s being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother ’s love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother ’s integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart . They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject . Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on _ him _ . He laughed most immoderately . The idea of Edward ’s being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;—and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of hers , but by his own sensibility . “
110284	110308	109873	109874	Colonel Brandon	104	” said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment ; “
110629	110630	110622	110624	My poor mother	2354	” “
110638	110639	110635	110636	the lady	370	” “
110906	113371	110891	110891	He	147	” He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject . But though _ she _ never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself . She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;—an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful . CHAPTER XLII . One other short call in Harley Street , in which Elinor received her brother ’s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense , and on Colonel Brandon ’s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two , completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town;—and a faint invitation from Fanny , to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way , which of all things was the most unlikely to occur , with a more warm , though less public , assurance , from John to Elinor , of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford , was all that foretold any meeting in the country . It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford;—a place , in which , of all others , she would now least chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings , but even Lucy , when they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there . Very early in April , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes , to meet , by appointment , on the road . For the convenience of Charlotte and her child , they were to be more than two days on their journey , and Mr. Palmer , travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon , was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival . Marianne , few as had been her hours of comfort in London , and eager as she had long been to quit it , could not , when it came to the point , bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes , and that confidence , in Willoughby , which were now extinguished for ever , without great pain . Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained , busy in new engagements , and new schemes , in which _ she _ could have no share , without shedding many tears . Elinor ’s satisfaction , at the moment of removal , was more positive . She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on , she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment ’s regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy ’s friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne ’s peace of mind , and confirming her own . Their journey was safely performed . The second day brought them into the cherished , or the prohibited , county of Somerset , for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne ’s imagination ; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland . Cleveland was a spacious , modern - built house , situated on a sloping lawn . It had no park , but the pleasure - grounds were tolerably extensive ; and like every other place of the same degree of importance , it had its open shrubbery , and closer wood walk , a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation , led to the front , the lawn was dotted over with timber , the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir , the mountain - ash , and the acacia , and a thick screen of them altogether , interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars , shut out the offices . Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton , and not thirty from Combe Magna ; and before she had been five minutes within its walls , while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper , she quitted it again , stealing away through the winding shrubberies , now just beginning to be in beauty , to gain a distant eminence ; where , from its Grecian temple , her eye , wandering over a wide tract of country to the south - east , could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon , and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen . In such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles . She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house , on an excursion through its more immediate premises ; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away , in lounging round the kitchen garden , examining the bloom upon its walls , and listening to the gardener ’s lamentations upon blights , in dawdling through the green - house , where the loss of her favourite plants , unwarily exposed , and nipped by the lingering frost , raised the laughter of Charlotte,—and in visiting her poultry - yard , where , in the disappointed hopes of her dairy - maid , by hens forsaking their nests , or being stolen by a fox , or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood , she found fresh sources of merriment . The morning was fine and dry , and Marianne , in her plan of employment abroad , had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland . With great surprise therefore , did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner . She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even _ she _ could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking . Their party was small , and the hours passed quietly away . Mrs. Palmer had her child , and Mrs. Jennings her carpet - work ; they talked of the friends they had left behind , arranged Lady Middleton ’s engagements , and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther than Reading that night . Elinor , however little concerned in it , joined in their discourse ; and Marianne , who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library , however it might be avoided by the family in general , soon procured herself a book . Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer ’s side that constant and friendly good humour could do , to make them feel themselves welcome . The openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness ; her kindness , recommended by so pretty a face , was engaging ; her folly , though evident was not disgusting , because it was not conceited ; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh . The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner , affording a pleasant enlargement of the party , and a very welcome variety to their conversation , which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low . Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer , and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself , that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family . She found him , however , perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors , and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother ; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion , and only prevented from being so always , by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general , as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte . For the rest of his character and habits , they were marked , as far as Elinor could perceive , with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life . He was nice in his eating , uncertain in his hours ; fond of his child , though affecting to slight it ; and idled away the mornings at billiards , which ought to have been devoted to business . She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;—not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward ’s generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings . Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars , and the kind confidante of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.—His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs. Jennings ’s persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself . But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs. Jennings ’s suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two;—she watched his eyes , while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;—and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne ’s feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady ’s observation;—_she _ could discover in them the quick feelings , and needless alarm of a lover . Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had — assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings — given Marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself . Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined . Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night ’s rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies . CHAPTER XLIII . Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments . But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister ’s composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne ’s inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings ’s advice , of sending for the Palmers ’ apothecary . He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word “
113373	114663	114665	114665	mama	2826	” to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby ’s account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne ’s complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris ’s report , and confirming Charlotte ’s fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood . Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris ’s arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer ’s , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she _ then _ really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.—Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister ’s account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c. she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs. Jennings ’s entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence . Marianne was , of course , kept in ignorance of all these arrangements . She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival . It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer ; and as it gave her likewise no concern , she never mentioned her name . Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer ’s departure , and her situation continued , with little variation , the same . Mr. Harris , who attended her every day , still talked boldly of a speedy recovery , and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine ; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful . Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it , and Colonel Brandon , who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings ’s forebodings , was not in a state of mind to resist their influence . He tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more . On the morning of the third day however , the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away ; for when Mr. Harris arrived , he declared his patient materially better . Her pulse was much stronger , and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit . Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend ’s , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel . But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began . Towards the evening Marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before . Her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected the most beneficial effects . Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . Mrs. Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper ’s room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne . The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out , — “
114668	114669	114665	114665	mama	2826	” “
114673	114690	114665	114665	mama	2826	” cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , “
114719	114720	114711	114711	you	2364	” “
114730	114740	114722	114722	she	2826	” cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner . “
114753	117130	117131	117132	Miss Dashwood	84	” Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse . It was lower and quicker than ever ! and Marianne , still talking wildly of mama , her alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr. Harris , and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother . To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing - room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present . It was no time for hesitation . Her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him . Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of:—he listened to them in silent despondence;—but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood . Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome . She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris , and an order for post - horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother . The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon — or such a companion for her mother,—how gratefully was it felt!—a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her!—as far as the shock of such a summons _ could _ be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it . _ He _ , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return . Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind . The horses arrived , even before they were expected , and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity , and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear , hurried into the carriage . It was then about twelve o’clock , and she returned to her sister ’s apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night . It was a night of almost equal suffering to both . Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne ’s side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor ’s , before Mr. Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought . Marianne ’s ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational . She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris , or if _ he _ could not come , for some other advice , when the former — but not till after five o’clock — arrived . His opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to Elinor . He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them . With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister ’s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope . Her heart was really grieved . The rapid decay , the early death of a girl so young , so lovely as Marianne , must have struck a less interested person with concern . On Mrs. Jennings ’s compassion she had other claims . She had been for three months her companion , was still under her care , and she was known to have been greatly injured , and long unhappy . The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her;—and as for their mother , when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to _ her _ what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in _ her _ sufferings was very sincere . Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;—but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce . His medicines had failed;—the fever was unabated ; and Marianne only more quiet — not more herself — remained in a heavy stupor . Elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice . But he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood . She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister ’s bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne ’s disappointment had brought on . Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea , and it gave fresh misery to her reflections . About noon , however , she began — but with a caution — a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend — to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister ’s pulse;—she waited , watched , and examined it again and again;—and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes . Mrs. Jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;—and Elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope . But it was too late . Hope had already entered ; and feeling all its anxious flutter , she bent over her sister to watch — she hardly knew for what . Half an hour passed away , and the favourable symptom yet blessed her . Others even arose to confirm it . Her breath , her skin , her lips , all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment ; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational , though languid , gaze . Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees , and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o’clock;—when his assurances , his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation , gave her confidence , comfort , and tears of joy . Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety . Marianne restored to life , health , friends , and to her doting mother , was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort , and expand it in fervent gratitude;—but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy , no words , no smiles . All within Elinor ’s breast was satisfaction , silent and strong . She continued by the side of her sister , with little intermission the whole afternoon , calming every fear , satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits , supplying every succour , and watching almost every look and every breath . The possibility of a relapse would of course , in some moments , occur to remind her of what anxiety was — but when she saw , on her frequent and minute examination , that every symptom of recovery continued , and saw Marianne at six o’clock sink into a quiet , steady , and to all appearance comfortable , sleep , she silenced every doubt . The time was now drawing on , when Colonel Brandon might be expected back . At ten o’clock , she trusted , or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them . The Colonel , too!—perhaps scarcely less an object of pity!—Oh!—how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance ! At seven o’clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing - room to tea . Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears , and of dinner by their sudden reverse , from eating much;—and the present refreshment , therefore , with such feelings of content as she brought to it , was particularly welcome . Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother ’s arrival , and allow _ her _ to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant . Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep . The night was cold and stormy . The wind roared round the house , and the rain beat against the windows ; but Elinor , all happiness within , regarded it not . Marianne slept through every blast ; and the travellers — they had a rich reward in store , for every present inconvenience . The clock struck eight . Had it been ten , Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house ; and so strong was the persuasion that she _ did _ , in spite of the _ almost _ impossibility of their being already come , that she moved into the adjoining dressing - closet and opened a window shutter , to be satisfied of the truth . She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her . The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view . By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses ; and this , while it told the excess of her poor mother ’s alarm , gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity . Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm , as at that moment . The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door — of her doubt — her dread — perhaps her despair!—and of what _ she _ had to tell!—with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm . All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings ’s maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs . The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room,—she entered it,—and saw only Willoughby . CHAPTER XLIV . Elinor , starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him , obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room , and her hand was already on the lock , when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing , and saying , in a voice rather of command than supplication , “
117149	117150	117143	117143	I	0	” “
117155	117161	117153	117153	sir	2095	” she replied with firmness , “
117198	117199	117179	117180	The servants	538	” “
117205	117211	117201	117201	they	538	” he cried with vehemence , “
117244	117245	117242	117242	you	0	” “
117247	117250	117242	117242	you	0	me!”—in the utmost amazement—“well
117263	117264	117252	117252	sir,—be	2368	” “
117274	117373	117269	117269	I	0	” She hesitated ; she knew not what to do . The possibility of Colonel Brandon ’s arriving and finding her there , came across her . But she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged . After a moment ’s recollection , therefore , concluding that prudence required dispatch , and that her acquiescence would best promote it , she walked silently towards the table , and sat down . He took the opposite chair , and for half a minute not a word was said by either . “
117378	117381	117269	117269	I	0	sir,”—said Elinor , impatiently;—“I
117388	117406	117407	117408	Your sister	2815	” He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation , and seemed not to hear her . “
117410	117419	117407	117408	Your sister	2815	” said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards—“is
117443	117458	117428	117429	the servant	818	” Elinor would not speak . He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness . “
117477	117478	117481	117481	she	2815	” “
117484	117495	117481	117481	she	2815	” He rose up , and walked across the room . “
117512	117523	117481	117481	she	2815	” speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat,—“what
117561	117569	117571	117571	you	84	” a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks , “
117581	117628	117571	117571	you	84	” Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever . She began to think that he must be in liquor;—the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying , “
117672	117673	117674	117674	I	0	” “
117678	117693	117676	117676	you	84	” he replied , with an expressive smile , and a voice perfectly calm ; “
117719	117720	117676	117676	you	84	” “
117722	117739	117676	117676	you	84	Marlborough!”—cried Elinor , more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at . “
117771	117819	117820	117821	Mr. Willoughby	107	” The steadiness of his manner , and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke , convincing Elinor , that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland , he was not brought there by intoxication , she said , after a moment ’s recollection , “
117873	117874	117868	117868	you	107	” “
117878	117886	117868	117868	you	107	” said he , with serious energy , “
117966	117967	117960	117960	Ma	226	” “
117977	117978	117974	117974	your	107	” “
117983	118011	117974	117974	your	107	is,”—was his answer , with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance , and in spite of herself made her think him sincere . “
118037	118038	118040	118040	she	90	” “
118042	118052	118040	118040	she	90	” he cried , in the same eager tone . “
118088	118094	118083	118083	you	107	” Elinor bowed her assent . “
118100	118119	118083	118083	you	107	” said he , after a pause of expectation on her side , and thoughtfulness on his own , “
118338	118363	118370	118371	Mr. Willoughby	107	” Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , “
118414	118415	118416	118416	I	0	” “
118426	118430	118416	118416	I	0	” he replied , “
118728	118729	118730	118730	You	0	” “
118734	118742	118730	118730	You	0	” said Elinor , a little softened , “
118752	118753	118744	118744	yourself	0	” “
119048	119055	119056	119057	Mrs. Smith	120	place,”—here he hesitated and looked down . “
119098	119112	119116	119116	you	2815	” he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,—“your
119126	119127	119128	119128	I	0	” “
119131	119149	119128	119128	I	0	” returned Elinor , colouring likewise , and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him , “
119179	119180	119172	119172	I	0	” “
119183	119187	119172	119172	I	0	” cried Willoughby , “
119384	119385	119386	119386	Your	2394	” “
119485	119486	119477	119477	she	2395	” “
119501	119506	119493	119493	I	0	” he warmly replied ; “
119534	119535	119527	119527	her	2395	” “
119546	119547	119543	119544	Mrs. Smith	120	” “
119968	119969	119972	119972	you	0	” “
119978	119984	119972	119972	you	0	” said Elinor , reproachfully ; “
120000	120001	119972	119972	you	0	” “
120242	120256	120258	120258	you	0	” They were both silent for a few moments . Elinor first spoke . “
120267	120268	120258	120258	you	0	” “
120278	120284	120274	120274	I	0	” he replied , impatiently ; “
120485	120489	120492	120492	sir	2095	” He stopped . “
120494	120510	120492	120492	sir	2095	” said Elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , “
120516	120517	120492	120492	sir	2095	” “
120536	120537	120531	120531	she	2416	” “
120547	120548	120553	120553	hers	2416	” “
120684	120722	120677	120677	I	0	” Elinor ’s heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again;—yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . “
120749	120750	120751	120751	Marianne	90	” “
121048	121049	121045	121045	my	0	” “
121057	121058	121045	121045	my	0	” “
121625	121643	121605	121605	She	90	” A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded . Willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : “
121665	121666	121667	121667	We	2448	” “
121673	121674	121675	121677	Your poor mother	2449	” “
121683	121684	121675	121677	Your poor mother	2449	” “
121705	121706	121697	121697	you	107	” “
121930	121931	121932	121932	Your	0	” “
121943	121944	121932	121932	Your	0	” “
122261	122262	122263	122263	You	2466	” “
122274	122292	122268	122269	Mr. Willoughby	107	” said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; “
122384	122385	122374	122374	I	0	” “
122395	122403	122411	122411	She	2468	” said he with a heavy sigh ; “
122502	122503	122493	122493	I	0	” “
122566	122567	122569	122569	you	2466	” “
122686	122687	122688	122688	I	0	” “
122729	122730	122707	122707	you	2466	” “
123048	123307	123044	123044	you	2476	” Elinor made no answer . Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper . The world had made him extravagant and vain — Extravagance and vanity had made him cold - hearted and selfish . Vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed . Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil , had led him likewise to punishment . The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said — “
123321	123322	123316	123316	I	0	” “
123330	123331	123324	123324	you	0	” “
123356	123376	123378	123378	you	2486	” He held out his hand . She could not refuse to give him hers;—he pressed it with affection . “
123391	123458	123378	123378	you	2486	” said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go . Elinor assured him that she did;—that she forgave , pitied , wished him well — was even interested in his happiness — and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it . His answer was not very encouraging . “
123463	123467	123378	123378	you	2486	” said he , “
123557	123565	123547	123547	I	0	” Elinor stopped him with a reproof . “
123566	123567	123589	123589	you	0	Well,”—he replied—“once
123585	123586	123589	123589	you	0	” “
123592	123593	123589	123589	you	0	” “
123599	123600	123589	123589	you	0	” “
123619	123620	123606	123606	She	2815	” “
123684	124445	124447	124447	Willoughby	107	” And with these words , he almost ran out of the room . CHAPTER XLV . Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister . Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself — to his wishes than to his merits . She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less . When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . Elinor ’s heart was full . The past , the present , the future , Willoughby ’s visit , Marianne ’s safety , and her mother ’s expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby ’s leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.—Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment ’s horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it . Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne ’s being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but _ she _ , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief ; and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend ; and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon ’s hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . Elinor ’s delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep : but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood _ would _ sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , in compliance with her mother ’s entreaty , went to bed . But the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of spirits . Willoughby , “
124449	124848	124447	124447	Willoughby	107	” as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to _ his _ sufferings and _ his _ constancy far more than to his rival ’s , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby ’s death . The shock of Colonel Brandon ’s errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood ’s looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward . But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;—and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor . It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred . “
124879	124901	124872	124872	He	104	” Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . “
124967	125031	125032	125032	He	104	” Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;—but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . “
125153	125192	125193	125193	His	104	” Here , however , Elinor perceived,—not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother ’s active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose . “
125276	125277	125278	125279	Colonel Brandon	104	” “
125283	125287	125289	125291	an excellent man	3305	” said Elinor , “
125297	125298	125289	125291	an excellent man	3305	” “
125302	125307	125278	125279	Colonel Brandon	104	is,”—replied her mother seriously , “
125363	125364	125365	125365	His	104	” “
125370	125374	125365	125365	His	104	” answered Elinor , “
125497	125498	125488	125488	you	0	” “
125663	125664	125655	125655	His	104	” “
125684	125685	125675	125675	you	0	” “
125860	125881	125883	125883	his	104	” Elinor could _ not _ remember it ; but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , “
126003	126027	126000	126001	Colonel Brandon	104	” She paused.—Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . “
126041	126046	126031	126031	she	90	” added Mrs. Dashwood , “
126091	126108	126109	126109	His	2522	” Poor Elinor!—here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!—but her spirit was stubborn . “
126149	127349	126139	126139	I	0	” Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby . CHAPTER XLVI . Marianne ’s illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother ’s presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into Mrs. Palmer ’s dressing - room . When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her . His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor ’s conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs. Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel ’s behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . At the end of another day or two , Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours , Mrs. Dashwood , urged equally by her own and her daughter ’s wishes , began to talk of removing to Barton . On _ her _ measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs. Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ’ stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable . At his and Mrs. Jennings ’s united request in return , Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back , for the better accommodation of her sick child ; and the Colonel , at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings , whose active good - nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself , engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage , in the course of a few weeks . The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford . The Dashwoods were two days on the road , and Marianne bore her journey on both , without essential fatigue . Every thing that the most zealous affection , the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable , was the office of each watchful companion , and each found their reward in her bodily ease , and her calmness of spirits . To Elinor , the observation of the latter was particularly grateful . She , who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering , oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of , nor fortitude to conceal , now saw with a joy , which no other could equally share , an apparent composure of mind , which , in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection , must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness . As they approached Barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window . But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise . In the whole of her subsequent manner , she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion ; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting - room , than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness , as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.—She said little , but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness , and though a sigh sometimes escaped her , it never passed away without the atonement of a smile . After dinner she would try her piano - forte . She went to it ; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera , procured for her by Willoughby , containing some of their favourite duets , and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand - writing.—That would not do.—She shook her head , put the music aside , and after running over the keys for a minute , complained of feebleness in her fingers , and closed the instrument again ; declaring however with firmness as she did so , that she should in future practice much . The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms . On the contrary , with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest , she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit , anticipating the pleasure of Margaret ’s return , and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored , of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society , as the only happiness worth a wish . “
127363	127367	126139	126139	I	0	” said she , “
127589	127869	127582	127582	I	0	” Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self - control . Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity . Willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister ’s health were more secure , before she appointed it . But the resolution was made only to be broken . Marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out . But at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter ’s wishes and the mother ’s confidence ; and Marianne , leaning on Elinor ’s arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house . The sisters set out at a pace , slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required ; and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill , the important hill behind , when pausing with her eyes turned towards it , Marianne calmly said , — “
127873	127878	127582	127582	I	0	there,”—pointing with one hand , “
127893	127907	127891	127891	Willoughby	107	” Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added , “
127935	127941	127933	127933	Elinor	89	” hesitatingly it was said . “
127966	127975	127957	127957	I	0	” Elinor tenderly invited her to be open . “
127980	127984	127985	127985	I	0	” said Marianne , “
128096	128109	128092	128094	that unfortunate girl	2395	” She stopt . Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered , “
128125	128126	128118	128118	you	89	” “
128196	128197	128224	128224	I	0	” “
128201	128206	128208	128208	you	0	” asked her sister , “
128214	128215	128208	128208	you	0	” “
128236	128275	128226	128226	him	107	” Elinor said no more . She was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly , or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;—and they crept on for a few minutes in silence . “
128285	128294	128276	128276	I	0	” said Marianne at last with a sigh , “
128317	128318	128320	128320	you	0	” “
128327	128328	128320	128320	you	0	” “
128348	128349	128342	128342	I	0	” “
128357	128358	128342	128342	I	0	” “
128951	129002	129003	129003	You	2551	” Here ceased the rapid flow of her self - reproving spirit ; and Elinor , impatient to soothe , though too honest to flatter , gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved . Marianne pressed her hand and replied , — “
129203	129214	129221	129221	his	107	” She paused — and added in a low voice , “
129230	129496	129498	129498	mama	2826	” Elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact . She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard . Marianne said not a word.—She trembled , her eyes were fixed on the ground , and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them . A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one . She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister ’s , and tears covered her cheeks . Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged . As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , “
129500	129862	129498	129498	mama	2826	” withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs . Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction . CHAPTER XLVII . Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite . She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;—she was sorry for him;—she wished him happy . But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.—Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken — a character unblemished , to Marianne . Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means , nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza . Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon . Had Mrs. Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby ’s story from himself — had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater . But it was neither in Elinor ’s power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby ’s deserts;—she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray . In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;—but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting — her rising colour , as she spoke,—and her unsteady voice , plainly showed . “
129870	129874	129863	129863	I	0	” said she , “
129889	129930	129940	129940	Elinor	89	” Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not Elinor , who really wished to hear her sister ’s unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence . Marianne slowly continued , — “
129957	129977	129940	129940	Elinor	89	”—For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before—“I
130031	130032	130033	130033	I	0	” “
130041	130046	130037	130037	I	0	” cried her mother . “
130108	130115	130116	130116	I	0	” Marianne sighed , and repeated , “
130122	130123	130124	130124	You	0	” “
130129	130133	130124	130124	You	0	” said Elinor , “
130436	130447	130415	130415	your	0	” Marianne ’s lips quivered , and she repeated the word “
130450	130455	130456	130456	you	0	” in a tone that implied—“do
130462	130463	130456	130456	you	0	” “
130470	130474	130415	130415	your	0	” replied Elinor , “
130547	130548	130543	130543	his	319	” “
130563	130564	130560	130560	his	319	” “
130568	130572	130573	130573	he	319	” continued Elinor , “
130741	130742	130743	130743	I	0	” “
130751	130755	130743	130743	I	0	” said Marianne ; “
130769	130770	130773	130774	your mother	2781	” “
130781	130786	130788	130788	she	2781	” said Mrs. Dashwood ; “
130794	130839	130788	130788	she	2781	” Marianne would not let her proceed;—and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ’s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , “
130898	131127	131246	131246	I	0	” Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon ’s injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her . Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health . Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward . She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne ’s illness ; and in the first of John ’s , there had been this sentence:—“We
131155	131245	131246	131246	I	0	” which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters . She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures . Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication , — “
131259	131470	131248	131248	you	0	” Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics . Mrs. Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant ’s inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor ’s countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne ’s situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention . The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs. Dashwood ’s assistance , supported her into the other room . By that time , Marianne was rather better , and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it . “
131482	131483	131480	131480	Thomas	189	” “
131678	131679	131668	131668	they	628	” “
131691	131692	131682	131682	she	232	” “
131743	131744	131735	131735	I	0	” “
131754	131755	131746	131747	Mr. Ferrars	144	” “
131783	131806	131777	131778	a gentleman	985	” Elinor ’s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation . “
131816	131817	131809	131811	no one else	1104	” “
131826	131827	131809	131811	no one else	1104	” “
131836	131837	131829	131829	you	0	” “
131853	131854	131845	131846	Miss Lucy	138	” “
131862	131863	131857	131857	they	2599	” “
131891	131972	131883	131883	they	2599	” Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but Elinor knew better than to expect them . She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them . She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt ’s , near Plymouth . Thomas ’s intelligence seemed over . Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . “
131984	131985	131974	131974	you	2602	” “
132012	132013	132005	132005	I	0	” “
132020	132021	132015	132016	Mrs. Ferrars	98	” “
132053	132807	132048	132048	she	98	” Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more . Mrs. Dashwood ’s and Elinor ’s appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before . When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence . Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor ’s representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne . She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;—that Marianne ’s affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude . CHAPTER XLVIII . Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence . That he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first . But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self - provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay . They were married , married in town , and now hastening down to her uncle ’s . What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton , on seeing her mother ’s servant , on hearing Lucy ’s message ! They would soon , she supposed , be settled at Delaford.—Delaford,—that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest ; which she wished to be acquainted with , and yet desired to avoid . She saw them in an instant in their parsonage - house ; saw in Lucy , the active , contriving manager , uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality , and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;—pursuing her own interest in every thought , courting the favour of Colonel Brandon , of Mrs. Jennings , and of every wealthy friend . In Edward — she knew not what she saw , nor what she wished to see;—happy or unhappy,—nothing pleased her ; she turned away her head from every sketch of him . Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars,—but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings . Though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend . They were all thoughtless or indolent . “
132818	132836	132810	132810	you	2607	” was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on . “
132887	133018	133019	133019	He	2611	” This was gaining something , something to look forward to . Colonel Brandon _ must _ have some information to give . Scarcely had she so determined it , when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window . He stopt at their gate . It was a gentleman , it was Colonel Brandon himself . Now she could hear more ; and she trembled in expectation of it . But it was _ not _ Colonel Brandon ; neither his air , nor his height . Were it possible , she must say it must be Edward . She looked again . He had just dismounted : she could not be mistaken,—it _ was _ Edward . She moved away and sat down . “
133046	133480	133037	133037	I	0	” In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake . She saw her mother and Marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other . She would have given the world to be able to speak — and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness , no slight , would appear in their behaviour to him;—but she had no utterance , and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion . Not a syllable passed aloud . They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor . His footsteps were heard along the gravel path ; in a moment he was in the passage , and in another he was before them . His countenance , as he entered the room , was not too happy , even for Elinor . His complexion was white with agitation , and he looked as if fearful of his reception , and conscious that he merited no kind one . Mrs. Dashwood , however , conforming , as she trusted , to the wishes of that daughter , by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing , met him with a look of forced complacency , gave him her hand , and wished him joy . He coloured , and stammered out an unintelligible reply . Elinor ’s lips had moved with her mother ’s , and , when the moment of action was over , she wished that she had shaken hands with him too . But it was then too late , and with a countenance meaning to be open , she sat down again and talked of the weather . Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight , to conceal her distress ; and Margaret , understanding some part , but not the whole of the case , thought it incumbent on her to be dignified , and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could , and maintained a strict silence . When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season , a very awful pause took place . It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood , who felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well . In a hurried manner , he replied in the affirmative . Another pause . Elinor resolving to exert herself , though fearing the sound of her own voice , now said , “
133487	133488	133482	133483	Mrs. Ferrars	98	” “
133492	133502	133482	133483	Mrs. Ferrars	98	” he replied , with an air of surprise . “
133511	133512	133513	133513	I	0	” “
133516	133528	133513	133513	I	0	” said Elinor , taking up some work from the table , “
133538	133573	133532	133536	Mrs. _ Edward _ Ferrars	98	” She dared not look up;—but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him . He coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said , — “
133590	133591	133586	133588	Robert _ Ferrars	144	” “
133596	133690	133581	133581	you	0	” was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ; and though Elinor could not speak , even _ her _ eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder . He rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice , — “
133719	133757	133715	133717	Miss Lucy Steele	138	” His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor , who sat with her head leaning over her work , in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was . “
133760	133764	133715	133717	Miss Lucy Steele	138	” said he , “
133777	134355	133715	133717	Miss Lucy Steele	138	” Elinor could sit it no longer . She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease . Edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw — or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village — leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden;—a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures . CHAPTER XLIX . Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre - determined by all;—for after experiencing the blessings of _ one _ imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother ’s consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of _ that _ , than the immediate contraction of another . His errand at Barton , in fact , was a simple one . It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;—and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air . How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told . This only need be said;—that when they all sat down to table at four o’clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother ’s consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men . His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits . He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;—and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire . He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness;—and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four . “
134367	134371	133715	133717	Miss Lucy Steele	138	” said he , “
134745	135413	135420	135420	Robert	144	” The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such — so great — as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night . Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . Marianne could speak _ her _ happiness only by tears . Comparisons would occur — regrets would arise ; and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor — how are _ her _ feelings to be described ? From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,—saw him honourably released from his former engagement,—saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,—she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity ; and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;—for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor ’s company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;—for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . Between _ them _ no subject is finished , no communication is even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over . Lucy ’s marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;—and Elinor ’s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,—a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family — it was beyond her comprehension to make out . To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle . Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest . Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother ’s affairs might have done , if applied to in time . She repeated it to Edward . “
135422	135428	135420	135420	Robert	144	” was his immediate observation . “
135434	135439	135420	135420	Robert	144	” he presently added , “
135479	135617	135457	135457	Lucy	138	” How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual . Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;—and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . He put the letter into Elinor ’s hands . “
135621	135806	135618	135619	DEAR SIR	235	“ Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another ’s . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain , “
135818	135822	135618	135619	DEAR SIR	235	“ LUCY FERRARS . “
135858	135868	135869	135869	I	0	” Elinor read and returned it without any comment . “
135881	135883	135869	135869	I	0	” said Edward.—“For
135965	135966	135986	135987	your mother	2781	” “
135974	135980	135986	135987	your mother	2781	” said Elinor , after a pause,—“they
136077	136078	136079	136079	She	2781	” “
136111	136502	136503	136503	I	0	” In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy ’s letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking _ that _ fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he _ did _ , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions — they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself . Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother ’s anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him . “
136509	136513	136506	136506	my	0	” said he , “
136675	136676	136680	136680	she	2646	” “
136767	136834	136835	136835	Your	2653	” Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy ’s conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it . Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy . “
136842	136846	136835	136835	Your	2653	” said she ; “
136885	136908	136909	136909	I	0	” He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement . “
137048	137103	137125	137125	he	2658	” Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon ’s being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford—“Which
137108	137112	137125	137125	he	2658	” said he , “
137136	137894	137895	137895	I	0	” _ Now _ he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . But so little interest had he taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome . They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain — and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life . Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on _ that _ he rested for the residue of their income . But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars ’s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert ’s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny . About four days after Edward ’s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs. Dashwood ’s satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold . Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ’ first tête - à - tête before breakfast . A three weeks ’ residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne ’s looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother ’s language , to make it cheerful . Among such friends , however , and such flattery , he did revive . No rumour of Lucy ’s marriage had yet reached him:—he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering . Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor . It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other ’s acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment . The letters from town , which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor ’s body thrill with transport , now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth . Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford . “

138115	138305	138107	138108	Miss Marianne	90	” Mr. Dashwood ’s strains were more solemn . Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women — poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility — and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder . Robert ’s offence was unpardonable , but Lucy ’s was infinitely worse . Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence . The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy ’s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family . He thus continued : — “
138436	138473	138420	138420	she	98	” This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward . It determined him to attempt a reconciliation , though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister . “
138480	138484	138486	138486	they	2670	” repeated he ; “
138557	138558	138542	138542	I	0	” “
138567	138571	138559	138559	You	0	” said Elinor , “
138607	138614	138617	138617	she	2781	” He agreed that he might . “
138647	138724	138727	138727	they	2673	” He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour . “
138735	138746	138727	138727	they	2673	” said Marianne , in her new character of candour , “
138767	139645	139646	139646	I	0	” After a visit on Colonel Brandon ’s side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together . They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town . CHAPTER L. After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son . Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating . For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again . In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;—told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;—and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _ three ; _ but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit — and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward ’s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny . It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs. Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more . With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn . The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion - house ; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage , and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;—could chuse papers , project shrubberies , and invent a sweep . Mrs. Jennings ’s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world . They had in fact nothing to wish for , but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne , and rather better pasturage for their cows . They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends . Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour . “
