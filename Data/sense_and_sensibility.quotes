1094	1137	1138	1138	He	85	“ Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . ”
2172	2183	2185	2186	her husband	318	“ It was my father ’s last request to me , ”
2188	2198	2185	2186	her husband	318	“ that I should assist his widow and daughters . ”
2199	2258	2185	2186	her husband	318	“ He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . ”
2259	2381	2185	2186	her husband	318	“ He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time . The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home . ”
2382	2406	2407	2407	she	373	“ Well , then , let something be done for them ; but that something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider , ”
2410	2452	2407	2407	she	373	“ that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy — ”
2453	2460	2462	2463	her husband	318	“ Why , to be sure , ”
2468	2511	2407	2407	she	373	“ that would make great difference . The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . ”
2512	2519	2185	2186	her husband	318	“ To be sure it would . ”
2520	2551	2407	2407	she	373	“ Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! ”
2552	2593	2407	2407	she	373	“ Oh ! beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if really his sisters ! And as it is — only half blood!—But you have such a generous spirit ! ”
2594	2605	2606	2606	he	318	“ I would not wish to do any thing mean , ”
2609	2650	2606	2606	he	318	“ One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . ”
2651	2661	2663	2664	the lady	375	“ There is no knowing what they may expect , ”
2666	2688	2663	2664	the lady	375	“ but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . ”
2689	2741	2407	2407	she	373	“ Certainly — and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother ’s death — a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . ”
2742	2808	2606	2606	he	318	“ To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . ”
2809	2881	2663	2664	the lady	375	“ That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them — something of the annuity kind I mean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . ”
2898	2903	2905	2905	she	279	“ To be sure , ”
2907	2938	2905	2905	she	279	“ it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . ”
2939	2957	2606	2606	he	318	“ Fifteen years ! my dear Fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . ”
2958	3201	2606	2606	he	318	“ Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father ’s will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother ’s disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . ”
3202	3210	3212	3213	Mr. Dashwood	83	“ It is certainly an unpleasant thing , ”
3215	3275	3212	3213	Mr. Dashwood	83	“ to have those kind of yearly drains on one ’s income . One ’s fortune , as your mother justly says , is not one ’s own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one ’s independence . ”
3276	3361	2606	2606	he	318	“ Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . ”
3362	3480	2606	2606	he	318	“ I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . ”
3481	3795	3212	3213	Mr. Dashwood	83	“ To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I ’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that?—They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year ! I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give you something . ”
3796	3801	3803	3804	Mr. Dashwood	83	“ Upon my word , ”
3806	3891	3803	3804	Mr. Dashwood	83	“ I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . ”
3892	3895	3897	3899	Mrs. John Dashwood	86	“ Certainly , ”
3901	3964	3897	3899	Mrs. John Dashwood	86	“ But , however , one thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . ”
3965	3997	3803	3804	Mr. Dashwood	83	“ That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . ”
3998	4097	3803	3804	Mr. Dashwood	83	“ Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place they can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of them . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to them . ”
5101	5106	5108	5108	she	86	“ It is enough , ”
5110	5131	5108	5108	she	86	“ to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . ”
5132	5140	5142	5142	Elinor	87	“ I think you will like him , ”
5144	5152	5142	5142	Elinor	87	“ when you know more of him . ”
5153	5157	5159	5160	her mother	332	“ Like him ! ”
5165	5176	5159	5160	her mother	332	“ I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . ”
5177	5183	5142	5142	Elinor	87	“ You may esteem him . ”
5184	5199	5159	5160	her mother	332	“ I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . ”
5326	5336	5338	5338	she	86	“ In a few months , my dear Marianne , ”
5340	5363	5338	5338	she	86	“ Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but she will be happy . ”
5364	5376	5295	5295	she	86	“ Oh ! Mama , how shall we do without her ? ”
5377	5448	5338	5338	she	86	“ My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward ’s heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister ’s choice ? ”
5449	5452	5454	5454	Marianne	88	“ Perhaps , ”
5456	5746	5454	5454	Marianne	88	“ I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet — he is not the kind of young man — there is something wanting — his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mama , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor ’s drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward ’s manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference ! ”
5747	5775	5338	5338	she	86	“ He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you would give him Cowper . ”
5776	5894	5454	5454	Marianne	88	“ Nay , Mama , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke my heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward ’s virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . ”
5895	5947	5338	5338	she	86	“ Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from hers ! ”
5951	5960	5962	5962	Marianne	88	“ What a pity it is , Elinor , ”
5964	5974	5962	5962	Marianne	88	“ that Edward should have no taste for drawing . ”
5975	5981	5983	5983	Elinor	87	“ No taste for drawing ! ”
5985	6099	5983	5983	Elinor	87	“ why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . ”
6177	6183	6185	6185	Elinor	87	“ I hope , Marianne , ”
6187	6238	6185	6185	Elinor	87	“ you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if that were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . ”
6276	6353	6273	6273	she	88	“ Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . ”
6354	6359	6361	6361	Elinor	87	“ I am sure , ”
6367	6394	6361	6361	Elinor	87	“ that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . ”
6406	6414	6416	6416	Elinor	87	“ Of his sense and his goodness , ”
6418	6681	6416	6416	Elinor	87	“ no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? ”
6682	6728	6729	6729	Elinor	87	“ I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . ”
6838	6846	6848	6848	she	87	“ I do not attempt to deny , ”
6850	6869	6848	6848	she	87	“ that I think very highly of him — that I greatly esteem , that I like him . ”
6877	6916	6870	6870	Marianne	88	“ Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . ”
6923	6927	6929	6929	she	87	“ Excuse me , ”
6931	7174	6929	6929	she	87	“ and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion — the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little — scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny ’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . ”
7194	7204	7206	7206	she	88	“ And you really are not engaged to him ! ”
7208	7284	7206	7206	she	88	“ Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! ”
8343	8366	8367	8367	She	86	“ Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? ”
8381	8388	8389	8389	she	86	“ It is but a cottage , ”
8392	8440	8389	8389	she	86	“ but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . ”
9230	9236	9238	9238	Marianne	88	“ Dear , dear Norland ! ”
9257	9366	9241	9241	she	88	“ when shall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you , ye well - known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!—No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoy you ? ”
9880	9891	9893	9893	she	86	“ As for the house itself , to be sure , ”
9895	10090	9893	9893	she	86	“ it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . ”
12757	12851	12743	12744	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ But at least , Mama , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings , but he is old enough to be my father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? ”
12852	12855	12857	12857	Elinor	87	“ Infirmity ! ”
12859	12901	12857	12857	Elinor	87	“ do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! ”
12902	12924	12743	12744	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? ”
12925	12930	12932	12933	her mother	332	“ My dearest child , ”
12937	12972	12932	12933	her mother	332	“ at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . ”
12973	13027	12743	12744	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Mama , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . ”
13028	13031	13033	13033	Elinor	87	“ Perhaps , ”
13035	13091	13033	13033	Elinor	87	“ thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon ’s being thirty - five any objection to his marrying her . ”
13092	13100	13102	13102	Marianne	88	“ A woman of seven and twenty , ”
13109	13230	13102	13102	Marianne	88	“ can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . ”
13231	13240	13242	13242	Elinor	87	“ It would be impossible , I know , ”
13244	13325	13242	13242	Elinor	87	“ to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . ”
13326	13334	13336	13336	Marianne	88	“ But he talked of flannel waistcoats , ”
13338	13369	13336	13336	Marianne	88	“ and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . ”
13370	13416	13242	13242	Elinor	87	“ Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? ”
13428	13431	13433	13433	Marianne	88	“ Mama , ”
13435	13496	13433	13433	Marianne	88	“ I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ? ”
13497	13508	13510	13511	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ Had you any idea of his coming so soon ? ”
13513	13569	13510	13511	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ I had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ? ”
13570	13585	13336	13336	Marianne	88	“ I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . ”
13586	13638	13336	13336	Marianne	88	“ I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . ”
13639	13789	13510	13511	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! In Edward ’s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? ”
14305	14314	14316	14316	Marianne	88	“ Is there a felicity in the world , ”
14318	14332	14316	14316	Marianne	88	“ superior to this?—Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . ”
15138	15141	15143	15144	Sir John	98	“ Willoughby ! ”
15146	15175	15143	15144	Sir John	98	“ what , is he in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . ”
15176	15182	15184	15185	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ You know him then , ”
15187	15206	15184	15185	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year . ”
15207	15218	15143	15144	Sir John	98	“ And what sort of a young man is he ? ”
15219	15249	15143	15144	Sir John	98	“ As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . ”
15250	15261	15263	15263	Marianne	88	“ And is that all you can say for him ? ”
15267	15288	15263	15263	Marianne	88	“ But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? ”
15295	15300	15302	15302	he	98	“ Upon my soul , ”
15304	15349	15302	15302	he	98	“ I do not know much about him as to all that . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? ”
15379	15385	15387	15387	Elinor	87	“ But who is he ? ”
15389	15403	15387	15387	Elinor	87	“ Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ? ”
15464	15547	15416	15416	he	98	“ Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . ”
15548	15554	15556	15557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ I do not believe , ”
15565	15644	15556	15557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . ”
15645	15662	15664	15665	Sir John	98	“ He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , ”
15667	15693	15664	15665	Sir John	98	“ I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o’clock till four , without once sitting down . ”
15694	15699	15701	15701	Marianne	88	“ Did he indeed ? ”
15706	15714	15701	15701	Marianne	88	“ and with elegance , with spirit ? ”
15715	15730	15664	15665	Sir John	98	“ Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . ”
15731	15770	15701	15701	Marianne	88	“ That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . ”
15771	15783	15785	15786	Sir John	98	“ Aye , aye , I see how it will be , ”
15788	15813	15785	15786	Sir John	98	“ I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . ”
15814	15823	15825	15825	Marianne	88	“ That is an expression , Sir John , ”
15829	15899	15825	15825	Marianne	88	“ which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ‘ setting one ’s cap at a man , ’ or ‘ making a conquest , ’ are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . ”
15923	15978	15910	15910	he	98	“ Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . ”
16538	16543	16545	16545	Elinor	87	“ Well , Marianne , ”
16555	16675	16545	16545	Elinor	87	“ for one morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby ’s opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper . But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . ”
16676	16679	16681	16681	Marianne	88	“ Elinor , ”
16683	16781	16681	16681	Marianne	88	“ is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful — had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . ”
16782	16786	16788	16789	her mother	332	“ My love , ”
16791	16830	16788	16789	her mother	332	“ you must not be offended with Elinor — she was only in jest . I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . ”
17613	17622	17624	17624	Willoughby	105	“ Brandon is just the kind of man , ”
17636	17663	17624	17624	Willoughby	105	“ whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . ”
17664	17674	17676	17676	Marianne	88	“ That is exactly what I think of him , ”
17678	17687	17689	17689	Elinor	87	“ Do not boast of it , however , ”
17691	17727	17689	17689	Elinor	87	“ for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . ”
17728	17736	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ That he is patronised by you , ”
17740	17793	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? ”
17794	17845	17624	17624	Willoughby	105	“ But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . ”
17846	17858	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ In defence of your protégé you can even be saucy . ”
17859	17949	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ My protégé , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . ”
17950	17956	17958	17958	Marianne	88	“ That is to say , ”
17961	17983	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . ”
17984	18017	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ He would have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . ”
18018	18021	18023	18023	Willoughby	105	“ Perhaps , ”
18025	18043	18023	18023	Willoughby	105	“ his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . ”
18044	18068	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ I may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour . But why should you dislike him ? ”
18069	18128	17738	17738	Willoughby	105	“ I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body ’s good word , and nobody ’s notice ; who has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . ”
18129	18134	18136	18136	Marianne	88	“ Add to which , ”
18138	18168	18136	18136	Marianne	88	“ that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . ”
18169	18181	18183	18183	Elinor	87	“ You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , ”
18185	18246	18183	18183	Elinor	87	“ and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart . ”
18247	18251	18253	18253	Willoughby	105	“ Miss Dashwood , ”
18255	18407	18253	18253	Willoughby	105	“ you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . ”
19467	19481	19459	19459	he	103	“ Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . ”
19482	19485	19487	19487	Elinor	87	“ No , ”
19489	19496	19459	19459	he	103	“ her opinions are all romantic . ”
19497	19512	19459	19459	he	103	“ Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . ”
19513	19585	19459	19459	he	103	“ I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . ”
19586	19594	19595	19595	he	103	“ This will probably be the case , ”
19598	19631	19595	19595	he	103	“ and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . ”
19632	19641	19643	19643	Elinor	87	“ I can not agree with you there , ”
19645	19704	19709	19709	he	103	“ There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne ’s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . ”
19717	19777	19709	19709	he	103	“ Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? ”
19778	19814	19709	19709	he	103	“ Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment ’s being pardonable . ”
19815	19818	19820	19820	he	103	“ This , ”
19822	19920	19820	19820	he	103	“ can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments — No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change — from a series of unfortunate circumstances — ”
20214	20227	20228	20228	she	87	“ He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it , ”
20231	20269	20228	20228	she	87	“ and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me . Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . ”
20389	20396	20398	20398	she	87	“ You are mistaken , Elinor , ”
20401	20528	20398	20398	she	87	“ in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;—it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . ”
20733	20783	20726	20726	he	105	voice,—“But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . ”
20960	20965	20966	20966	she	106	“ Oh , Elinor ! ”
20969	20994	20966	20966	she	106	“ I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . ”
20995	21001	21003	21003	Elinor	87	“ You have said so , ”
21005	21059	21003	21003	Elinor	87	“ almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . ”
21060	21089	20966	20966	she	106	“ But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . ”
21090	21109	20966	20966	she	106	“ Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of his . ”
21110	21225	20966	20966	she	106	“ But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne ’s . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . ”
21330	21341	21319	21319	Margaret	89	“ I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? ”
21421	21438	21398	21398	she	88	“ Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . ”
21439	21448	21450	21450	Margaret	89	“ I never had any conjectures about it , ”
21452	21463	21450	21450	Margaret	89	“ it was you who told me of it yourself . ”
21482	21497	21499	21500	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , ”
21502	21510	21499	21500	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ What is the gentleman ’s name ? ”
21511	21536	21450	21450	Margaret	89	“ I must not tell , ma’am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . ”
21537	21570	21499	21500	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . ”
21571	21587	21499	21500	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ No , that he is not . He is of no profession at all . ”
21588	21591	21593	21593	Marianne	88	“ Margaret , ”
21598	21621	21593	21593	Marianne	88	“ you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . ”
21622	21652	21499	21500	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. ”
21668	21675	21677	21677	she	87	“ that it rained very hard , ”
22179	22187	22189	22190	Sir John	98	“ What is the matter with Brandon ? ”
22196	22206	22208	22209	Lady Middleton	99	“ I hope he has had no bad news , ”
22211	22229	22208	22209	Lady Middleton	99	“ It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . ”
22237	22247	22249	22250	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; ”
22260	22271	22249	22250	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ None at all , ma’am , I thank you . ”
22272	22291	22208	22209	Lady Middleton	99	“ Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . ”
22292	22310	22249	22250	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ No , ma’am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . ”
22311	22352	22249	22250	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this wo n’t do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . ”
22353	22358	22360	22361	Lady Middleton	99	“ My dear madam , ”
22363	22370	22360	22361	Lady Middleton	99	“ recollect what you are saying . ”
22371	22385	22387	22388	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? ”
22398	22407	22387	22388	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ No , indeed , it is not . ”
22408	22429	22360	22361	Lady Middleton	99	“ Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well . ”
22430	22438	22440	22440	he	873	“ Whom do you mean , ma’am ? ”
22446	22455	22440	22440	he	873	“ Oh ! you know who I mean . ”
22456	22464	22466	22466	he	873	“ I am particularly sorry , ma’am , ”
22472	22494	22466	22466	he	873	“ that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . ”
22495	22499	22501	22502	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ In town ! ”
22504	22519	22501	22502	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? ”
22520	22527	22528	22528	he	873	“ My own loss is great , ”
22531	22563	22528	22528	he	873	“ in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell . ”
22573	22587	22589	22589	Marianne	88	“ But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , ”
22593	22600	22589	22589	Marianne	88	“ will it not be sufficient ? ”
22606	22611	22613	22614	Sir John.—“It	115	“ We must go , ”
22614	22642	22528	22528	he	873	John.—“It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . ”
22643	22668	22684	22685	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! ”
22669	22682	22684	22685	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ If you would but let us know what your business is , ”
22687	22700	22684	22685	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ we might see whether it could be put off or not . ”
22701	22710	22712	22712	Willoughby	105	“ You would not be six hours later , ”
22714	22726	22712	22712	Willoughby	105	“ if you were to defer your journey till our return . ”
22727	22737	22741	22741	Willoughby	105	“ I can not afford to lose one hour . ”
22751	22804	22741	22741	Willoughby	105	“ There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them . He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . ”
22805	22813	22815	22815	Marianne	88	“ I have no doubt of it , ”
22817	22835	22837	22838	Sir John	98	“ There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , ”
22840	22904	22837	22838	Sir John	98	“ when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . ”
22931	22943	22909	22909	his	103	“ Well , then , when will you come back again ? ”
22944	22954	22956	22957	her ladyship	571	“ I hope we shall see you at Barton , ”
22959	22982	22956	22957	her ladyship	571	“ as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return . ”
22983	23016	22909	22909	his	103	“ You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . ”
23017	23027	23029	23030	Sir John	98	“ Oh ! he must and shall come back , ”
23032	23051	23029	23030	Sir John	98	“ If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . ”
23052	23061	23063	23064	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Ay , so do , Sir John , ”
23066	23079	23063	23064	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . ”
23080	23103	23104	23105	Colonel Brandon	103	“ I do not want to pry into other men ’s concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . ”
23111	23124	23126	23127	Sir John	98	“ You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? ”
23129	23142	23126	23127	Sir John	98	“ No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post . ”
23143	23168	23063	23064	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey . But you had better change your mind . ”
23169	23180	23181	23181	He	103	“ I assure you it is not in my power . ”
23190	23210	23181	23181	He	103	“ Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? ”
23211	23220	23063	23064	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I am afraid , none at all . ”
23221	23239	23181	23181	He	103	“ Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . ”
23250	23254	23256	23257	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Come Colonel , ”
23259	23274	23256	23257	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ before you go , do let us know what you are going about . ”
23324	23335	23337	23338	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I can guess what his business is , however , ”
23341	23347	23337	23338	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Can you , ma’am ? ”
23353	23366	23337	23338	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . ”
23367	23374	23376	23376	Marianne	88	“ And who is Miss Williams ? ”
23378	23433	23376	23376	Marianne	88	“ What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel ’s , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . ”
23447	23454	23442	23442	she	88	“ She is his natural daughter . ”
23455	23458	23437	23437	her	88	“ Indeed ! ”
23459	23485	23437	23437	her	88	“ Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . ”
23758	23779	23780	23780	Marianne	88	“ I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning . ”
23788	23793	23780	23780	Marianne	88	“ Where , pray ? ”
23794	23800	23802	23802	Willoughby	105	“ Did not you know , ”
23804	23814	23802	23802	Willoughby	105	“ that we had been out in my curricle ? ”
23815	23894	23895	23895	Marianne	88	“ Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out where you had been to . I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . ”
24058	24094	24048	24048	Marianne	88	“ Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? ”
24095	24120	24035	24035	she	87	“ Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . ”
24121	24167	24048	24048	Marianne	88	“ Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . ”
24168	24173	24175	24175	Elinor	87	“ I am afraid , ”
24177	24191	24175	24175	Elinor	87	“ that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . ”
24192	24254	24035	24035	she	87	“ On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . ”
24255	24288	24048	24048	Marianne	88	“ But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? ”
24289	24365	24175	24175	Elinor	87	“ If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith ’s grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby ’s , and — ”
24366	24390	24391	24391	She	900	“ If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . ”
24431	24608	24417	24417	she	900	“ Perhaps , Elinor , it was rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.—There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,—but if it were newly fitted up — a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England . ”
24750	24763	24765	24765	she	102	“ Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure , ”
24767	25007	24765	24765	she	102	“ I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . ”
25510	25513	25514	25514	he	105	“ What ! ”
25515	25552	25493	25493	he	105	exclaimed—“Improve this dear cottage ! No . That I will never consent to . Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded . ”
25553	25559	25561	25562	Miss Dashwood	106	“ Do not be alarmed , ”
25564	25585	25561	25562	Miss Dashwood	106	“ nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it . ”
25586	25594	25595	25595	he	105	“ I am heartily glad of it , ”
25598	25614	25595	25595	he	105	“ May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better . ”
25615	25712	25493	25493	he	105	“ Thank you , Willoughby . But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world . Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ? ”
25713	25717	25719	25719	he	925	“ I am , ”
25721	25772	25719	25719	he	925	“ To me it is faultless . Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . ”
25773	25787	25789	25789	Elinor	87	“ With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose , ”
25791	25794	25796	25796	he	925	“ Yes , ”
25803	25853	25796	25796	he	925	“ with all and every thing belonging to it;—in no one convenience or inconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton . ”
25854	25859	25861	25861	Elinor	87	“ I flatter myself , ”
25863	25892	25861	25861	Elinor	87	“ that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . ”
25893	25899	25901	25901	Willoughby	105	“ There certainly are circumstances , ”
25903	25931	25901	25901	Willoughby	105	“ which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share . ”
25959	25966	25968	25968	he	105	“ How often did I wish , ”
25970	26083	25968	25968	he	105	“ when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for . Must it not have been so , Marianne ? ”
26101	26198	26098	26098	he	105	“ And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs. Dashwood ? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford . ”
26214	26221	26222	26222	he	105	“ You are a good woman , ”
26226	26295	26222	26222	he	105	“ Your promise makes me easy . Extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me . ”
26320	26329	26331	26332	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ? ”
26340	26366	26331	26332	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton . ”
26605	26613	26615	26616	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ Is anything the matter with her ? ”
26619	26623	26618	26618	she	86	entered—“is she ill ? ”
26624	26629	26630	26630	he	105	“ I hope not , ”
26646	26669	26630	26630	he	105	“ It is I who may rather expect to be ill — for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! ”
26670	26673	26618	26618	she	86	“ Disappointment ? ”
26674	26742	26618	26618	she	86	“ Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . ”
26743	26752	26630	26630	he	105	“ To London!—and are you going this morning ? ”
26753	26758	26618	26618	she	86	“ Almost this moment . ”
26759	26783	26784	26784	He	939	“ This is very unfortunate . But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;—and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . ”
26790	26819	26784	26784	He	939	“ You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth . ”
26820	26857	26858	26858	His	939	“ And is Mrs. Smith your only friend ? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? ”
26874	26880	26870	26870	he	939	“ You are too good . ”
26908	26975	26903	26904	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . ”
26976	26982	26984	26984	Willoughby	105	“ My engagements at present , ”
26988	27003	27004	27004	He	105	“ are of such a nature — that — I dare not flatter myself — ”
27034	27066	27025	27025	Willoughby	105	“ It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . ”
27339	27352	27354	27354	she	332	“ Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , ”
27363	27374	27354	27354	she	332	“ and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? ”
27375	27485	27354	27354	she	332	“ It is all very strange . So suddenly to be gone ! It seems but the work of a moment . And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? And now , after only ten minutes notice — Gone too without intending to return!—Something more than what he owned to us must have happened . He did not speak , he did not behave like himself . You must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be ? Can they have quarrelled ? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ? ”
27486	27543	27354	27354	she	332	“ It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see that . He had not the power of accepting it . I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . ”
27544	27550	27354	27354	she	332	“ Can you , indeed ! ”
27551	27770	27354	27354	she	332	“ Yes . I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;—but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can — it will not satisfy you , I know ; but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it . I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;—and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she does disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may not have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? ”
27771	27781	27354	27354	she	332	“ Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . ”
27782	27953	27354	27354	she	332	“ Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! You had rather take evil upon credit than good . You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter . You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ? And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? ”
27954	28072	27354	27354	she	332	“ I can hardly tell myself . But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him . There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has . But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once . Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . ”
28073	28116	27354	27354	she	332	“ Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?—I am happy — and he is acquitted . ”
28117	28174	27354	27354	she	332	“ Not entirely . It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they are engaged ) from Mrs. Smith — and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . ”
28175	28211	27354	27354	she	332	“ Concealing it from us ! my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ? This is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness . ”
28212	28221	28223	28223	Elinor	87	“ I want no proof of their affection , ”
28225	28233	28223	28223	Elinor	87	“ but of their engagement I do . ”
28234	28242	27354	27354	she	332	“ I am perfectly satisfied of both . ”
28243	28262	27354	27354	she	332	“ Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . ”
28263	28415	27354	27354	she	332	“ I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? How could such a thought occur to you ? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister ’s love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection;—that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ? ”
28416	28420	28422	28422	Elinor	87	“ I confess , ”
28424	28459	28422	28422	Elinor	87	“ that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement ; but that one is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . ”
28460	28524	27354	27354	she	332	“ How strange this is ! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ? ”
28525	28544	27354	27354	she	332	“ No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . ”
28545	28575	28422	28422	Elinor	87	“ But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . ”
28576	28635	27354	27354	she	332	“ You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . ”
28636	28745	27354	27354	she	332	“ A mighty concession indeed ! If you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . Ungracious girl ! But I require no such proof . Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . You can not doubt your sister ’s wishes . It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ? can he be deceitful ? ”
28746	28755	28757	28757	Elinor	87	“ I hope not , I believe not , ”
28759	28997	28757	28757	Elinor	87	“ I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;—he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , he might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;—but I will not raise objections against any one ’s conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . ”
28998	29119	29120	29120	They	951	“ You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though we have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . ”
29745	29750	29752	29752	she	86	“ Remember , Elinor , ”
29754	29806	29752	29752	she	86	“ how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John ’s hands . ”
29874	29884	29886	29886	she	87	“ Why do you not ask Marianne at once , ”
29888	29947	29886	29886	she	87	“ whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . ”
29948	30086	30087	30087	Elinor	87	“ I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne ’s heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . ”
30184	30229	30171	30172	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before that happens . ”
30230	30233	30235	30235	Marianne	88	“ Months ! ”
30241	30248	30235	30235	Marianne	88	“ No — nor many weeks . ”
30562	30572	30558	30558	Marianne	88	“ It is he ; it is indeed;—I know it is!”—and
30584	30615	30580	30580	Elinor	87	“ Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . ”
30616	30623	30625	30625	Marianne	88	“ He has , he has , ”
30627	30651	30625	30625	Marianne	88	“ I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse . I knew how soon he would come . ”
31062	31066	31067	31067	she	88	“ A fortnight ! ”
31106	31114	31116	31116	Elinor	87	“ Have you been lately in Sussex ? ”
31118	31128	31116	31116	Elinor	87	“ I was at Norland about a month ago . ”
31129	31139	31141	31141	Marianne	88	“ And how does dear , dear Norland look ? ”
31143	31149	31151	31151	Elinor	87	“ Dear , dear Norland , ”
31153	31178	31151	31151	Elinor	87	“ probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . ”
31179	31182	31184	31184	Marianne	88	“ Oh , ”
31186	31263	31184	31184	Marianne	88	“ with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . ”
31264	31271	31273	31273	Elinor	87	“ It is not every one , ”
31275	31284	31273	31273	Elinor	87	“ who has your passion for dead leaves . ”
31285	31304	31184	31184	Marianne	88	“ No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But sometimes they are . ”—As
31322	31327	31329	31329	she	88	“ Now , Edward , ”
31338	31408	31329	31329	she	88	“ here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ? To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . ”
31409	31416	31417	31417	he	1005	“ It is a beautiful country , ”
31420	31430	31417	31417	he	1005	“ but these bottoms must be dirty in winter . ”
31431	31445	31329	31329	she	88	“ How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? ”
31446	31449	31451	31451	he	1005	“ Because , ”
31455	31472	31451	31451	he	1005	“ among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane . ”
31473	31477	31481	31481	herself	88	“ How strange ! ”
31487	31501	31481	31481	herself	88	“ Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ? ”
31502	31508	31510	31510	Marianne	88	“ No , not all , ”
31512	31521	31510	31510	Marianne	88	“ we could not be more unfortunately situated . ”
31522	31525	31527	31528	her sister	339	“ Marianne , ”
31530	31580	31527	31528	her sister	339	“ how can you say so ? How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr. Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ? ”
31581	31584	31586	31586	Marianne	88	“ No , ”
31593	31600	31586	31586	Marianne	88	“ nor how many painful moments . ”
31910	31924	31926	31926	she	86	“ What are Mrs. Ferrars ’s views for you at present , Edward ? ”
31940	31954	31926	31926	she	86	“ are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? ”
31955	31978	32142	32142	Marianne	88	“ No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! ”
31979	32027	31926	31926	she	86	“ But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . ”
32028	32066	31926	31926	she	86	“ I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven ! I can not be forced into genius and eloquence . ”
32067	32083	32142	32142	Marianne	88	“ You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate . ”
32084	32133	31926	31926	she	86	“ As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so . ”
32134	32140	32142	32142	Marianne	88	“ Strange that it would ! ”
32144	32155	32142	32142	Marianne	88	“ What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? ”
32156	32162	32164	32164	Elinor	87	“ Grandeur has but little , ”
32166	32176	32164	32164	Elinor	87	“ but wealth has much to do with it . ”
32177	32183	32185	32185	Marianne	88	“ Elinor , for shame ! ”
32187	32221	32185	32185	Marianne	88	“ money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . ”
32222	32225	32227	32227	Elinor	87	“ Perhaps , ”
32231	32294	32227	32227	Elinor	87	“ we may come to the same point . Your competence and my wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? ”
32295	32310	32311	32311	Elinor	87	“ About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than that . ”
32314	32332	32311	32311	Elinor	87	“ two thousand a year ! one is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end . ”
32333	32347	32349	32349	Marianne	88	“ And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , ”
32351	32396	32349	32349	Marianne	88	“ A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . ”
32415	32418	32397	32397	Elinor	87	“ Hunters ! ”
32420	32433	32434	32434	Marianne	88	Edward—“but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . ”
32440	32446	32437	32437	she	88	“ But most people do . ”
32447	32451	32453	32453	Margaret	89	“ I wish , ”
32461	32473	32453	32453	Margaret	89	“ that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! ”
32474	32480	32482	32482	Marianne	88	“ Oh that they would ! ”
32502	32514	32516	32516	Elinor	87	“ We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , ”
32518	32527	32516	32516	Elinor	87	“ in spite of the insufficiency of wealth . ”
32528	32532	32534	32534	Margaret	89	“ Oh dear ! ”
32536	32552	32534	32534	Margaret	89	“ how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! ”
32565	32578	32557	32557	she	88	“ I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , ”
32583	32596	32580	32581	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ if my children were all to be rich without my help . ”
32597	32607	32609	32609	Elinor	87	“ You must begin your improvements on this house , ”
32611	32619	32609	32609	Elinor	87	“ and your difficulties will soon vanish . ”
32620	32632	32634	32634	Edward	97	“ What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , ”
32636	32786	32634	32634	Edward	97	“ in such an event ! What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you — and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books!—Thomson , Cowper , Scott — she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes . ”
32787	32860	32609	32609	Elinor	87	“ I love to be reminded of the past , Edward — whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it — and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent — some of it , at least — my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . ”
32861	32881	32609	32609	Elinor	87	“ And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs . ”
32882	32897	32634	32634	Edward	97	“ No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . ”
32898	32949	32609	32609	Elinor	87	“ Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life — your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? ”
32950	32980	32609	32609	Elinor	87	“ Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . ”
32981	32992	32994	32994	Elinor	87	“ Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , ”
32996	33004	32994	32994	Elinor	87	“ she is not at all altered . ”
33005	33018	32609	32609	Elinor	87	“ She is only grown a little more grave than she was . ”
33019	33024	33026	33026	Marianne	88	“ Nay , Edward , ”
33028	33042	33026	33026	Marianne	88	“ you need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself . ”
33043	33050	33052	33052	he	1021	“ Why should you think so ! ”
33058	33069	33052	33052	he	1021	“ But gaiety never was a part of my character . ”
33070	33082	33084	33084	Elinor	87	“ Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ’s , ”
33086	33126	33084	33084	Elinor	87	“ I should hardly call her a lively girl — she is very earnest , very eager in all she does — sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation — but she is not often really merry . ”
33127	33134	33052	33052	he	1021	“ I believe you are right , ”
33138	33152	33135	33135	he	1021	“ and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . ”
33153	33165	33167	33167	Elinor	87	“ I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , ”
33169	33244	33167	33167	Elinor	87	“ in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . ”
33245	33255	33257	33257	Marianne	88	“ But I thought it was right , Elinor , ”
33259	33298	33257	33257	Marianne	88	“ to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure . ”
33299	33379	33167	33167	Elinor	87	“ No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? ”
33380	33398	33400	33400	Edward	97	“ You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , ”
33404	33411	33400	33400	Edward	97	“ Do you gain no ground ? ”
33412	33417	33419	33419	Elinor	87	“ Quite the contrary , ”
33426	33430	33431	33431	he	1022	“ My judgment , ”
33434	33519	33431	33431	he	1022	“ is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister ’s . I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! ”
33520	33532	33534	33534	Elinor	87	“ Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , ”
33536	33548	33550	33550	Edward	97	“ She knows her own worth too well for false shame , ”
33552	33589	33550	33550	Edward	97	“ Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . ”
33590	33598	33600	33600	Marianne	88	“ But you would still be reserved , ”
33602	33608	33609	33609	Edward	97	“ and that is worse . ”
33610	33618	33673	33673	she	87	started—“Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ? ”
33619	33624	33673	33673	she	87	“ Yes , very . ”
33625	33632	33634	33634	he	1023	“ I do not understand you , ”
33638	33657	33634	33634	he	1023	“ Reserved!—how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? ”
33678	33719	33673	33673	she	87	“ Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? ”
33919	33931	33933	33933	he	1023	“ I am going into the village to see my horses , ”
33935	33952	33933	33933	he	1023	“ as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . ”
34056	34262	34050	34050	Edward	97	“ You must not enquire too far , Marianne — remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country — the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug — with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility — and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . ”
34263	34273	34275	34275	Marianne	88	“ I am afraid it is but too true , ”
34277	34286	34050	34050	Edward	97	“ but why should you boast of it ? ”
34287	34291	34293	34293	Elinor	87	“ I suspect , ”
34295	34363	34293	34293	Elinor	87	“ that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . ”
34364	34370	34372	34372	Marianne	88	“ It is very true , ”
34374	34450	34372	34372	Marianne	88	“ that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . ”
34451	34456	34458	34458	Edward	97	“ I am convinced , ”
34460	34591	34458	34458	Edward	97	“ that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower — and a troop of tidy , happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world . ”
34677	34689	34690	34690	she	88	“ I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , ”
34693	34720	34690	34690	she	88	“ Is that Fanny ’s hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . ”
34770	34793	34755	34755	He	1037	“ Yes ; it is my sister ’s hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . ”
35167	35177	35179	35179	he	98	“ You must drink tea with us to night , ”
35181	35206	35179	35179	he	98	“ for we shall be quite alone — and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . ”
35213	35224	35226	35226	she	102	“ And who knows but you may raise a dance , ”
35228	35238	35226	35226	she	102	“ And that will tempt you , Miss Marianne . ”
35239	35243	35245	35245	Marianne	88	“ A dance ! ”
35247	35255	35245	35245	Marianne	88	“ Impossible ! Who is to dance ? ”
35256	35288	35226	35226	she	102	“ Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.—What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! ”
35289	35297	35299	35300	Sir John	98	“ I wish with all my soul , ”
35302	35310	35299	35300	Sir John	98	“ that Willoughby were among us again . ”
35324	35330	35332	35332	he	98	“ And who is Willoughby ? ”
35408	35421	35395	35395	he	98	“ I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? ”
35422	35428	35395	35395	he	98	“ What do you mean ? ”
35429	35435	35395	35395	he	98	“ Shall I tell you ? ”
35436	35439	35395	35395	he	98	“ Certainly . ”
35440	35451	35452	35452	Marianne	88	“ Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . ”
35481	35504	35459	35459	she	88	“ Oh , Edward ! How can you?—But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . ”
35505	35512	35514	35514	he	98	“ I do not doubt it , ”
36098	36104	36106	36107	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ I think , Edward , ”
36118	36199	36106	36107	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it — you would not be able to give them so much of your time . But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least — you would know where to go when you left them . ”
36200	36206	36207	36207	he	1065	“ I do assure you , ”
36210	36523	36207	36207	he	1065	“ that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it — and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . ”
36524	36536	36538	36539	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , ”
36541	36573	36538	36539	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella ’s . ”
36574	36581	36583	36583	he	1066	“ They will be brought up , ”
36590	36613	36583	36583	he	1066	“ to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing . ”
36614	36752	36538	36539	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience — or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ? ”
36753	36757	36759	36759	Edward	97	“ I think , ”
36761	36775	36759	36759	Edward	97	“ that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . ”
37457	37460	37462	37462	he	98	“ Well , ”
37464	37478	37462	37462	he	98	“ we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? ”
37479	37487	37523	37523	Elinor	87	“ Hush ! they will hear you . ”
37488	37521	37523	37523	Elinor	87	“ Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . ”
37546	37567	37540	37540	she	87	“ Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open . ”
37568	37576	37577	37577	They	1090	“ She is walking , I believe . ”
37610	37737	37603	37603	She	102	“ How do you do , my dear ? How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you . Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again — ”
38032	38117	38118	38119	Mr. Palmer	128	“ Well ! what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mama , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma’am ! ( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? ”
38136	38144	38146	38146	she	127	“ Mr. Palmer does not hear me , ”
38150	38161	38146	38146	she	127	“ he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous ! ”
38269	38282	38284	38285	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ You may believe how glad we all were to see them , ”
38321	38408	38300	38300	she	102	“ but , however , I ca n’t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! ”
38423	38432	38434	38435	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ She expects to be confined in February , ”
38464	38471	38472	38472	he	128	“ No , none at all , ”
38479	38484	38486	38487	Sir John	98	“ Here comes Marianne , ”
38489	38502	38503	38503	He	128	“ Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . ”
38603	38642	38596	38596	She	127	“ Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . ”
38690	38699	38701	38702	his wife	279	“ My love , have you been asleep ? ”
38914	38921	38923	38923	Marianne	88	“ Why should they ask us ? ”
38932	38974	38923	38923	Marianne	88	“ The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . ”
38975	38989	38991	38991	Elinor	87	“ They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , ”
38993	39036	38991	38991	Elinor	87	“ by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . ”
39097	39106	39108	39108	she	127	“ I am so glad to see you ! ”
39117	39238	39108	39108	she	127	“ for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton . He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope . ”
39251	39257	39259	39260	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ Not go to town ! ”
39266	39335	39259	39260	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ I shall be quite disappointed if you do not . I could get the nicest house in the world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public . ”
39349	39355	39357	39358	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ Oh , my love , ”
39368	39384	39385	39385	Her	127	room—“you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter . ”
39405	39412	39414	39414	he	318	“ How horrid all this is ! ”
39416	39483	39414	39414	he	318	“ Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . It makes one detest all one ’s acquaintance . What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house ? How few people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather . ”
39493	39501	39503	39504	Sir John	98	“ I am afraid , Miss Marianne , ”
39506	39521	39503	39504	Sir John	98	“ you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . ”
39530	39541	39543	39544	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ Oh , do n’t be so sly before us , ”
39546	39599	39543	39544	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome . We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say . ”
39600	39605	39607	39608	her husband	318	“ Much nearer thirty , ”
39610	39638	39607	39608	her husband	318	“ Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place . ”
39639	39652	39654	39655	Mr. Palmer	128	“ As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life , ”
39673	39679	39681	39682	Mrs. Palmer—“then	131	“ Is it very ugly ? ”
39682	39696	39681	39682	Mrs. Palmer—“then	131	Palmer—“then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose . ”
39719	39723	39725	39725	he	98	“ My dear , ”
39730	39755	39725	39725	he	98	“ it is very provoking that we should be so few . Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? ”
39756	39788	39725	39725	he	98	“ Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? They dined with us last . ”
39789	39797	39799	39800	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ You and I , Sir John , ”
39802	39810	39799	39800	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ should not stand upon such ceremony . ”
39811	39821	39823	39824	Mr. Palmer	128	“ Then you would be very ill - bred , ”
39826	39834	39839	39839	her	279	“ My love you contradict every body , ”
39843	39853	39839	39839	her	279	“ Do you know that you are quite rude ? ”
39854	39871	39799	39800	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred . ”
39872	39883	39885	39890	the good - natured old lady	1138	“ Ay , you may abuse me as you please , ”
39892	39919	39885	39890	the good - natured old lady	1138	“ you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and can not give her back again . So there I have the whip hand of you . ”
40009	40016	40018	40018	she	126	“ Mr. Palmer is so droll ! ”
40027	40035	40018	40018	she	126	“ He is always out of humour . ”
40210	40218	40220	40221	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood , ”
40225	40281	40220	40221	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do,—and come while the Westons are with us . You can not think how happy I shall be ! It will be quite delightful!—My love , ”
40287	40301	40220	40221	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ do n’t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ? ”
40302	40305	40306	40306	he	318	“ Certainly , ”
40311	40320	40220	40221	Mrs. Palmer	127	sneer—“I came into Devonshire with no other view . ”
40321	40323	40220	40221	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ There now,”—said
40327	40343	40306	40306	he	318	“ you see Mr. Palmer expects you ; so you can not refuse to come . ”
40353	40462	40463	40463	Elinor	87	“ But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things . The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . ”
40480	40487	40489	40489	Charlotte	126	“ How charming it will be , ”
40491	40547	40489	40489	Charlotte	126	“ when he is in Parliament!—won’t it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.—But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he wo n’t . Do n’t you , Mr. Palmer ? ”
40556	40566	40567	40567	she	126	“ He can not bear writing , you know , ”
40568	40575	40489	40489	Charlotte	126	continued—“he says it is quite shocking . ”
40576	40579	40581	40581	he	128	“ No , ”
40583	40603	40581	40581	he	128	“ I never said any thing so irrational . Do n’t palm all your abuses of language upon me . ”
40604	40654	40655	40655	She	126	“ There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him ! Sometimes he wo n’t speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll — all about any thing in the world . ”
40681	40684	40686	40686	Elinor	87	“ Certainly , ”
40688	40694	40686	40686	Elinor	87	“ he seems very agreeable . ”
40695	40758	40759	40759	Elinor	87	“ Well — I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n’t think how disappointed he will be if you do n’t come to Cleveland.—I ca n’t imagine why you should object to it . ”
40873	40885	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well , ”
40888	41059	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	Palmer;—“Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before;—but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . ”
41060	41065	41067	41067	Elinor	87	“ Upon my word , ”
41069	41092	41067	41067	Elinor	87	“ you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . ”
41093	41125	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ Do n’t pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town . ”
41126	41132	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ My dear Mrs. Palmer ! ”
41133	41163	41067	41067	Elinor	87	“ Upon my honour I did.—I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . ”
41164	41216	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken . To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . ”
41217	41344	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ‘ So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . ’ ”
41345	41353	41067	41067	Elinor	87	“ And what did the Colonel say ? ”
41354	41402	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ Oh — he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ? ”
41403	41412	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? ”
41413	41438	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you . ”
41439	41460	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . ”
41461	41521	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ So do I. He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mama says he was in love with your sister too . I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . ”
41522	41534	41536	41536	Elinor	87	“ Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? ”
41538	41690	41536	41536	Elinor	87	“ Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I do n’t think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . ”
41717	41729	40887	40888	Mrs. Palmer;—“Not	133	“ I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , ”
41731	41812	41536	41536	Elinor	87	Charlotte.—“And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You ca n’t think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts . ”
41813	41827	41536	41536	Elinor	87	“ You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? ”
41828	41854	41855	41855	she	1156	“ Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married . He was a particular friend of Sir John ’s . I believe , ”
41862	41919	41855	41855	she	1156	“ he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . ”
41920	41948	41536	41536	Elinor	87	“ Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John ’s proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ? ”
41949	42012	41855	41855	she	1156	“ Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . ”
42590	42595	42573	42574	philanthropic man	1188	“ Do come now , ”
42597	42759	42573	42574	philanthropic man	1188	he—“pray come — you must come — I declare you shall come — You ca n’t think how you will like them . Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance . And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . You will be delighted with them I am sure . They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . You are my cousins , and they are my wife ’s , so you must be related . ”
43203	43211	43213	43213	she	99	“ John is in such spirits today ! ”
43229	43236	43256	43256	she	99	window—“He is full of monkey tricks . ”
43260	43266	43256	43256	she	99	“ How playful William is ! ”
43267	43276	43277	43277	she	99	“ And here is my sweet little Annamaria , ”
43302	43321	43277	43277	she	99	“ And she is always so gentle and quiet — Never was there such a quiet little thing ! ”
43625	43630	43632	43633	Miss Steele	137	“ Poor little creatures ! ”
43642	43652	43632	43633	Miss Steele	137	“ It might have been a very sad accident . ”
43653	43660	43662	43662	Marianne	88	“ Yet I hardly know how , ”
43664	43695	43662	43662	Marianne	88	“ unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . ”
43696	43705	43707	43708	Lucy Steele	137	“ What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! ”
43779	43785	43787	43789	the elder sister	1222	“ And Sir John too , ”
43791	43799	43787	43789	the elder sister	1222	“ what a charming man he is ! ”
43832	43869	43820	43820	She	1222	“ And what a charming little family they have ! I never saw such fine children in my life.—I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children . ”
43870	43876	43878	43878	Elinor	87	“ I should guess so , ”
43884	43893	43878	43878	Elinor	87	“ from what I have witnessed this morning . ”
43894	43900	43902	43902	Lucy	137	“ I have a notion , ”
43904	43961	43902	43902	Lucy	137	“ you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . ”
43962	43966	43968	43968	Elinor	87	“ I confess , ”
43970	43991	43968	43968	Elinor	87	“ that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . ”
44022	44043	44004	44005	Miss Steele	137	“ And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . ”
44072	44084	44086	44087	Miss Steele	137	“ Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? ”
44089	44099	44101	44101	Lucy	137	“ We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , ”
44117	44126	44128	44128	Elinor	87	“ I think every one must admire it , ”
44130	44155	44128	44128	Elinor	87	“ who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . ”
44156	44194	44101	44101	Lucy	137	“ And had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . ”
44195	44202	44204	44204	Lucy	137	“ But why should you think , ”
44212	44227	44204	44204	Lucy	137	“ that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? ”
44228	44426	44101	44101	Lucy	137	“ Nay , my dear , I ’m sure I do n’t pretend to say that there an’t . I ’m sure there ’s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I ca n’t bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there ’s Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen . I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? ”
44427	44432	44434	44434	Elinor	87	“ Upon my word , ”
44436	44486	44434	44434	Elinor	87	“ I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . ”
44487	44509	44101	44101	Lucy	137	“ Oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men ’s being beaux — they have something else to do . ”
44510	44515	44547	44547	she	339	“ Lord ! Anne , ”
44520	44539	44547	44547	she	339	“ you can talk of nothing but beaux;—you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else . ”
44894	44911	44913	44913	she	87	“ ’ Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , ”
44915	44951	44913	44913	she	87	“ and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,—but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . ”
45169	45175	45177	45177	he	98	“ His name is Ferrars , ”
45185	45200	45177	45177	he	98	“ but pray do not tell it , for it ’s a great secret . ”
45201	45204	45206	45207	Miss Steele	137	“ Ferrars ! ”
45209	45249	45206	45207	Miss Steele	137	“ Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ? What ! your sister - in - law ’s brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . ”
45250	45259	45261	45261	Lucy	137	“ How can you say so , Anne ? ”
45275	45302	45261	45261	Lucy	137	“ Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle ’s , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . ”
45312	45329	45261	45261	Lucy	137	“ And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ? ”
45782	45796	45798	45798	Lucy	137	“ You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , ”
45814	45834	45835	45835	Elinor	87	cottage—“but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law ’s mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? ”
45862	45865	45867	45867	Lucy	137	“ Indeed ! ”
45869	45904	45867	45867	Lucy	137	“ I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? ”
45905	45908	45910	45910	Elinor	87	“ No , ”
45934	45941	45910	45910	Elinor	87	“ I know nothing of her . ”
45942	45961	45963	45963	Lucy	137	“ I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , ”
45972	46007	46008	46008	Elinor	87	“ but perhaps there may be reasons — I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . ”
46044	46148	46030	46030	Lucy	137	“ I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting you ; indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble you . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . ”
46149	46157	46159	46159	Elinor	87	“ I am sorry I do not , ”
46165	46217	46159	46159	Elinor	87	“ if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . ”
46218	46288	46289	46289	She	1258	“ I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present — but the time may come — how soon it will come must depend upon herself — when we may be very intimately connected . ”
46315	46319	46321	46321	Elinor	87	“ Good heavens ! ”
46323	46341	46321	46321	Elinor	87	“ what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? ”
46361	46364	46366	46366	Lucy	137	“ No , ”
46368	46385	46387	46387	her	137	“ not to Mr. Robert Ferrars — I never saw him in my life ; but , ”
46392	46398	46387	46387	her	137	“ to his eldest brother . ”
46476	46483	46485	46485	Lucy	137	“ You may well be surprised , ”
46487	46662	46485	46485	Lucy	137	“ for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . ”—She
46715	46726	46700	46700	she	87	solicitude—“May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? ”
46727	46736	46700	46700	she	87	“ We have been engaged these four years . ”
46737	46741	46700	46700	she	87	“ Four years ! ”
46742	46745	46700	46700	she	87	“ Yes . ”
46759	46765	46767	46767	she	87	“ I did not know , ”
46769	46780	46767	46767	she	87	“ that you were even acquainted till the other day . ”
46781	46808	46700	46700	she	87	“ Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle ’s care , you know , a considerable while . ”
46809	46813	46700	46700	she	87	“ Your uncle ! ”
46814	46830	46700	46700	she	87	“ Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? ”
46831	46837	46839	46839	Elinor	87	“ I think I have , ”
46855	47005	46839	46839	Elinor	87	“ He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been . Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . ”
47006	47009	47011	47011	Elinor	87	“ Certainly , ”
47043	47088	47026	47026	she	87	falsehood—“Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really — I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . ”
47089	47096	47098	47098	Lucy	137	“ We can mean no other , ”
47102	47163	47098	47098	Lucy	137	“ Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . ”
47164	47169	47171	47171	Elinor	87	“ It is strange , ”
47179	47192	47171	47171	Elinor	87	“ that I should never have heard him even mention your name . ”
47193	47269	47270	47270	She	1262	“ No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret . You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister ’s suspecting any thing , that was reason enough for his not mentioning it . ”
47288	47296	47298	47298	she	1262	“ Four years you have been engaged , ”
47304	47330	47298	47298	she	1262	“ Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . ”
47343	47397	47340	47340	she	1262	“ To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.—I have had it above these three years . ”
47461	47468	47470	47470	Lucy	137	“ I have never been able , ”
47472	47513	47470	47470	Lucy	137	“ to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . ”
47514	47522	47524	47524	Elinor	87	“ You are quite in the right , ”
47540	47545	47547	47547	she	87	“ I am sure , ”
47549	47612	47547	47547	she	87	“ I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . ”
47613	47622	47624	47624	Elinor	87	“ I certainly did not seek your confidence , ”
47626	47684	47624	47624	Elinor	87	“ but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . ”
47726	47742	47744	47744	she	87	“ I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , ”
47746	48009	47744	47744	she	87	“ in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward ’s mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t’other day , when Edward ’s name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You ca n’t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward ’s sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom — we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . ”
48025	48028	48030	48030	Lucy	137	“ Sometimes . ”
48037	48056	48062	48062	she	1264	“ I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . ”
48069	48155	48062	48062	she	1264	“ But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it . I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too — so dear as he is to me — I do n’t think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ? ”
48156	48160	48162	48162	Elinor	87	“ Pardon me , ”
48169	48188	48162	48162	Elinor	87	“ but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . ”
48189	48194	48196	48196	Lucy	137	“ To be sure , ”
48207	48270	48196	48196	Lucy	137	“ his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . ”
48271	48287	48162	48162	Elinor	87	“ Did he come from your uncle ’s , then , when he visited us ? ”
48288	48311	48196	48196	Lucy	137	“ Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? ”
48312	48315	48317	48317	Elinor	87	“ No , ”
48333	48353	48317	48317	Elinor	87	“ I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . ”
48385	48396	48398	48398	Lucy	137	“ Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? ”
48400	48413	48398	48398	Lucy	137	“ We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . ”
48414	48489	48366	48366	his	1266	“ I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected . Poor fellow ! I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; ”
48504	48550	48556	48556	his	1268	“ You know his hand , I dare say,—a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual . He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . ”
48666	48672	48674	48674	Lucy	137	“ Writing to each other , ”
48683	48776	48674	48674	Lucy	137	“ is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even that . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? ”
48777	48781	48783	48783	Elinor	87	“ I did , ”
50831	50836	50838	50839	Lady Middleton	99	“ I am glad , ”
50843	50901	50838	50839	Lady Middleton	99	“ you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria ’s basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . ”
50914	50984	50909	50909	herself	137	“ Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . ”
50985	51050	51051	51051	Lucy	137	“ You are very good , I hope it wo n’t hurt your eyes — will you ring the bell for some working candles ? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done . ”
51122	51158	51164	51164	she	88	“ Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me — you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned . ”
51191	51205	51207	51207	Elinor	87	“ Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma’am , ”
51216	51240	51207	51207	Elinor	87	“ and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . ”
51251	51254	51256	51256	Elinor	87	“ Perhaps , ”
51258	51333	51256	51256	Elinor	87	“ if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . ”
51334	51348	51350	51350	Lucy	137	“ Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , ”
51352	51384	51350	51350	Lucy	137	“ for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . ”
51385	51395	51397	51398	Miss Steele	137	“ Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed , ”
51400	51411	51397	51398	Miss Steele	137	“ Dear little soul , how I do love her ! ”
51412	51418	51420	51421	Lady Middleton	99	“ You are very kind , ”
51425	51457	51420	51421	Lady Middleton	99	“ and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? ”
51622	51664	51618	51618	Elinor	87	“ I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . ”
51665	51669	51671	51671	Lucy	137	“ Thank you , ”
51674	51709	51671	51671	Lucy	137	“ for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . ”
51710	51723	51725	51725	Elinor	87	“ Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , ”
51733	51767	51725	51725	Elinor	87	“ nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? ”
51768	51776	51778	51778	Lucy	137	“ And yet I do assure you , ”
51788	51907	51778	51778	Lucy	137	“ there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . ”
51908	51992	51725	51725	Elinor	87	“ Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . ”
51993	52124	51778	51778	Lucy	137	“ He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward ’s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . ”
52125	52186	51778	51778	Lucy	137	“ That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your ’s . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ’ engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . ”
52212	52219	52221	52221	Lucy	137	“ Edward ’s love for me , ”
52223	52286	52221	52221	Lucy	137	“ has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment ’s alarm on that account from the first . ”
52303	52444	52299	52299	Lucy	137	“ I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . ”
52445	52449	52451	52451	Elinor	87	“ All this , ”
52453	52467	52451	52451	Elinor	87	“ is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . ”
52468	52472	52474	52474	she	87	“ But what , ”
52480	52548	52474	52474	she	87	“ are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars ’s death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?—Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? ”
52549	52614	52451	52451	Elinor	87	“ If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward ’s sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . ”
52615	52632	52633	52633	Lucy	137	“ And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . ”
52643	52651	52653	52653	Elinor	87	“ Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? ”
52655	52681	52653	52653	Elinor	87	“ Not at all — I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother — silly and a great coxcomb . ”
52682	52687	52689	52690	Miss Steele	137	“ A great coxcomb ! ”
52707	52722	52689	52690	Miss Steele	137	“ Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . ”
52723	52727	52729	52729	Lucy	137	“ No sister , ”
52731	52745	52729	52729	Lucy	137	“ you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs . ”
52746	52759	52761	52762	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood ’s is not , ”
52767	52806	52761	52762	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who she likes . ”
52807	52810	52812	52813	Miss Steele	137	“ Oh , ”
52821	52840	52812	52813	Miss Steele	137	“ I dare say Lucy ’s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood ’s . ”
52899	53064	52884	52884	Marianne	88	“ I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . ”
53065	53072	53074	53074	Elinor	87	“ I should always be happy , ”
53076	53124	53074	53074	Elinor	87	“ to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood — that must be recommendation enough to her husband . ”
53125	53141	52884	52884	Marianne	88	“ But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward ’s going into orders . ”
53142	53155	53156	53156	They	1314	“ Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . ”
53173	53238	53166	53166	Lucy	137	“ I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? ”
53239	53242	53244	53244	Elinor	87	“ No , ”
53256	53290	53244	53244	Elinor	87	“ on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . ”
53291	53297	53299	53299	Lucy	137	“ Indeed you wrong me , ”
53305	53376	53299	53299	Lucy	137	“ I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ‘ I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ’ I should resolve upon doing it immediately . ”
53391	53435	53377	53377	Elinor	87	“ This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . ”
53436	53446	53448	53448	Lucy	137	“ ’ Tis because you are an indifferent person , ”
53463	53499	53448	53448	Lucy	137	“ that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . ”
53561	53573	53575	53575	she	137	“ Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? ”
53582	53586	53575	53575	she	137	“ Certainly not . ”
53587	53594	53596	53597	the other	775	“ I am sorry for that , ”
53607	53647	53596	53597	the other	775	“ it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . ”
53648	53664	53575	53575	she	137	“ It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . ”
53665	53740	53596	53597	the other	775	“ How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . ”
54285	54502	54270	54271	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I do beg you will favour me with your company , for I ’ve quite set my heart upon it . Do n’t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n’t put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford that . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n’t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . ”
54503	54509	54511	54512	Sir John	98	“ I have a notion , ”
54514	54587	54511	54512	Sir John	98	“ that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . ”
54588	54591	54593	54594	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Nay , ”
54596	54744	54593	54594	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne ’s company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my odd ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . ”
54745	54756	54758	54758	Marianne	88	“ I thank you , ma’am , sincerely thank you , ”
54763	54855	54758	54758	Marianne	88	“ your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,—I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence — Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . ”
55196	55204	55205	55205	she	86	“ I am delighted with the plan , ”
55208	55392	55205	55205	she	86	“ it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you should go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . ”
55393	55403	55405	55405	Elinor	87	“ Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , ”
55407	55441	55405	55405	Elinor	87	“ you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . ”
55447	55451	55453	55454	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ And what , ”
55456	55489	55453	55454	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do not let me hear a word about the expense of it . ”
55490	55527	55536	55537	her mother	332	“ My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings ’s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . ”
55528	55534	55536	55537	her mother	332	“ That is very true , ”
55539	55573	55536	55537	her mother	332	“ but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton . ”
55574	55587	55589	55589	Marianne	88	“ If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , ”
55591	55628	55589	55589	Marianne	88	“ at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . ”
55767	55775	55777	55778	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ I will have you both go , ”
55780	55844	55777	55778	Mrs. Dashwood	86	“ these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law ’s family . ”
55909	55955	55906	55906	she	87	“ I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . ”
57020	57028	57030	57030	Elinor	87	“ I am writing home , Marianne , ”
57032	57046	57030	57030	Elinor	87	“ had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? ”
57047	57058	57060	57060	Marianne	88	“ I am not going to write to my mother , ”
57446	57459	57440	57440	she	88	“ Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! ”
57584	57590	57592	57592	he	105	“ Is your sister ill ? ”
57774	57777	57778	57778	he	105	“ Yes , ”
57785	57816	57778	57778	he	105	“ almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . ”
57882	57887	57889	57889	she	102	“ Oh ! Colonel , ”
57897	58013	57889	57889	she	102	“ I am monstrous glad to see you — sorry I could not come before — beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with . Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? ”
58014	58033	57892	57892	her	102	“ I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer ’s , where I have been dining . ”
58034	58069	57892	57892	her	102	“ Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . ”
58070	58095	57889	57889	she	102	“ Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . ”
58096	58275	58276	58276	He	1411	“ Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see — that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too — which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome — worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I do n’t know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let ’s have no secrets among friends . ”
58498	58509	58511	58511	she	127	“ Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , ”
58513	58543	58511	58511	she	127	“ What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! ”
58848	58862	58864	58864	she	87	“ Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? ”
58882	58890	58891	58891	she	87	“ Are you quite sure of it ? ”
58894	58911	58912	58913	The man	506	“ Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? ”
58919	58924	58926	58926	she	87	“ How very odd ! ”
58943	58949	58953	58953	herself	87	“ How odd , indeed ! ”
58961	59061	59062	59062	She	87	“ If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! I long to inquire ; and how will my interference be borne . ”
59277	59286	59288	59289	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ If this open weather holds much longer , ”
59300	59346	59288	59289	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ’ tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day ’s pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . ”
59347	59352	59354	59354	Marianne	88	“ That is true , ”
59375	59393	59354	59354	Marianne	88	“ I had not thought of that . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . ”
59409	59418	59419	59419	she	88	“ It is charming weather for them indeed , ”
59435	59444	59419	59419	she	88	“ How much they must enjoy it ! But ”
59453	59524	59419	59419	she	88	“ it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer — nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! ”
59525	59530	59532	59532	Elinor	87	“ At any rate , ”
59551	59572	59537	59538	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . ”
59573	59593	59532	59532	Elinor	87	“ Ay , my dear , I ’ll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . ”
59594	59598	59601	59601	Elinor	87	“ And now , ”
59603	59615	59601	59601	Elinor	87	“ she will write to Combe by this day ’s post . ”
59755	59824	59825	59825	Elinor	87	“ Do n’t you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . ”
60136	60140	60142	60142	Marianne	88	“ Good God ! ”
60144	60154	60142	60142	Marianne	88	“ he has been here while we were out . ”
60172	60183	60155	60155	Elinor	87	“ Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . ”
60334	60338	60340	60340	Marianne	88	“ For me ! ”
60346	60355	60340	60340	Marianne	88	“ No , ma’am , for my mistress . ”
60367	60378	60357	60357	Marianne	88	“ It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! ”
60379	60388	60390	60390	Elinor	87	“ You are expecting a letter , then ? ”
60398	60407	60390	60390	Elinor	87	“ Yes , a little — not much . ”
60413	60423	60390	60390	Elinor	87	“ You have no confidence in me , Marianne . ”
60424	60442	60357	60357	Marianne	88	“ Nay , Elinor , this reproach from you — you who have confidence in no one ! ”
60443	60446	60448	60448	Elinor	87	“ Me ! ”
60453	60464	60448	60448	Elinor	87	“ indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . ”
60465	60469	60471	60471	Marianne	88	“ Nor I , ”
60475	60508	60471	60471	Marianne	88	“ our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . ”
61010	61019	61021	61021	he	128	“ I thought you were both in Devonshire , ”
61023	61027	61029	61029	Elinor	87	“ Did you ? ”
61031	61039	61029	61029	Elinor	87	“ When do you go back again ? ”
61040	61046	61055	61055	Marianne	88	“ I do not know . ”
61091	61096	61098	61099	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Aye , aye , ”
61101	61157	61098	61099	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . ”
61158	61161	61163	61163	Marianne	88	“ Invited ! ”
61165	61187	61188	61188	Marianne	88	“ So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . ”
61521	61530	61574	61574	his	105	“ your sister looks unwell to - day , ”
61532	61540	61541	61541	he	105	“ your sister seems out of spirits , ”
61636	61649	61628	61628	He	105	“ your sister ’s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . ”
61650	61658	61660	61660	Elinor	87	“ It can not be generally known , ”
61662	61672	61673	61673	He	105	“ for her own family do not know it . ”
61679	61716	61673	61673	He	105	“ I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . ”
61717	61732	61633	61633	he	105	“ How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? ”
61733	61933	61945	61945	his	1488	“ By many — by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister ’s writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to — ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . ”
62169	62187	62157	62157	his	105	“ to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,”—took
62713	62717	62718	62718	she	87	“ Good heavens ! ”
62721	62748	62718	62718	she	87	“ he is there — he is there — Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not I speak to him ? ”
62749	62756	62758	62758	Elinor	87	“ Pray , pray be composed , ”
62760	62781	62758	62758	Elinor	87	“ and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . ”
62956	62984	62945	62945	she	87	“ Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ? ”
63044	63086	63039	63039	he	1504	“ I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope . ”
63087	63096	63098	63098	Marianne	88	“ But have you not received my notes ? ”
63104	63142	63098	63098	Marianne	88	“ Here is some mistake I am sure — some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven ’s sake tell me , what is the matter ? ”
63194	63221	63185	63185	he	1504	“ Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , ”
63279	63286	63287	63287	she	88	“ Go to him , Elinor , ”
63297	63350	63287	63287	she	88	“ and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again — must speak to him instantly.—I can not rest — I shall not have a moment ’s peace till this is explained — some dreadful misapprehension or other . Oh , go to him this moment . ”
63351	63381	63386	63386	she	88	“ How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations . Wait only till tomorrow . ”
64054	64062	64016	64016	Elinor	87	“ Marianne , may I ask — ? ”
64063	64068	64069	64069	she	87	“ No , Elinor , ”
64072	64082	64069	64069	she	87	“ ask nothing ; you will soon know all . ”
64557	64647	64554	64554	she	87	“ Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! My girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n’t keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? ”
64681	64760	64662	64662	herself	87	“ And have you really , Ma’am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister ’s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . ”
64761	64906	64954	64955	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Do n’t we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n’t do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . ”
64907	64912	64914	64914	Elinor	87	“ Indeed , Ma’am , ”
64919	64953	64914	64914	Elinor	87	“ you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . ”
65168	65178	65179	65179	I	0	“ Bond Street , January . MY DEAR MADAM , “
65428	65435	65436	65436	Your	88	“ I am , dear Madam , “
65439	65443	65444	65445	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	157	“ humble servant , “
65447	66047	65444	65445	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	157	” With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood , may be imagined . Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling — so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever — a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings ’s chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . Mrs. Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness . A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , “
66057	66058	66059	66059	I	0	” “
66063	66068	65444	65445	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	157	” replied her sister , “
66085	66114	66117	66117	Elinor	87	” This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , “
66125	66148	66117	66117	Elinor	87	” before her voice was entirely lost in sobs . Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . “
66155	66159	66150	66150	yourself	87	” she cried , “
66193	66194	66195	66195	I	0	” “
66203	66207	66195	66195	I	0	” cried Marianne ; “
66270	66271	66273	66273	you	87	” “
66300	66301	66286	66286	you	87	” “
66308	66318	66303	66303	me	0	” throwing her arms round her sister ’s neck ; “
66361	66362	66344	66344	Edward	97	” “
66368	66374	66344	66344	Edward	97	” said Elinor , solemnly . “
66381	66386	66387	66387	he	1540	” cried Marianne wildly , “
66401	66402	66395	66395	You	87	” “
66416	66417	66409	66409	I	0	” “
66436	66437	66426	66426	Mine	0	” “
66539	66540	66511	66511	he	1540	” “
66543	66547	66511	66511	he	1540	” cried Marianne , “
66554	66555	66511	66511	he	1540	” “
66559	66560	66563	66563	he	1540	” “
66581	66582	66573	66573	He	1540	” “
66592	66593	66584	66584	he	1540	” “
66624	66625	66613	66613	I	0	” “
66632	66633	66627	66627	you	87	” “
66652	66710	66647	66647	I	0	” Elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all . The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . “
66802	66804	66805	66805	Her	102	“ M.D. ”
66830	67006	66805	66805	Her	102	“ I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . We were last night at Lady Middleton ’s , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . “
67008	67021	66805	66805	Her	102	” The contents of her last note to him were these : — “
67305	67307	67287	67287	you	157	“ M.D. ”
67420	67425	67426	67426	she	87	“ I felt myself , ”
67429	67451	67426	67426	she	87	“ to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . ”
67452	67458	67460	67460	Elinor	87	“ I can believe it , ”
67462	67472	67426	67426	she	87	“ but unfortunately he did not feel the same . ”
67473	67619	67639	67639	she	1549	“ He did feel the same , Elinor — for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again — his distress — can I ever forget his distress ? ”
67647	67661	67639	67639	she	1549	“ Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . ”
67662	67678	67639	67639	she	1549	“ Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? ”
67679	67786	67639	67639	she	1549	“ By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes — whoever she be — or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ? ”
67796	67848	67639	67639	she	1549	“ Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . ”
67849	67854	67856	67856	Marianne	159	“ No , no , ”
67858	67943	67856	67856	Marianne	159	“ misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like — may resist insult , or return mortification — but I can not . I must feel — I must be wretched — and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . ”
67944	67954	67639	67639	she	1549	“ But for my mother ’s sake and mine — ”
67955	67982	67639	67639	she	1549	“ I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable — Oh ! who can require it ? ”
68064	68178	68026	68026	Marianne	159	“ It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel — nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me — ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ‘ The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me’—That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent!—Elinor , can he be justified ? ”
68179	68189	68432	68432	Elinor	87	“ No , Marianne , in no possible way . ”
68190	68252	68432	68432	Elinor	87	“ And yet this woman — who knows what her art may have been?—how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!—Who is she?—Who can she be?—Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?—Oh ! no one , no one — he talked to me only of myself . ”
68267	68291	68257	68257	Marianne	159	“ Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? ”
68292	68299	68432	68432	Elinor	87	“ To - morrow , Marianne ! ”
68300	68328	68432	68432	Elinor	87	“ Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby ’s sake — and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? ”
68329	68364	68432	68432	Elinor	87	“ It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . ”
68365	68431	68432	68432	Elinor	87	“ Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers — how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would he say to that ! ”
68581	68587	68588	68588	she	102	“ How do you do my dear?”—said
68608	68883	68884	68884	She	1554	“ How is she , Miss Dashwood ? Poor thing ! she looks very bad . No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon — a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men ’s going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n’t disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . ”
68935	68959	68960	68960	Elinor	87	“ no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . ”
69351	69355	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Poor soul ! ”
69367	69483	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things ! — ”
69484	69501	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ The lady then — Miss Grey I think you called her — is very rich ? ”
69502	69727	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n’t come before it ’s wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it do n’t signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why do n’t he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that wo n’t do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . ”
69728	69748	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? ”
69749	69810	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . ”
69811	69818	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ And who are the Ellisons ? ”
69819	69847	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made!—What now , ”
69851	69936	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	moment—“your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? ”
69937	69983	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Dear ma’am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . ”
69984	70169	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . ”
70170	70265	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . ”
70266	70391	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ’ tis blown over and forgot . And what good does talking ever do you know ? ”
70392	70461	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do this justice to Mr. Willoughby — he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . ”
70462	70501	69357	69358	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Law , my dear ! Do n’t pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! ”
70572	70961	70564	70564	her	102	“ Well , my dear , ’ tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an’t married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he ’ll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback — except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ’ prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ’ tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! ’ tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone ’s throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we can but put Willoughby out of her head ! ”
70962	70973	70975	70975	Elinor	87	“ Ay , if we can do that , Ma’am , ”
70977	70989	70975	70975	Elinor	87	“ we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . ”
71041	71048	71054	71055	her sister	339	“ You had better leave me , ”
71060	71066	71068	71068	Elinor	87	“ I will leave you , ”
71070	71078	71068	71068	Elinor	87	“ if you will go to bed . ”
71177	71181	71183	71183	she	102	“ My dear , ”
71187	71266	71183	71183	she	102	“ I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . ”
71267	71271	71273	71273	Elinor	87	“ Dear Ma’am , ”
71288	71341	71342	71343	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . ”
71500	71524	71483	71483	she	102	“ The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . ”
71554	71560	71562	71562	she	102	“ Marianne is not well , ”
71564	71582	71562	71562	she	102	“ She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . ”
71583	71588	71589	71589	he	103	“ Perhaps , then , ”
71593	71617	71589	71589	he	103	“ what I heard this morning may be — there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . ”
71618	71624	71562	71562	she	102	“ What did you hear ? ”
71625	71674	71562	71562	she	102	“ That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think — in short , that a man , whom I knew to be engaged — but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . ”
71675	71679	71681	71681	Elinor	87	“ You mean , ”
71687	71736	71681	71681	Elinor	87	“ Mr. Willoughby ’s marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we do know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? ”
71737	71952	71562	71562	she	102	“ In a stationer ’s shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey — it was no longer to be a secret — it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more:—as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment!—but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey ’s guardian . ”
71953	71984	71681	71681	Elinor	87	“ It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . ”
71985	71999	71681	71681	Elinor	87	“ It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable — at least I think”—he
72015	72024	71681	71681	Elinor	87	“ And your sister — how did she — ”
72025	72109	71681	71681	Elinor	87	“ Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps — but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . ”
72110	72113	72115	72116	Colonel Brandon	103	“ Ah ! ”
72118	72145	72115	72116	Colonel Brandon	103	“ there is , indeed ! But your sister does not — I think you said so — she does not consider quite as you do ? ”
72146	72166	72167	72167	He	103	“ You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . ”
72488	72500	72501	72501	she	88	“ No , no , no , it can not be , ”
72504	72542	72501	72501	she	88	“ she can not feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . ”
72757	72776	72750	72750	she	88	“ Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . ”
73362	73368	73370	73370	Elinor	87	“ Who can this be ? ”
73372	73384	73370	73370	Elinor	87	“ So early too ! I thought we had been safe . ”
73391	73397	73399	73399	she	88	“ It is Colonel Brandon ! ”
73404	73412	73399	73399	she	88	“ We are never safe from him . ”
73413	73427	73370	73370	Elinor	87	“ He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . ”
73428	73436	73399	73399	she	88	“ I will not trust to that , ”
73443	73466	73399	73399	she	88	“ A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . ”
73537	73546	73548	73548	he	103	“ I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , ”
73555	73718	73548	73548	he	103	“ and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object — my wish — my sole wish in desiring it — I hope , I believe it is — is to be a means of giving comfort;—no , I must not say comfort — not present comfort — but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister ’s mind . My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother — will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere regard — nothing but an earnest desire of being useful — I think I am justified — though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ? ”
73722	73727	73729	73729	Elinor	87	“ I understand you , ”
73731	73797	73729	73729	Elinor	87	“ You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne . My gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and hers must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . ”
73798	73872	73548	73548	he	103	“ You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,—but this will give you no idea — I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it shall be a short one . On such a subject , ”
73876	73886	73887	73887	He	1606	“ can I have little temptation to be diffuse . ”
73904	73965	73887	73887	He	1606	“ You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation—(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)—a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park — it was the evening of a dance — in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . ”
73966	73969	73971	73971	Elinor	87	“ Indeed , ”
73973	73980	73981	73981	He	1606	“ I have not forgotten it . ”
73991	74605	74606	74606	he	1607	“ If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Hers , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married — married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing — but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin ’s maid betrayed us . I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father ’s point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one — but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon ’s , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps — but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , ”
74616	74656	74606	74606	he	1607	“ was of trifling weight — was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was that which threw this gloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered — ”
74731	75115	75117	75117	he	1609	“ It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I did arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I did find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , in the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered — so faded — worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her — but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it — I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was — yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . ”
75143	75155	75157	75157	he	1609	“ Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , ”
75159	75748	75157	75157	he	1609	“ by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood — a subject such as this — untouched for fourteen years — it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I will be more collected — more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter — better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter ’s being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too . ”
75749	75753	75755	75755	Elinor	87	“ Good heavens ! ”
75757	75765	75755	75755	Elinor	87	“ could it be — could Willoughby ! ”
75767	75777	75778	75778	he	1611	“ The first news that reached me of her , ”
75781	75995	75778	75778	he	1611	“ came in a letter from herself , last October . It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but had he known it , what would it have availed ? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ? No , he had already done that , which no man who can feel for another would do . He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her . ”
75996	76003	76005	76005	Elinor	87	“ This is beyond every thing ! ”
76007	76420	76005	76005	Elinor	87	“ His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it was known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister — but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister ’s influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . ”
76452	76459	76461	76461	she	87	“ I have been more pained , ”
76463	76515	76516	76516	she	87	“ by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , ”
76524	76536	76516	76516	she	87	“ ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? ”
76537	76540	76541	76541	he	1612	“ Yes , ”
76545	76555	76541	76541	he	1612	“ once I have . One meeting was unavoidable . ”
76570	76579	76556	76556	Elinor	87	“ What ? have you met him to — ”
76580	76649	76650	76650	Elinor	87	“ I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . ”
76673	76676	76678	76679	Colonel Brandon	103	“ Such , ”
76685	76708	76678	76679	Colonel Brandon	103	“ has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! ”
76709	76716	76761	76761	he	103	“ Is she still in town ? ”
76717	76754	76761	76761	he	103	“ No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . ”
77845	77980	77981	77982	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly ’s puppies ! and this was the end of it ! ”
77992	78083	77981	77982	Mrs. Palmer	127	“ She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . ”
78306	78314	78283	78283	her	99	“ It is very shocking , indeed ! ”
78996	79012	79014	79014	she	87	“ I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here still , ”
79025	79134	79014	79014	she	87	“ But I always thought I should . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you told me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a month . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word . ”
79159	79165	79167	79168	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Well , my dear , ”
79170	79177	79167	79168	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ and how did you travel ? ”
79178	79188	79190	79191	Miss Steele	137	“ Not in the stage , I assure you , ”
79197	79253	79190	79191	Miss Steele	137	“ we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we ’d join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . ”
79254	79259	79261	79262	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Oh , oh ! ”
79264	79282	79261	79262	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . ”
79283	79287	79289	79290	Miss Steele	137	“ There now , ”
79295	79395	79289	79290	Miss Steele	137	“ everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour ’s end to another . ‘ Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ’ my cousin said t’other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I — I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . ”
79396	79422	79430	79431	her cousin	1668	“ Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking — but it wo n’t do — the Doctor is the man , I see . ”
79423	79428	79430	79431	her cousin	1668	“ No , indeed ! ”
79437	79454	79430	79431	her cousin	1668	“ and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . ”
79477	79500	79502	79502	Lucy	137	“ I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , ”
79517	79527	79502	79502	Lucy	137	“ No , I do not think we shall . ”
79528	79539	79540	79540	Elinor	87	“ Oh , yes , I dare say you will . ”
79549	79570	79540	79540	Elinor	87	“ What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! ”
79571	79578	79580	79581	Mrs. Jennings	102	“ Long a time , indeed ! ”
79583	79593	79594	79594	Lucy	137	“ Why , their visit is but just begun ! ”
79598	79612	79614	79615	Miss Steele	137	“ I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , ”
79617	79626	79614	79615	Miss Steele	137	“ I am sorry she is not well — ”
79637	79680	79628	79628	Marianne	88	“ You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . ”
79681	79717	79718	79718	Elinor	87	“ Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!—I think she might see us ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . ”
79753	79761	79763	79764	Miss Steele	137	“ Oh , if that ’s all , ”
79766	79777	79763	79764	Miss Steele	137	“ we can just as well go and see her . ”
80494	80505	80507	80507	he	1687	“ I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , ”
80509	80673	80507	80507	he	1687	“ but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . This morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to them . As my mother - in - law ’s relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . ”
80674	80697	80822	80822	Elinor	87	“ Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . ”
80698	80821	80822	80822	Elinor	87	“ I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . ”
80933	80955	80912	80912	He	342	“ but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . ”
81118	81131	81114	81114	his	342	“ Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ? ”
81132	81143	81072	81072	he	342	“ Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . ”
81144	81179	81237	81237	himself	1705	“ I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . ”
81180	81190	81246	81246	he	1705	“ Me , brother ! what do you mean ? ”
81191	81215	81246	81246	he	1705	“ He likes you . I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ? ”
81216	81225	81246	81246	he	1705	“ I believe about two thousand a year . ”
81226	81233	81246	81246	he	1705	“ Two thousand a - year ; ”
81249	81268	81246	81246	he	1705	“ Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were twice as much , for your sake . ”
81269	81275	81277	81277	Elinor	87	“ Indeed I believe you , ”
81279	81297	81277	81277	Elinor	87	“ but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me . ”
81298	81483	81484	81484	his	1706	“ You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side — in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable — you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that”—lowering
81489	81497	81503	81503	he	1706	whisper—“will be exceedingly welcome to all parties . ”
81506	81577	81503	81503	he	1706	“ That is , I mean to say — your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . ”
81585	81594	81595	81595	he	1706	“ It would be something remarkable , now , ”
81598	81626	81595	81595	he	1706	“ something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . ”
81627	81633	81635	81635	Elinor	87	“ Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , ”
81640	81646	81635	81635	Elinor	87	“ going to be married ? ”
81647	81838	81839	81839	He	1707	“ It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality:—The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny ’s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . ”
81854	81875	81848	81848	she	1708	“ Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . ”
81876	82027	81635	81635	Elinor	87	“ Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it has cost me a vast deal of money . ”
82028	82039	81839	81839	He	1707	“ More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . ”
82040	82120	82121	82121	Elinor	87	“ Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker ’s hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . ”
82126	82258	82121	82121	Elinor	87	“ Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars ’s kindness is . ”
82259	82262	82264	82264	Elinor	87	“ Certainly , ”
82266	82285	82264	82264	Elinor	87	“ and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . ”
82286	82297	82298	82298	he	1709	“ Another year or two may do much towards it , ”
82302	82341	82298	82298	he	1709	“ but however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny ’s green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . ”
82342	82352	82264	82264	Elinor	87	“ Where is the green - house to be ? ”
82353	82422	82423	82423	Elinor	87	“ Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . ”
82508	82607	82494	82494	he	1709	“ She seems a most valuable woman indeed . Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous . Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten . She must have a great deal to leave . ”
82608	82632	82494	82494	he	1709	“ Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . ”
82633	82670	82494	82494	he	1709	“ But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . ”
82671	82693	82494	82494	he	1709	“ And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? ”
82694	82787	82494	82494	he	1709	“ Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . ”
82788	82814	82494	82494	he	1709	“ But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . ”
82815	82822	82824	82824	he	1713	“ Why , to be sure , ”
82831	82874	82824	82824	he	1713	“ people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne?—she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ? ”
82875	82893	82494	82494	he	1709	“ She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks . ”
82894	83090	83091	83091	Elinor	87	“ I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! Hers has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of you , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne now , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if you do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . ”
83287	83299	83301	83301	he	83	“ I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , ”
83311	83451	83301	83301	he	83	“ Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting her , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . ”
84526	84534	84536	84536	Lucy	137	“ Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! ”
84565	84610	84611	84611	Elinor	87	time:—“there is nobody here but you , that can feel for me . I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious ! In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on — that is to be my mother ! ”
85619	85628	85630	85630	he	103	“ These are done by my eldest sister , ”
85632	85681	85630	85630	he	103	“ and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . ”
85785	85786	85782	85783	Miss Dashwood	106	“ Hum”—said
85788	85789	85782	85783	Miss Dashwood	106	Ferrars—“very pretty,”—and
85825	85836	85821	85821	she	91	“ They are very pretty , ma’am — an’t they ? ”
85863	85891	85859	85859	she	91	“ Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton ’s style of painting , Ma’am?—She does paint most delightfully!—How beautifully her last landscape is done ! ”
85892	85903	85904	85904	Marianne	88	“ Beautifully indeed ! But she does every thing well . ”
85953	85984	85932	85932	she	91	“ This is admiration of a very particular kind!—what is Miss Morton to us?—who knows , or who cares , for her?—it is Elinor of whom we think and speak . ”
86037	86046	86023	86023	herself	91	“ Miss Morton is Lord Morton ’s daughter . ”
86221	86240	86241	86241	She	97	“ Dear , dear Elinor , do n’t mind them . Do n’t let them make you unhappy . ”
86299	86305	86293	86293	Jennings	102	“ Ah ! poor dear , ”
86398	86402	86404	86405	her brother	342	“ Poor Marianne ! ”
86424	86499	86418	86418	he	342	“ She has not such good health as her sister,—she is very nervous,—she has not Elinor ’s constitution;—and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne was remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor . Now you see it is all gone . ”
86819	86824	86826	86826	Lucy	137	“ My dear friend , ”
86836	86932	86826	86826	Lucy	137	“ I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars ’s way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was ! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ; but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so ? You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? ”
86933	86942	87029	87029	she	87	“ She was certainly very civil to you . ”
86943	86985	86986	86986	Elinor	87	“ Civil!—Did you see nothing but only civility?—I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!—No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same — all sweetness and affability ! ”
87017	87027	87029	87029	she	87	“ Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , ”
87031	87049	87029	87029	she	87	“ nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;—but as that was not the case — ”
87050	87056	87057	87057	Lucy	137	“ I guessed you would say so,”—replied
87058	87156	87029	87029	she	87	quickly—“but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You sha n’t talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed!—I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! ”
87172	87190	87159	87159	Elinor	87	“ Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?—you seem low — you do n’t speak;—sure you an’t well . ”
87191	87199	87057	87057	Lucy	137	“ I never was in better health . ”
87200	87251	87252	87252	Elinor	87	“ I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have you ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!—Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . ”
87278	87422	87274	87274	she	87	“ Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward ’s love , it is the greatest comfort I have . Poor Edward ! But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton ’s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister — besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;—and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me . They are such charming women!—I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . ”
87443	87552	87440	87440	Lucy	137	“ I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way — you know what I mean — if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she does dislike , I know it is most violent . ”
88170	88174	88175	88175	she	88	“ Dear Edward ! ”
88178	88194	88175	88175	she	88	“ this is a moment of great happiness!—This would almost make amends for every thing ! ”
88300	88309	88310	88310	she	88	“ Oh , do n’t think of me ! ”
88327	88350	88310	88310	she	88	“ do n’t think of my health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . ”
88384	88390	88392	88392	Edward	92	“ Do you like London ? ”
88405	88449	88450	88450	She	88	“ Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! ”
88457	88463	88464	88464	she	88	“ I think , Elinor , ”
88468	88514	88464	88464	she	88	“ we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . ”
88563	88601	88608	88608	she	88	“ We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull!—But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . ”
88640	88654	88608	88608	she	88	“ But why were you not there , Edward?—Why did you not come ? ”
88655	88661	88613	88613	her	88	“ I was engaged elsewhere . ”
88662	88678	88608	88608	she	88	“ Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? ”
88679	88685	88687	88687	Lucy	137	“ Perhaps , Miss Marianne , ”
88697	88722	88687	88687	Lucy	137	“ you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . ”
88742	88877	88738	88738	she	88	“ Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . ”
88926	88931	88933	88933	Marianne	88	“ Going so soon ! ”
88935	88945	88933	88933	Marianne	88	“ my dear Edward , this must not be . ”
88997	89006	89008	89008	Marianne	88	“ What can bring her here so often ? ”
89015	89029	89008	89008	Marianne	88	“ Could not she see that we wanted her gone!—how teazing to Edward ! ”
89030	89066	89067	89067	Marianne	88	“ Why so?—we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . ”
89076	89148	89067	89067	Marianne	88	“ You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . ”
90699	90720	90690	90690	she	88	“ her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . ”
91251	91256	91257	91257	he	143	“ Upon my soul , ”
91260	91402	91257	91257	he	143	“ I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ‘ My dear Madam , ’ I always say to her , ‘ you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt ’s , all this would have been prevented . ’ This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . ”
91444	91451	91452	91452	his	1926	“ You reside in Devonshire , I think,”—was
91456	91463	91464	91464	Elinor	87	“ in a cottage near Dawlish . ”
91504	91510	91512	91512	he	1926	“ For my own part , ”
91514	91687	91512	91512	he	1926	“ I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . And I protest , if I had any money to spare , I should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of London , where I might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi ’s . I was to decide on the best of them . ‘ My dear Courtland , ’ said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ‘ do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage . ’ And that I fancy , will be the end of it . “
91924	92080	92081	92081	I	0	” Elinor agreed to it all , for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition . As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister , his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else ; and a thought struck him during the evening , which he communicated to his wife , for her approbation , when they got home . The consideration of Mrs. Dennison ’s mistake , in supposing his sisters their guests , had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such , while Mrs. Jennings ’s engagements kept her from home . The expense would be nothing , the inconvenience not more ; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father . Fanny was startled at the proposal . “
92091	92095	92081	92081	I	0	” said she , “
92160	92178	92153	92153	I	0	” Her husband , but with great humility , did not see the force of her objection . “
92212	92227	92193	92194	Lady Middleton	99	” Fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said , “
92358	92983	92984	92984	Lord	1964	” Mr. Dashwood was convinced . He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately , and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year ; at the same time , however , slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless , by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon ’s wife , and Marianne as their visitor . Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister ’s , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them . This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy . Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her , herself ; cherishing all her hopes , and promoting all her views ! Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was , above all things , the most material to her interest , and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings ! It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged , nor too speedily made use of ; and the visit to Lady Middleton , which had not before had any precise limits , was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days ’ time . When the note was shown to Elinor , as it was within ten minutes after its arrival , it gave her , for the first time , some share in the expectations of Lucy ; for such a mark of uncommon kindness , vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance , seemed to declare that the good - will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself ; and might be brought , by time and address , to do every thing that Lucy wished . Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton , and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood ; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater . The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street , and all that reached Elinor of their influence there , strengthened her expectation of the event . Sir John , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking . Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them . END OF THE SECOND VOLUME CHAPTER XXXVII . Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , “
92997	92998	92992	92992	you	106	” “
93007	93008	93001	93001	ma’am	2963	” “
93295	93296	93287	93288	Mrs. Dashwood	86	” “
93303	93304	93309	93309	I	0	” “
94267	95022	95035	95035	he	2027	” Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it . She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy . What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself . For him she felt much compassion;—for Lucy very little — and it cost her some pains to procure that little;—for the rest of the party none at all . As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion . No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor ’s office was a painful one.—She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister ’s chief consolation,—to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to her fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it . She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward ’s engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief . That belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively . Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she had loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself ! As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.—Marianne ’s feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment . The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , — “
95040	95041	95035	95035	he	2027	” “
95069	95096	95060	95060	she	137	” At these words , Marianne ’s eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter . After a pause of wonder , she exclaimed — “
95106	95111	95099	95099	you	2026	” Elinor confirmed it . “
95138	95139	95130	95130	I	0	” “
95156	95157	95153	95154	the reverse	2028	” “
95161	95166	95153	95154	the reverse	2028	” cried Marianne again . “
95179	95180	95175	95175	you	2026	” “
95247	95253	95254	95254	I	0	” Marianne seemed much struck . “
95266	95270	95254	95254	I	0	” added Elinor ; “
95291	95292	95284	95284	I	0	” “
95302	95303	95298	95298	you	2032	” “
95567	95568	95572	95572	your	88	” “
95577	95581	95572	95572	your	88	” said Marianne , “
95627	95628	95629	95629	I	0	” “
96004	96010	96013	96013	Elinor	87	” Marianne was quite subdued . “
96015	96019	96020	96020	you	87	” she cried , “
96088	96246	96079	96079	I	0	” The tenderest caresses followed this confession . In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ; to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ; and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality . These were great concessions ; but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.—She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three times to say , “
96251	96341	96079	96079	I	0	”—She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward ’s affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.—Such advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself . The next morning brought a farther trial of it , in a visit from their brother , who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair , and bring them news of his wife . “
96349	96363	96346	96346	I	0	” said he with great solemnity , as soon as he was seated , “
96377	96393	96394	96394	Your	2053	” They all looked their assent ; it seemed too awful a moment for speech . “
96397	96401	96394	96394	Your	2053	” he continued , “
96651	96667	96635	96635	her	0	” Here he stopped to be thanked ; which being done , he went on . “
97012	97030	96998	96998	she	267	” Here Marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , “
97039	97040	96998	96998	she	267	” “
97048	97053	97043	97043	you	267	” replied her brother , “
97071	97087	97065	97065	Your	88	” Marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore . “
97093	97097	97110	97110	he	2053	” he continued , “
97144	97145	97132	97132	He	2053	” “
97148	97163	97132	97132	He	2053	” cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , “
97240	97280	97281	97281	I	0	” John Dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune . He therefore replied , without any resentment , “
97448	97483	97434	97434	his	2079	” Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and Elinor ’s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward , while braving his mother ’s threats , for a woman who could not reward him . “
97488	97493	97434	97434	his	2079	” said Mrs. Jennings , “
97500	97501	97502	97502	I	0	” “
97559	97560	97551	97551	we	2091	” “
97571	97572	97561	97563	Poor young man!—and	2092	” “
97696	97697	97698	97700	Poor young man	2095	” “
97702	97707	97698	97700	Poor young man	2095	” cried Mrs. Jennings , “
97757	97781	97729	97729	him	2079	” Elinor ’s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it . “
97793	97798	97791	97791	himself	2079	” said John Dashwood , “
97907	97908	97893	97893	I	0	” “
97911	97916	97919	97919	her	267	” said Mrs. Jennings , “
97951	97961	97935	97935	mine	0	” Marianne got up and walked about the room . “
97974	97978	97971	97972	a man	503	” continued John , “
98006	98746	98000	98000	I	0	” A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion , concluded his visit ; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny ’s indisposition , and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it , he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars ’s conduct , the Dashwoods ’ , and Edward ’s . Marianne ’s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party . CHAPTER XXXVIII . Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward ’s conduct , but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit . They only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient , and how small was the consolation , beyond the consciousness of doing right , that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune . Elinor gloried in his integrity ; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment . But though confidence between them was , by this public discovery , restored to its proper state , it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone . Elinor avoided it upon principle , as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts , by the too warm , too positive assurances of Marianne , that belief of Edward ’s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away ; and Marianne ’s courage soon failed her , in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever , by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor ’s conduct and her own . She felt all the force of that comparison ; but not as her sister had hoped , to urge her to exertion now ; she felt it with all the pain of continual self - reproach , regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before ; but it brought only the torture of penitence , without the hope of amendment . Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more . Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett ’s Buildings . But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time . The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens , though it was only the second week in March . Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number ; but Marianne , who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place . An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all Mrs. Jennings ’s conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection . She saw nothing of the Willoughbys , nothing of Edward , and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay , be interesting to her . But at last she found herself with some surprise , accosted by Miss Steele , who , though looking rather shy , expressed great satisfaction in meeting them , and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings , left her own party for a short time , to join their ’s . Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor , “
98776	98811	98773	98774	Mrs. Clarke	197	” It was lucky , however , for Mrs. Jennings ’s curiosity and Elinor ’s too , that she would tell any thing without being asked ; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt . “
98820	98830	98773	98774	Mrs. Clarke	197	” said Miss Steele , taking her familiarly by the arm—“for
98843	98850	98835	98835	you	2737	” And then lowering her voice , “
98865	98866	98862	98862	she	102	” “
98877	98878	98875	98875	you	0	” “
98893	98894	98902	98902	she	99	” “
98906	98907	98902	98902	she	99	” “
99092	99124	99078	99078	I	0	” She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first . “
99131	99135	99136	99136	people	2759	” speaking triumphantly , “
99206	99207	99187	99187	herself	137	” “
99224	99228	99220	99220	I	0	” said Elinor . “
99998	99999	100000	100000	I	0	” “
100011	100015	100005	100005	you	0	” said Elinor ; “
100029	100030	100027	100027	you	0	” “
100098	100099	100088	100088	I	0	” “
100102	100106	100108	100108	you	0	” cried Elinor ; “
100168	100169	100160	100160	you	0	” “
100251	100281	100282	100282	Edward	97	” Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind . “
100290	100294	100282	100282	Edward	97	” said she ; “
100564	100565	100555	100555	I	0	” “
100568	100572	100555	100555	I	0	” said Elinor , “
100591	100615	100584	100584	You	3318	” Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary . “
100805	101040	100796	100796	you	3318	” Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind . Edward ’s marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be;—every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance . As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark . “
101177	101200	101201	101201	Bartlett	173	” The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself . It was as follows : “
101207	101646	101201	101201	Bartlett	173	“ I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another ’s love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother ’s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.—Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n’t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ’ twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.—My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , “
101652	101696	101701	101701	she	2185	” As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer ’s real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise . “
101829	102121	101821	101821	Lucy	137	” CHAPTER XXXIX . The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne ’s impatience to be gone increased every day . She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it . Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs. Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them . This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;—but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . “
102122	102129	102187	102187	Elinor	87	Cleveland!”—she cried , with great agitation . “
102139	102140	102141	102141	You	0	” “
102144	102149	102141	102141	You	0	” said Elinor gently , “
102165	102166	102141	102141	You	0	” “
102198	102454	102187	102187	Elinor	87	” Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;—she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;—represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day ’s journey ; and their mother ’s servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ’ time . As Marianne ’s affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started . Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland . Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother ’s concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;—and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . “
102472	102491	102492	102492	they	2191	Dashwoods;”—was Mrs. Jennings ’s address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled—“for
102527	102863	102864	102864	I	0	” Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it ; and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor ’s moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might not hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment . Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne ’s turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel ’s inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . This set the matter beyond a doubt . She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think that any material objection ; and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne ’s performance brought her these words in the Colonel ’s calm voice , — “
102875	102895	102896	102896	Lord	2194	” Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , “
102901	102913	102896	102896	Lord	2194	it?”—but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . “
102926	102987	102988	102988	I	0	” This delay on the Colonel ’s side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which showed her to feel what she said , “
102999	103076	103077	103077	I	0	” Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply ! She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . “
103081	103089	103077	103077	I	0	” said he , with great compassion , “
103142	103150	103132	103132	I	0	” Elinor told him that it was . “
103158	103166	103193	103193	she	97	” he replied , with great feeling , “
103431	103817	103427	103427	him	143	” Elinor ’s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand . The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry ; and she , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it ! Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause ; but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed . She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward ’s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself . It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from her , she would have been very glad to be spared herself ; but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition . Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele . She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day . After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and then it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent ; an evil which Elinor , as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size . “
103824	103828	103427	103427	him	143	” said she , “
103850	103909	103910	103912	This little rectory	2210	” By which the Colonel was surprised to find that she was considering Mr. Ferrars ’s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on , and he said so . “
104063	104143	104146	104147	Miss Dashwood	106	” Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage . CHAPTER XL . “
104149	104165	104146	104147	Miss Dashwood	106	” said Mrs. Jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , “
104231	104232	104220	104220	I	0	” “
104238	104242	104234	104234	you	106	” said Elinor . “
104295	104296	104286	104286	I	0	” “
104334	104335	104336	104336	You	2737	” “
104364	104365	104351	104351	you	2737	” “
104368	104371	104351	104351	you	2737	” repeated Mrs. Jennings—“Oh
104440	104441	104442	104442	You	2737	” “
104453	104462	104450	104450	I	0	” said Elinor , with a faint smile . “
104507	104508	104509	104509	He	667	” “
104518	104519	104509	104509	He	667	” “
104540	104570	104538	104538	himself	667	” They were interrupted by the servant ’s coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to go , said , — “
104651	104662	104640	104640	you	2737	” Marianne had left the room before the conversation began . “
104687	104688	104675	104675	I	0	” “
104694	104701	104675	104675	I	0	” said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed . “
104726	104727	104714	104714	I	0	” “
104804	104855	104860	104860	you	2963	” This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly . Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend . A few moments ’ reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ; — “
104932	104963	104926	104926	he	667	” Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings ’s speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion . “
104988	104989	104973	104973	he	103	” “
105055	105068	105069	105069	I	0	” And away she went ; but returning again in a moment , “
105140	105141	105130	105130	you	2737	” “
105146	105507	105508	105509	Mrs. Jennings	102	” replied Elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject . How she should begin — how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern . The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her hand , till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself . He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business . Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance . She had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes . He too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.—Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair . “
105513	105517	105508	105509	Mrs. Jennings	102	” said he , “
105601	105602	105603	105603	You	102	” “
105611	105633	105660	105660	she	102	” said Elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , “
105825	105881	105882	105883	Colonel Brandon	103	” What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . He looked all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , — “
105885	105886	105882	105883	Colonel Brandon	103	” “
105889	105905	105882	105883	Colonel Brandon	103	” continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , “
105982	105983	105984	105985	Colonel Brandon	103	” “
105994	105995	105984	105985	Colonel Brandon	103	” “
106012	106013	105984	105985	Colonel Brandon	103	” “
106016	106024	105984	105985	Colonel Brandon	103	” replied he , with sudden consciousness , “
106073	106074	106075	106075	You	102	” “
106195	106278	106279	106280	Colonel Brandon	103	” Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it . For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;—at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , “
106324	106325	106309	106309	He	103	” “
106328	106332	106309	106309	He	103	” replied Elinor , “
106390	106441	106442	106443	Colonel Brandon	103	” Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . “
106454	106475	106442	106443	Colonel Brandon	103	” said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair . Elinor told him the number of the house . “
106513	106573	106501	106501	he	103	” Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on his , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it . “
106580	106593	106501	106501	he	103	” said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , “
106603	106708	106598	106601	the husband of Lucy	2266	” And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent . When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared . “
106714	106718	106598	106601	the husband of Lucy	2266	” she cried , “
106752	106753	106740	106740	You	2737	” “
106764	106765	106756	106756	ma’am	2963	” “
106783	106784	106756	106756	ma’am	2963	” “
106787	106791	106756	106756	ma’am	2963	” said Elinor , “
106830	106831	106819	106819	I	0	” “
106837	106842	106843	106843	Lord	3466	” cried Mrs. Jennings ; “
106929	106930	106931	106931	My	0	” “
106935	106939	106931	106931	My	0	” said Elinor , “
106963	106964	106960	106961	Mr. Ferrars	143	” “
106997	107054	106973	106973	you	2737	” The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first . “
107067	107082	106973	106973	you	2737	” said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , “
107185	107186	107180	107180	Lucy	137	” “
107209	107210	107188	107189	Colonel Brandon	103	” “
107278	107864	107274	107274	Lucy	137	” Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . CHAPTER XLI . Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett ’s Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas . So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward would give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood ’s part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and secretly resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry . It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife ’s indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.—This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions . Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister ’s going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor ’s service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward ’s part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tête - à - tête with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out . He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in . They walked up stairs in to the drawing - room.—Nobody was there . “
107875	107879	107868	107868	her	91	” said he : “
107936	107946	107947	107947	I	0	” Elinor made what excuse she could for her . “
107956	107960	107947	107947	I	0	” he replied , “
108007	108008	107982	107982	he	215	” “
108023	108024	108013	108013	Brandon	103	” “
108048	108049	108025	108025	Really!—Well	217	” “
108056	108057	108025	108025	Really!—Well	217	” “
108234	108285	108299	108300	the Colonel	667	” Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority . “
108289	108296	108299	108300	the Colonel	667	astonishing!”—he cried , after hearing what she said—“what
108304	108305	108299	108300	the Colonel	667	” “
108319	108320	108316	108317	Mr. Ferrars	143	” “
108372	108413	108414	108415	Mrs. Ferrars	97	” Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished . “
108417	108433	108414	108415	Mrs. Ferrars	97	” added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , “
108476	108477	108469	108469	she	91	” “
108629	108630	108633	108633	Elinor	87	” “
108635	108639	108633	108633	Elinor	87	” said John , “
108714	108715	108716	108716	You	87	” “
108734	108735	108736	108736	You	87	” “
108754	108759	108741	108742	Mrs. Ferrars	97	” Elinor was silent . “
108762	108771	108741	108742	Mrs. Ferrars	97	now,”—said Mr. Dashwood , after a short pause , “
108779	108799	108800	108801	The lady	375	” Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother ’s tone , calmly replied , — “
108813	108814	108800	108801	The lady	375	” “
108820	108821	108817	108817	you	87	” “
108850	108851	108826	108826	I	0	” “
108901	108920	108889	108889	I	0	” Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.—His reflections ended thus . “
108929	108942	108889	108889	I	0	” kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper , “
109221	109614	109214	109215	Colonel Brandon	103	” Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;—and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars . After a few moments ’ chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister ’s being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother ’s love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother ’s integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart . They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject . Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on him . He laughed most immoderately . The idea of Edward ’s being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;—and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of hers , but by his own sensibility . “
109623	109647	109214	109215	Colonel Brandon	103	” said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment ; “
109964	109965	109957	109959	My poor mother	2342	” “
109973	109974	109970	109971	the lady	375	” “
110239	112697	110224	110224	He	146	” He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject . But though she never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself . She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;—an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful . CHAPTER XLII . One other short call in Harley Street , in which Elinor received her brother ’s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense , and on Colonel Brandon ’s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two , completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town;—and a faint invitation from Fanny , to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way , which of all things was the most unlikely to occur , with a more warm , though less public , assurance , from John to Elinor , of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford , was all that foretold any meeting in the country . It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford;—a place , in which , of all others , she would now least chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings , but even Lucy , when they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there . Very early in April , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes , to meet , by appointment , on the road . For the convenience of Charlotte and her child , they were to be more than two days on their journey , and Mr. Palmer , travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon , was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival . Marianne , few as had been her hours of comfort in London , and eager as she had long been to quit it , could not , when it came to the point , bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes , and that confidence , in Willoughby , which were now extinguished for ever , without great pain . Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained , busy in new engagements , and new schemes , in which she could have no share , without shedding many tears . Elinor ’s satisfaction , at the moment of removal , was more positive . She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on , she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment ’s regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy ’s friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne ’s peace of mind , and confirming her own . Their journey was safely performed . The second day brought them into the cherished , or the prohibited , county of Somerset , for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne ’s imagination ; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland . Cleveland was a spacious , modern - built house , situated on a sloping lawn . It had no park , but the pleasure - grounds were tolerably extensive ; and like every other place of the same degree of importance , it had its open shrubbery , and closer wood walk , a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation , led to the front , the lawn was dotted over with timber , the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir , the mountain - ash , and the acacia , and a thick screen of them altogether , interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars , shut out the offices . Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton , and not thirty from Combe Magna ; and before she had been five minutes within its walls , while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper , she quitted it again , stealing away through the winding shrubberies , now just beginning to be in beauty , to gain a distant eminence ; where , from its Grecian temple , her eye , wandering over a wide tract of country to the south - east , could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon , and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen . In such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles . She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house , on an excursion through its more immediate premises ; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away , in lounging round the kitchen garden , examining the bloom upon its walls , and listening to the gardener ’s lamentations upon blights , in dawdling through the green - house , where the loss of her favourite plants , unwarily exposed , and nipped by the lingering frost , raised the laughter of Charlotte,—and in visiting her poultry - yard , where , in the disappointed hopes of her dairy - maid , by hens forsaking their nests , or being stolen by a fox , or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood , she found fresh sources of merriment . The morning was fine and dry , and Marianne , in her plan of employment abroad , had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland . With great surprise therefore , did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner . She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even she could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking . Their party was small , and the hours passed quietly away . Mrs. Palmer had her child , and Mrs. Jennings her carpet - work ; they talked of the friends they had left behind , arranged Lady Middleton ’s engagements , and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther than Reading that night . Elinor , however little concerned in it , joined in their discourse ; and Marianne , who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library , however it might be avoided by the family in general , soon procured herself a book . Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer ’s side that constant and friendly good humour could do , to make them feel themselves welcome . The openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness ; her kindness , recommended by so pretty a face , was engaging ; her folly , though evident was not disgusting , because it was not conceited ; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh . The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner , affording a pleasant enlargement of the party , and a very welcome variety to their conversation , which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low . Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer , and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself , that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family . She found him , however , perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors , and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother ; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion , and only prevented from being so always , by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general , as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte . For the rest of his character and habits , they were marked , as far as Elinor could perceive , with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life . He was nice in his eating , uncertain in his hours ; fond of his child , though affecting to slight it ; and idled away the mornings at billiards , which ought to have been devoted to business . She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;—not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward ’s generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings . Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars , and the kind confidante of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.—His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs. Jennings ’s persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself . But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs. Jennings ’s suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two;—she watched his eyes , while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;—and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne ’s feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady ’s observation;—she could discover in them the quick feelings , and needless alarm of a lover . Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had — assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings — given Marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself . Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined . Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night ’s rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies . CHAPTER XLIII . Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments . But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister ’s composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne ’s inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings ’s advice , of sending for the Palmers ’ apothecary . He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word “
112699	113987	113989	113989	mama	2815	” to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby ’s account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne ’s complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris ’s report , and confirming Charlotte ’s fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood . Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris ’s arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer ’s , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she then really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.—Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister ’s account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c. she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs. Jennings ’s entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence . Marianne was , of course , kept in ignorance of all these arrangements . She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival . It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer ; and as it gave her likewise no concern , she never mentioned her name . Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer ’s departure , and her situation continued , with little variation , the same . Mr. Harris , who attended her every day , still talked boldly of a speedy recovery , and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine ; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful . Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it , and Colonel Brandon , who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings ’s forebodings , was not in a state of mind to resist their influence . He tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more . On the morning of the third day however , the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away ; for when Mr. Harris arrived , he declared his patient materially better . Her pulse was much stronger , and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit . Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend ’s , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel . But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began . Towards the evening Marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before . Her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected the most beneficial effects . Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . Mrs. Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper ’s room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne . The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out , — “
113992	113993	113989	113989	mama	2815	” “
113997	114014	113989	113989	mama	2815	” cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , “
114043	114044	114035	114035	you	2352	” “
114054	114064	114046	114046	she	2815	” cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner . “
114077	116436	116437	116438	Miss Dashwood	106	” Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse . It was lower and quicker than ever ! and Marianne , still talking wildly of mama , her alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr. Harris , and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother . To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing - room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present . It was no time for hesitation . Her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him . Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of:—he listened to them in silent despondence;—but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood . Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome . She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris , and an order for post - horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother . The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon — or such a companion for her mother,—how gratefully was it felt!—a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her!—as far as the shock of such a summons could be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it . He , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return . Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind . The horses arrived , even before they were expected , and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity , and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear , hurried into the carriage . It was then about twelve o’clock , and she returned to her sister ’s apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night . It was a night of almost equal suffering to both . Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne ’s side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor ’s , before Mr. Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought . Marianne ’s ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational . She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris , or if he could not come , for some other advice , when the former — but not till after five o’clock — arrived . His opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to Elinor . He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them . With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister ’s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope . Her heart was really grieved . The rapid decay , the early death of a girl so young , so lovely as Marianne , must have struck a less interested person with concern . On Mrs. Jennings ’s compassion she had other claims . She had been for three months her companion , was still under her care , and she was known to have been greatly injured , and long unhappy . The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her;—and as for their mother , when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to her what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in her sufferings was very sincere . Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;—but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce . His medicines had failed;—the fever was unabated ; and Marianne only more quiet — not more herself — remained in a heavy stupor . Elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice . But he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood . She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister ’s bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne ’s disappointment had brought on . Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea , and it gave fresh misery to her reflections . About noon , however , she began — but with a caution — a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend — to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister ’s pulse;—she waited , watched , and examined it again and again;—and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes . Mrs. Jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;—and Elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope . But it was too late . Hope had already entered ; and feeling all its anxious flutter , she bent over her sister to watch — she hardly knew for what . Half an hour passed away , and the favourable symptom yet blessed her . Others even arose to confirm it . Her breath , her skin , her lips , all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment ; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational , though languid , gaze . Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees , and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o’clock;—when his assurances , his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation , gave her confidence , comfort , and tears of joy . Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety . Marianne restored to life , health , friends , and to her doting mother , was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort , and expand it in fervent gratitude;—but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy , no words , no smiles . All within Elinor ’s breast was satisfaction , silent and strong . She continued by the side of her sister , with little intermission the whole afternoon , calming every fear , satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits , supplying every succour , and watching almost every look and every breath . The possibility of a relapse would of course , in some moments , occur to remind her of what anxiety was — but when she saw , on her frequent and minute examination , that every symptom of recovery continued , and saw Marianne at six o’clock sink into a quiet , steady , and to all appearance comfortable , sleep , she silenced every doubt . The time was now drawing on , when Colonel Brandon might be expected back . At ten o’clock , she trusted , or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them . The Colonel , too!—perhaps scarcely less an object of pity!—Oh!—how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance ! At seven o’clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing - room to tea . Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears , and of dinner by their sudden reverse , from eating much;—and the present refreshment , therefore , with such feelings of content as she brought to it , was particularly welcome . Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother ’s arrival , and allow her to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant . Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep . The night was cold and stormy . The wind roared round the house , and the rain beat against the windows ; but Elinor , all happiness within , regarded it not . Marianne slept through every blast ; and the travellers — they had a rich reward in store , for every present inconvenience . The clock struck eight . Had it been ten , Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house ; and so strong was the persuasion that she did , in spite of the almost impossibility of their being already come , that she moved into the adjoining dressing - closet and opened a window shutter , to be satisfied of the truth . She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her . The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view . By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses ; and this , while it told the excess of her poor mother ’s alarm , gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity . Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm , as at that moment . The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door — of her doubt — her dread — perhaps her despair!—and of what she had to tell!—with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm . All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings ’s maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs . The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room,—she entered it,—and saw only Willoughby . CHAPTER XLIV . Elinor , starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him , obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room , and her hand was already on the lock , when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing , and saying , in a voice rather of command than supplication , “
116455	116456	116449	116449	I	0	” “
116461	116467	116459	116459	sir	2086	” she replied with firmness , “
116500	116501	116481	116482	The servants	541	” “
116507	116513	116503	116503	they	541	” he cried with vehemence , “
116546	116547	116544	116544	you	0	” “
116549	116552	116544	116544	you	0	me!”—in the utmost amazement—“well
116565	116566	116554	116554	sir,—be	2357	” “
116576	116675	116571	116571	I	0	” She hesitated ; she knew not what to do . The possibility of Colonel Brandon ’s arriving and finding her there , came across her . But she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged . After a moment ’s recollection , therefore , concluding that prudence required dispatch , and that her acquiescence would best promote it , she walked silently towards the table , and sat down . He took the opposite chair , and for half a minute not a word was said by either . “
116680	116683	116571	116571	I	0	sir,”—said Elinor , impatiently;—“I
116690	116708	116709	116710	Your sister	2804	” He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation , and seemed not to hear her . “
116712	116721	116709	116710	Your sister	2804	” said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards—“is
116745	116760	116762	116762	God	152	” Elinor would not speak . He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness . “
116779	116780	116783	116783	she	2804	” “
116786	116797	116783	116783	she	2804	” He rose up , and walked across the room . “
116812	116823	116783	116783	she	2804	” speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat,—“what
116861	116869	116871	116871	you	2362	” a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks , “
116881	116928	116871	116871	you	2362	” Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever . She began to think that he must be in liquor;—the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying , “
116972	116973	116974	116974	I	0	” “
116978	116993	116976	116976	you	0	” he replied , with an expressive smile , and a voice perfectly calm ; “
117019	117020	116976	116976	you	0	” “
117022	117039	116976	116976	you	0	Marlborough!”—cried Elinor , more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at . “
117071	117119	117120	117121	Mr. Willoughby	105	” The steadiness of his manner , and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke , convincing Elinor , that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland , he was not brought there by intoxication , she said , after a moment ’s recollection , “
117169	117170	117164	117164	you	105	” “
117174	117182	117164	117164	you	105	” said he , with serious energy , “
117260	117261	117254	117254	Ma	225	” “
117271	117272	117268	117268	your	105	” “
117277	117305	117268	117268	your	105	is,”—was his answer , with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance , and in spite of herself made her think him sincere . “
117327	117328	117330	117330	she	88	” “
117332	117342	117330	117330	she	88	” he cried , in the same eager tone . “
117376	117382	117371	117371	you	2366	” Elinor bowed her assent . “
117388	117407	117371	117371	you	2366	” said he , after a pause of expectation on her side , and thoughtfulness on his own , “
117622	117647	117654	117655	Mr. Willoughby	105	” Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , “
117698	117699	117700	117700	I	0	” “
117710	117714	117700	117700	I	0	” he replied , “
118010	118011	118012	118012	You	0	” “
118016	118024	118012	118012	You	0	” said Elinor , a little softened , “
118034	118035	118026	118026	yourself	0	” “
118326	118333	118346	118348	some distant relation	2383	place,”—here he hesitated and looked down . “
118376	118390	118394	118394	you	2804	” he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,—“your
118404	118405	118406	118406	I	0	” “
118409	118427	118406	118406	I	0	” returned Elinor , colouring likewise , and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him , “
118457	118458	118450	118450	I	0	” “
118461	118465	118450	118450	I	0	” cried Willoughby , “
118658	118659	118660	118660	Your	0	” “
118759	118760	118751	118751	she	2386	” “
118773	118778	118767	118767	I	0	” he warmly replied ; “
118806	118807	118799	118799	her	2386	” “
118818	118819	118820	118820	She	2386	” “
119240	119241	119244	119244	you	0	” “
119250	119256	119244	119244	you	0	” said Elinor , reproachfully ; “
119272	119273	119244	119244	you	0	” “
119514	119528	119530	119530	you	0	” They were both silent for a few moments . Elinor first spoke . “
119539	119540	119530	119530	you	0	” “
119550	119556	119546	119546	I	0	” he replied , impatiently ; “
119755	119759	119762	119762	sir	2086	” He stopped . “
119764	119780	119762	119762	sir	2086	” said Elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , “
119786	119787	119762	119762	sir	2086	” “
119806	119807	119801	119801	she	2407	” “
119817	119818	119823	119823	hers	2407	” “
119954	119992	119947	119947	I	0	” Elinor ’s heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again;—yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . “
120019	120020	120021	120021	Marianne	88	” “
120318	120319	120315	120315	my	0	” “
120327	120328	120315	120315	my	0	” “
120885	120903	120865	120865	She	88	” A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded . Willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : “
120925	120926	120927	120927	We	2437	” “
120933	120934	120935	120937	Your poor mother	2438	” “
120943	120944	120935	120937	Your poor mother	2438	” “
120965	120966	120957	120957	you	105	” “
121188	121189	121190	121190	Your	0	” “
121201	121202	121190	121190	Your	0	” “
121519	121520	121521	121521	You	2453	” “
121532	121550	121526	121527	Mr. Willoughby	105	” said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; “
121642	121643	121632	121632	I	0	” “
121653	121661	121669	121669	She	2455	” said he with a heavy sigh ; “
121760	121761	121751	121751	I	0	” “
121824	121825	121827	121827	you	2453	” “
121944	121945	121946	121946	I	0	” “
121987	121988	121965	121965	you	2453	” “
122302	122561	122298	122298	you	2462	” Elinor made no answer . Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper . The world had made him extravagant and vain — Extravagance and vanity had made him cold - hearted and selfish . Vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed . Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil , had led him likewise to punishment . The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said — “
122575	122576	122570	122570	I	0	” “
122584	122585	122578	122578	you	0	” “
122610	122630	122632	122632	you	2471	” He held out his hand . She could not refuse to give him hers;—he pressed it with affection . “
122643	122710	122632	122632	you	2471	” said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go . Elinor assured him that she did;—that she forgave , pitied , wished him well — was even interested in his happiness — and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it . His answer was not very encouraging . “
122715	122719	122632	122632	you	2471	” said he , “
122809	122817	122799	122799	I	0	” Elinor stopped him with a reproof . “
122818	122819	122841	122841	you	0	Well,”—he replied—“once
122837	122838	122841	122841	you	0	” “
122844	122845	122841	122841	you	0	” “
122851	122852	122841	122841	you	0	” “
122871	122872	122858	122858	She	2804	” “
122936	123693	123695	123695	Willoughby	105	” And with these words , he almost ran out of the room . CHAPTER XLV . Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister . Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself — to his wishes than to his merits . She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less . When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . Elinor ’s heart was full . The past , the present , the future , Willoughby ’s visit , Marianne ’s safety , and her mother ’s expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby ’s leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.—Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment ’s horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it . Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne ’s being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but she , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief ; and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend ; and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon ’s hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . Elinor ’s delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep : but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood would sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , in compliance with her mother ’s entreaty , went to bed . But the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of spirits . Willoughby , “
123697	124092	123695	123695	Willoughby	105	” as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival ’s , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby ’s death . The shock of Colonel Brandon ’s errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood ’s looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward . But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;—and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor . It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred . “
124123	124145	124116	124116	He	103	” Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . “
124211	124275	124276	124276	He	103	” Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;—but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . “
124397	124436	124437	124437	His	103	” Here , however , Elinor perceived,—not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother ’s active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose . “
124518	124519	124520	124521	Colonel Brandon	103	” “
124525	124529	124531	124533	an excellent man	3290	” said Elinor , “
124539	124540	124541	124541	I	0	” “
124544	124549	124520	124521	Colonel Brandon	103	is,”—replied her mother seriously , “
124603	124604	124605	124605	His	103	” “
124610	124614	124605	124605	His	103	” answered Elinor , “
124733	124734	124724	124724	you	0	” “
124897	124898	124889	124889	His	103	” “
124918	124919	124909	124909	you	0	” “
125094	125113	125115	125115	his	103	” Elinor could not remember it ; but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , “
125233	125257	125230	125231	Colonel Brandon	103	” She paused.—Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . “
125271	125276	125261	125261	she	88	” added Mrs. Dashwood , “
125319	125336	125337	125337	His	103	” Poor Elinor!—here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!—but her spirit was stubborn . “
125376	126574	125366	125366	I	0	” Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby . CHAPTER XLVI . Marianne ’s illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother ’s presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into Mrs. Palmer ’s dressing - room . When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her . His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor ’s conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs. Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel ’s behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . At the end of another day or two , Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours , Mrs. Dashwood , urged equally by her own and her daughter ’s wishes , began to talk of removing to Barton . On her measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs. Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ’ stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable . At his and Mrs. Jennings ’s united request in return , Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back , for the better accommodation of her sick child ; and the Colonel , at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings , whose active good - nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself , engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage , in the course of a few weeks . The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford . The Dashwoods were two days on the road , and Marianne bore her journey on both , without essential fatigue . Every thing that the most zealous affection , the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable , was the office of each watchful companion , and each found their reward in her bodily ease , and her calmness of spirits . To Elinor , the observation of the latter was particularly grateful . She , who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering , oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of , nor fortitude to conceal , now saw with a joy , which no other could equally share , an apparent composure of mind , which , in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection , must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness . As they approached Barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window . But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise . In the whole of her subsequent manner , she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion ; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting - room , than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness , as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.—She said little , but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness , and though a sigh sometimes escaped her , it never passed away without the atonement of a smile . After dinner she would try her piano - forte . She went to it ; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera , procured for her by Willoughby , containing some of their favourite duets , and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand - writing.—That would not do.—She shook her head , put the music aside , and after running over the keys for a minute , complained of feebleness in her fingers , and closed the instrument again ; declaring however with firmness as she did so , that she should in future practice much . The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms . On the contrary , with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest , she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit , anticipating the pleasure of Margaret ’s return , and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored , of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society , as the only happiness worth a wish . “
126588	126592	125366	125366	I	0	” said she , “
126814	127094	126807	126807	I	0	” Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self - control . Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity . Willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister ’s health were more secure , before she appointed it . But the resolution was made only to be broken . Marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out . But at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter ’s wishes and the mother ’s confidence ; and Marianne , leaning on Elinor ’s arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house . The sisters set out at a pace , slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required ; and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill , the important hill behind , when pausing with her eyes turned towards it , Marianne calmly said , — “
127098	127103	126807	126807	I	0	there,”—pointing with one hand , “
127118	127132	127116	127116	Willoughby	105	” Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added , “
127160	127166	127158	127158	Elinor	87	” hesitatingly it was said . “
127189	127198	127180	127180	I	0	” Elinor tenderly invited her to be open . “
127203	127207	127208	127208	I	0	” said Marianne , “
127309	127322	127305	127307	that unfortunate girl	2386	” She stopt . Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered , “
127338	127339	127331	127331	you	2520	” “
127405	127406	127433	127433	I	0	” “
127410	127415	127417	127417	you	2520	” asked her sister , “
127423	127424	127417	127417	you	2520	” “
127445	127484	127435	127435	him	105	” Elinor said no more . She was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly , or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;—and they crept on for a few minutes in silence . “
127494	127503	127485	127485	I	0	” said Marianne at last with a sigh , “
127526	127527	127529	127529	you	2520	” “
127536	127537	127529	127529	you	2520	” “
127557	127558	127551	127551	I	0	” “
127566	127567	127568	127568	They	2524	” “
128156	128207	128208	128208	You	2536	” Here ceased the rapid flow of her self - reproving spirit ; and Elinor , impatient to soothe , though too honest to flatter , gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved . Marianne pressed her hand and replied , — “
128408	128419	128425	128425	his	105	” She paused — and added in a low voice , “
128433	128699	128701	128701	mama	2815	” Elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact . She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard . Marianne said not a word.—She trembled , her eyes were fixed on the ground , and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them . A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one . She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister ’s , and tears covered her cheeks . Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged . As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , “
128703	129065	128701	128701	mama	2815	” withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs . Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction . CHAPTER XLVII . Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite . She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;—she was sorry for him;—she wished him happy . But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.—Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken — a character unblemished , to Marianne . Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means , nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza . Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon . Had Mrs. Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby ’s story from himself — had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater . But it was neither in Elinor ’s power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby ’s deserts;—she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray . In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;—but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting — her rising colour , as she spoke,—and her unsteady voice , plainly showed . “
129073	129077	129066	129066	I	0	” said she , “
129092	129133	129143	129143	Elinor	87	” Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not Elinor , who really wished to hear her sister ’s unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence . Marianne slowly continued , — “
129160	129180	129143	129143	Elinor	87	”—For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before—“I
129234	129235	129236	129236	I	0	” “
129244	129249	129240	129240	I	0	” cried her mother . “
129311	129318	129319	129319	I	0	” Marianne sighed , and repeated , “
129325	129326	129327	129327	You	0	” “
129332	129336	129327	129327	You	0	” said Elinor , “
129631	129642	129610	129610	your	0	” Marianne ’s lips quivered , and she repeated the word “
129645	129650	129651	129651	you	0	” in a tone that implied—“do
129657	129658	129651	129651	you	0	” “
129665	129669	129610	129610	your	0	” replied Elinor , “
129742	129743	129738	129738	his	318	” “
129756	129757	129753	129753	his	318	” “
129761	129765	129766	129766	he	318	” continued Elinor , “
129934	129935	129936	129936	I	0	” “
129944	129948	129936	129936	I	0	” said Marianne ; “
129962	129963	129966	129967	your mother	2768	” “
129974	129979	129966	129967	your mother	2768	” said Mrs. Dashwood ; “
129985	130030	129980	129980	she	2768	” Marianne would not let her proceed;—and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ’s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , “
130087	130316	130435	130435	I	0	” Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon ’s injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her . Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health . Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward . She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne ’s illness ; and in the first of John ’s , there had been this sentence:—“We
130344	130434	130435	130435	I	0	” which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters . She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures . Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication , — “
130448	130659	130437	130437	you	0	” Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics . Mrs. Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant ’s inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor ’s countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne ’s situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention . The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs. Dashwood ’s assistance , supported her into the other room . By that time , Marianne was rather better , and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it . “
130671	130672	130669	130669	Thomas	188	” “
130867	130868	130857	130857	they	633	” “
130880	130881	130871	130871	she	231	” “
130932	130933	130924	130924	I	0	” “
130943	130944	130935	130936	Mr. Ferrars	143	” “
130972	130995	130966	130967	a gentleman	988	” Elinor ’s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation . “
131005	131006	130998	131000	no one else	1108	” “
131015	131016	130998	131000	no one else	1108	” “
131025	131026	131018	131018	you	0	” “
131042	131043	131034	131035	Miss Lucy	137	” “
131051	131052	131046	131046	they	2585	” “
131080	131161	131072	131072	they	2585	” Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but Elinor knew better than to expect them . She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them . She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt ’s , near Plymouth . Thomas ’s intelligence seemed over . Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . “
131173	131174	131163	131163	you	2589	” “
131201	131202	131194	131194	I	0	” “
131209	131210	131204	131205	Mrs. Ferrars	97	” “
131242	131996	131237	131237	she	97	” Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more . Mrs. Dashwood ’s and Elinor ’s appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before . When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence . Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor ’s representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne . She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;—that Marianne ’s affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude . CHAPTER XLVIII . Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence . That he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first . But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self - provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay . They were married , married in town , and now hastening down to her uncle ’s . What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton , on seeing her mother ’s servant , on hearing Lucy ’s message ! They would soon , she supposed , be settled at Delaford.—Delaford,—that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest ; which she wished to be acquainted with , and yet desired to avoid . She saw them in an instant in their parsonage - house ; saw in Lucy , the active , contriving manager , uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality , and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;—pursuing her own interest in every thought , courting the favour of Colonel Brandon , of Mrs. Jennings , and of every wealthy friend . In Edward — she knew not what she saw , nor what she wished to see;—happy or unhappy,—nothing pleased her ; she turned away her head from every sketch of him . Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars,—but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings . Though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend . They were all thoughtless or indolent . “
132007	132025	131999	131999	you	2594	” was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on . “
132076	132201	132202	132202	He	2598	” This was gaining something , something to look forward to . Colonel Brandon must have some information to give . Scarcely had she so determined it , when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window . He stopt at their gate . It was a gentleman , it was Colonel Brandon himself . Now she could hear more ; and she trembled in expectation of it . But it was not Colonel Brandon ; neither his air , nor his height . Were it possible , she must say it must be Edward . She looked again . He had just dismounted : she could not be mistaken,—it was Edward . She moved away and sat down . “
132225	132659	132218	132218	I	0	” In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake . She saw her mother and Marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other . She would have given the world to be able to speak — and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness , no slight , would appear in their behaviour to him;—but she had no utterance , and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion . Not a syllable passed aloud . They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor . His footsteps were heard along the gravel path ; in a moment he was in the passage , and in another he was before them . His countenance , as he entered the room , was not too happy , even for Elinor . His complexion was white with agitation , and he looked as if fearful of his reception , and conscious that he merited no kind one . Mrs. Dashwood , however , conforming , as she trusted , to the wishes of that daughter , by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing , met him with a look of forced complacency , gave him her hand , and wished him joy . He coloured , and stammered out an unintelligible reply . Elinor ’s lips had moved with her mother ’s , and , when the moment of action was over , she wished that she had shaken hands with him too . But it was then too late , and with a countenance meaning to be open , she sat down again and talked of the weather . Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight , to conceal her distress ; and Margaret , understanding some part , but not the whole of the case , thought it incumbent on her to be dignified , and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could , and maintained a strict silence . When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season , a very awful pause took place . It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood , who felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well . In a hurried manner , he replied in the affirmative . Another pause . Elinor resolving to exert herself , though fearing the sound of her own voice , now said , “
132666	132667	132661	132662	Mrs. Ferrars	97	” “
132671	132681	132661	132662	Mrs. Ferrars	97	” he replied , with an air of surprise . “
132690	132691	132692	132692	I	0	” “
132695	132707	132692	132692	I	0	” said Elinor , taking up some work from the table , “
132715	132750	132752	132752	you	0	” She dared not look up;—but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him . He coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said , — “
132765	132766	132762	132763	Robert Ferrars	143	” “
132771	132863	132758	132758	you	0	” was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ; and though Elinor could not speak , even her eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder . He rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice , — “
132892	132930	132888	132890	Miss Lucy Steele	137	” His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor , who sat with her head leaning over her work , in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was . “
132933	132937	132888	132890	Miss Lucy Steele	137	” said he , “
132950	133524	132888	132890	Miss Lucy Steele	137	” Elinor could sit it no longer . She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease . Edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw — or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village — leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden;—a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures . CHAPTER XLIX . Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre - determined by all;—for after experiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother ’s consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of that , than the immediate contraction of another . His errand at Barton , in fact , was a simple one . It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;—and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air . How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told . This only need be said;—that when they all sat down to table at four o’clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother ’s consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men . His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits . He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;—and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire . He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness;—and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four . “
133536	133540	132888	132890	Miss Lucy Steele	137	” said he , “
133912	134574	134579	134579	Robert	143	” The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such — so great — as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night . Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . Marianne could speak her happiness only by tears . Comparisons would occur — regrets would arise ; and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor — how are her feelings to be described ? From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,—saw him honourably released from his former engagement,—saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,—she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity ; and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;—for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor ’s company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;—for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . Between them no subject is finished , no communication is even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over . Lucy ’s marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;—and Elinor ’s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,—a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family — it was beyond her comprehension to make out . To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle . Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest . Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother ’s affairs might have done , if applied to in time . She repeated it to Edward . “
134581	134587	134579	134579	Robert	143	” was his immediate observation . “
134591	134596	134601	134601	his	143	” he presently added , “
134634	134772	134612	134612	Lucy	137	” How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual . Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;—and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . He put the letter into Elinor ’s hands . “
134776	134961	134773	134774	DEAR SIR	234	“ Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another ’s . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain , “
134973	134977	134773	134774	DEAR SIR	234	“ LUCY FERRARS . “
135013	135023	135024	135024	I	0	” Elinor read and returned it without any comment . “
135036	135038	135024	135024	I	0	” said Edward.—“For
135118	135119	135139	135140	your mother	2768	” “
135127	135133	135139	135140	your mother	2768	” said Elinor , after a pause,—“they
135230	135231	135232	135232	She	2768	” “
135264	135651	135652	135652	I	0	” In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy ’s letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking that fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he did , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions — they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself . Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother ’s anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him . “
135658	135662	135655	135655	my	0	” said he , “
135824	135825	135829	135829	she	2634	” “
135914	135981	135982	135982	Your	2641	” Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy ’s conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it . Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy . “
135989	135993	135982	135982	Your	2641	” said she ; “
136028	136051	136052	136052	I	0	” He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement . “
136187	136242	136264	136264	he	2646	” Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon ’s being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford—“Which
136247	136251	136264	136264	he	2646	” said he , “
136275	137029	137030	137030	I	0	” Now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . But so little interest had he taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome . They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain — and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life . Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on that he rested for the residue of their income . But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars ’s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert ’s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny . About four days after Edward ’s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs. Dashwood ’s satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold . Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ’ first tête - à - tête before breakfast . A three weeks ’ residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne ’s looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother ’s language , to make it cheerful . Among such friends , however , and such flattery , he did revive . No rumour of Lucy ’s marriage had yet reached him:—he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering . Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor . It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other ’s acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment . The letters from town , which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor ’s body thrill with transport , now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth . Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford . “

137250	137440	137242	137243	Miss Marianne	88	” Mr. Dashwood ’s strains were more solemn . Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women — poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility — and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder . Robert ’s offence was unpardonable , but Lucy ’s was infinitely worse . Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence . The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy ’s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family . He thus continued : — “
137571	137608	137555	137555	she	97	” This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward . It determined him to attempt a reconciliation , though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister . “
137615	137619	137621	137621	they	2657	” repeated he ; “
137686	137687	137673	137673	I	0	” “
137696	137700	137688	137688	You	0	” said Elinor , “
137734	137741	137744	137744	she	2768	” He agreed that he might . “
137772	137849	137766	137766	her	2768	” He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour . “
137858	137869	137766	137766	her	2768	” said Marianne , in her new character of candour , “
137890	138766	138767	138767	I	0	” After a visit on Colonel Brandon ’s side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together . They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town . CHAPTER L. After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son . Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating . For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again . In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;—told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;—and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit — and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward ’s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny . It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs. Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more . With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn . The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion - house ; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage , and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;—could chuse papers , project shrubberies , and invent a sweep . Mrs. Jennings ’s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world . They had in fact nothing to wish for , but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne , and rather better pasturage for their cows . They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends . Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour . “
