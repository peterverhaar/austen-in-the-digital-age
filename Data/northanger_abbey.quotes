Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil — she had no notion of drawing — not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover ’s profile , that she might be detected in the design . There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height . At present she did not know her own poverty , for she had no lover to portray . She had reached the age of seventeen , without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility , without having inspired one real passion , and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient . This was strange indeed ! but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out . There was not one lord in the neighbourhood ; no — not even a baronet . There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door — not one young man whose origin was unknown . Her father had no ward , and the squire of the parish no children . But when a young lady is to be a heroine , the perverseness of forty surrounding families can not prevent her . Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way . Mr. Allen , who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton , the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived , was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution — and his lady , a good - humoured woman , fond of Miss Morland , and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village , she must seek them abroad , invited her to go with them . Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance , and Catherine all happiness . CHAPTER 2 In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland ’s personal and mental endowments , when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks ’ residence in Bath , it may be stated , for the reader ’s more certain information , lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be , that her heart was affectionate ; her disposition cheerful and open , without conceit or affectation of any kind — her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl ; her person pleasing , and , when in good looks , pretty — and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is . When the hour of departure drew near , the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe . A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness , and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together ; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet . Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm - house , must , at such a moment , relieve the fulness of her heart . Who would not think so ? But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets , that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness , and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations . Her cautions were confined to the following points . “
1987	3069	3070	3070	I	0	” Sally , or rather Sarah ( for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can ? ) , must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister . It is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on Catherine ’s writing by every post , nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance , nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce . Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done , on the part of the Morlands , with a degree of moderation and composure , which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life , than with the refined susceptibilities , the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite . Her father , instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker , or even putting an hundred pounds bank - bill into her hands , gave her only ten guineas , and promised her more when she wanted it . Under these unpromising auspices , the parting took place , and the journey began . It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety . Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them , nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero . Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear , on Mrs. Allen ’s side , of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn , and that fortunately proved to be groundless . They arrived at Bath . Catherine was all eager delight — her eyes were here , there , everywhere , as they approached its fine and striking environs , and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel . She was come to be happy , and she felt happy already . They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street . It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen , that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work , and how she will , probably , contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable — whether by her imprudence , vulgarity , or jealousy — whether by intercepting her letters , ruining her character , or turning her out of doors . Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females , whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them . She had neither beauty , genius , accomplishment , nor manner . The air of a gentlewoman , a great deal of quiet , inactive good temper , and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible , intelligent man like Mr. Allen . In one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public , being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be . Dress was her passion . She had a most harmless delight in being fine ; and our heroine ’s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn , and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion . Catherine too made some purchases herself , and when all these matters were arranged , the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms . Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand , her clothes put on with care , and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do . With such encouragement , Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd . As for admiration , it was always very welcome when it came , but she did not depend on it . Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late . The season was full , the room crowded , and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could . As for Mr. Allen , he repaired directly to the card - room , and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves . With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protégée , Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door , as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow ; Catherine , however , kept close at her side , and linked her arm too firmly within her friend ’s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly . But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd ; it seemed rather to increase as they went on , whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door , they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience . But this was far from being the case , and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room , their situation was just the same ; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies . Still they moved on — something better was yet in view ; and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench . Here there was something less of crowd than below ; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her , and of all the dangers of her late passage through them . It was a splendid sight , and she began , for the first time that evening , to feel herself at a ball : she longed to dance , but she had not an acquaintance in the room . Mrs. Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly , every now and then , “
3087	3341	3084	3085	a partner	236	” For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes ; but they were repeated so often , and proved so totally ineffectual , that Catherine grew tired at last , and would thank her no more . They were not long able , however , to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained . Everybody was shortly in motion for tea , and they must squeeze out like the rest . Catherine began to feel something of disappointment — she was tired of being continually pressed against by people , the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest , and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives ; and when at last arrived in the tea - room , she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join , no acquaintance to claim , no gentleman to assist them . They saw nothing of Mr. Allen ; and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation , were obliged to sit down at the end of a table , at which a large party were already placed , without having anything to do there , or anybody to speak to , except each other . Mrs. Allen congratulated herself , as soon as they were seated , on having preserved her gown from injury . “
3353	3357	3084	3085	a partner	236	” said she , “
3390	3391	3386	3386	I	0	” “
3397	3401	3386	3386	I	0	” whispered Catherine , “
3410	3411	3386	3386	I	0	” “
3417	3426	3386	3386	I	0	” replied Mrs. Allen , with perfect serenity , “
3433	3434	3386	3386	I	0	” “
3465	3466	3450	3450	they	244	” “
3487	3488	3478	3478	I	0	” “
3501	3502	3496	3496	somebody	247	” “
3534	3535	3529	3529	they	90	” “
3558	3559	3555	3555	you	235	” “
3612	3613	3598	3598	Somebody	247	” “
3651	3652	3649	3649	somebody	247	” “
3727	3790	3700	3704	a strange - looking woman	258	” After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours ; it was thankfully accepted , and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it , which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening , till they were discovered and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over . “
3796	3802	3793	3794	Miss Morland	88	” said he , directly , “
3812	3813	3803	3803	I	0	” “
3818	3830	3803	3803	I	0	” she replied , vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn . “
3840	3845	3846	3846	I	0	” said his wife ; “
3909	3910	3911	3911	We	259	” “
3920	4451	3917	3917	I	0	” was Mr. Allen ’s consolation . The company began to disperse when the dancing was over — enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort ; and now was the time for a heroine , who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening , to be noticed and admired . Every five minutes , by removing some of the crowd , gave greater openings for her charms . She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before . Not one , however , started with rapturous wonder on beholding her , no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room , nor was she once called a divinity by anybody . Yet Catherine was in very good looks , and had the company only seen her three years before , they would now have thought her exceedingly handsome . She was looked at , however , and with some admiration ; for , in her own hearing , two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl . Such words had their due effect ; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before — her humble vanity was contented — she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms , and went to her chair in good humour with everybody , and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention . CHAPTER 3 Every morning now brought its regular duties — shops were to be visited ; some new part of the town to be looked at ; and the Pump - room to be attended , where they paraded up and down for an hour , looking at everybody and speaking to no one . The wish of a numerous acquaintance in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen , and she repeated it after every fresh proof , which every morning brought , of her knowing nobody at all . They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms ; and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine . The master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman - like young man as a partner ; his name was Tilney . He seemed to be about four or five and twenty , was rather tall , had a pleasing countenance , a very intelligent and lively eye , and , if not quite handsome , was very near it . His address was good , and Catherine felt herself in high luck . There was little leisure for speaking while they danced ; but when they were seated at tea , she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being . He talked with fluency and spirit — and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested , though it was hardly understood by her . After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with—“I
4541	4542	4536	4536	I	0	” “
4553	4554	4543	4543	You	264	” “
4564	4588	4558	4558	I	0	” Then forming his features into a set smile , and affectedly softening his voice , he added , with a simpering air , “
4598	4599	4590	4590	you	264	” “
4606	4615	4590	4590	you	264	” replied Catherine , trying not to laugh . “
4618	4623	4590	4590	you	264	” with affected astonishment . “
4632	4633	4626	4626	you	271	” “
4638	4647	4626	4626	you	271	” said he , in his natural tone . “
4689	4690	4682	4682	you	271	” “
4695	4696	4682	4682	you	271	” “
4707	4708	4711	4711	sir	271	” “
4719	4720	4711	4711	sir	271	” “
4728	4729	4732	4732	sir	271	” “
4742	4743	4734	4734	I	0	” “
4748	4749	4752	4752	sir	271	” “
4757	4758	4752	4752	sir	271	” “
4767	4768	4761	4761	you	271	” “
4777	4778	4771	4771	I	0	” “
4794	4810	4811	4811	I	0	” Catherine turned away her head , not knowing whether she might venture to laugh . “
4819	4822	4814	4814	you	264	” said he gravely—“I
4836	4837	4838	4838	My	0	” “
4841	4842	4838	4838	My	0	” “
4907	4908	4884	4905	a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense	288	” “
4917	4918	4910	4910	I	0	” “
4929	4930	4920	4920	I	0	” “
4935	4936	4937	4937	I	0	” “
4986	4987	4982	4982	you	264	” “
4997	4998	5000	5000	you	264	” “
5196	5197	5198	5198	I	0	” “
5203	5209	5198	5198	I	0	” said Catherine , doubtingly , “
5236	5237	5224	5224	I	0	” “
5270	5271	5275	5275	they	304	” “
5277	5278	5275	5275	they	304	” “
5299	5300	5302	5302	my	0	” “
5328	5329	5316	5316	You	264	” “
5381	5389	5390	5390	My	0	” They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen : “
5394	5398	5390	5390	My	0	” said she , “
5443	5444	5455	5455	madam	264	” “
5457	5467	5455	5455	madam	264	” said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin . “
5475	5476	5469	5469	you	0	” “
5551	5561	5562	5562	Men	306	” Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius . “
5572	5576	5562	5562	Men	306	” said she ; “
5604	5605	5592	5592	You	87	” “
5613	5614	5611	5611	madam	264	” “
5630	5631	5622	5622	you	271	” “
5639	5647	5637	5637	madam	264	” said he , gravely examining it ; “
5665	5666	5658	5658	I	0	” “
5671	5677	5669	5669	you	271	” said Catherine , laughing , “
5681	5686	5669	5669	you	271	” She had almost said “
5689	5690	5669	5669	you	271	” “
5700	5705	5691	5691	I	0	” replied Mrs. Allen ; “
5717	5718	5708	5708	I	0	” “
5794	5795	5775	5775	she	311	” “
5899	5951	5954	5954	you	330	” Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced . Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others . “
5960	5972	5954	5954	you	330	” said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; “
5996	6003	6004	6004	I	0	” Catherine coloured , and said , “
6011	6012	6004	6004	I	0	” “
6038	6039	6032	6032	you	0	” “
6047	6048	6050	6050	you	0	” “
6084	6440	6061	6061	I	0	” They danced again ; and , when the assembly closed , parted , on the lady ’s side at least , with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance . Whether she thought of him so much , while she drank her warm wine and water , and prepared herself for bed , as to dream of him when there , can not be ascertained ; but I hope it was no more than in a slight slumber , or a morning doze at most ; for if it be true , as a celebrated writer has maintained , that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman ’s love is declared,[1 ] it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her . How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen ’s head , but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied ; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was , and had been assured of Mr. Tilney ’s being a clergyman , and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire . [ 1 ] Vide a letter from Mr. Richardson , No . 97 , Vol . ii , Rambler . CHAPTER 4 With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump - room the next day , secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over , and ready to meet him with a smile ; but no smile was demanded — Mr. Tilney did not appear . Every creature in Bath , except himself , was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours ; crowds of people were every moment passing in and out , up the steps and down ; people whom nobody cared about , and nobody wanted to see ; and he only was absent . “
6448	6470	6061	6061	I	0	” said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock , after parading the room till they were tired ; “
6484	6517	6061	6061	I	0	” This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now ; but we are told to “
6525	6527	6061	6061	I	0	” as “
6534	6603	6604	6604	I	0	” ; and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward , for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age , who was sitting by her , and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes , addressed her with great complaisance in these words : “
6636	6964	6634	6634	Allen	89	” This question answered , as it readily was , the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe ; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate , whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages , and that many years ago . Their joy on this meeting was very great , as well it might , since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years . Compliments on good looks now passed ; and , after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together , how little they had thought of meeting in Bath , and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend , they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families , sisters , and cousins , talking both together , far more ready to give than to receive information , and each hearing very little of what the other said . Mrs. Thorpe , however , had one great advantage as a talker , over Mrs. Allen , in a family of children ; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons , and the beauty of her daughters , when she related their different situations and views — that John was at Oxford , Edward at Merchant Taylors ’ , and William at sea — and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were , Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give , no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend , and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions , consoling herself , however , with the discovery , which her keen eyes soon made , that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe ’s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own . “
6971	6995	6967	6969	my dear girls	337	” cried Mrs. Thorpe , pointing at three smart - looking females who , arm in arm , were then moving towards her . “
7048	7100	7043	7043	Isabella	105	” The Miss Thorpes were introduced ; and Miss Morland , who had been for a short time forgotten , was introduced likewise . The name seemed to strike them all ; and , after speaking to her with great civility , the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest , “
7110	7111	7106	7107	Miss Morland	88	” “
7119	7125	7130	7130	her	105	” cried the mother — and “
7136	8343	7130	7130	her	105	” was repeated by them all , two or three times over . For a moment Catherine was surprised ; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland , before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college , of the name of Thorpe ; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with his family , near London . The whole being explained , many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her ; of being considered as already friends , through the friendship of their brothers , etc . , which Catherine heard with pleasure , and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command ; and , as the first proof of amity , she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe , and take a turn with her about the room . Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance , and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe . Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love . Their conversation turned upon those subjects , of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies : such as dress , balls , flirtations , and quizzes . Miss Thorpe , however , being four years older than Miss Morland , and at least four years better informed , had a very decided advantage in discussing such points ; she could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge , its fashions with the fashions of London ; could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire ; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other ; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd . These powers received due admiration from Catherine , to whom they were entirely new ; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity , had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe ’s manners , and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her , softened down every feeling of awe , and left nothing but tender affection . Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump - room , but required , when they all quitted it together , that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen ’s house ; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands , after learning , to their mutual relief , that they should see each other across the theatre at night , and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning . Catherine then ran directly upstairs , and watched Miss Thorpe ’s progress down the street from the drawing - room window ; admired the graceful spirit of her walk , the fashionable air of her figure and dress ; and felt grateful , as well she might , for the chance which had procured her such a friend . Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty , and the younger ones , by pretending to be as handsome as their sister , imitating her air , and dressing in the same style , did very well . This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself , of her past adventures and sufferings , which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters ; in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth , and conversations , which had passed twenty years before , be minutely repeated . CHAPTER 5 Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain . Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump - room . She hoped to be more fortunate the next day ; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning , she hardly felt a doubt of it ; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants , and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is . As soon as divine service was over , the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other ; and after staying long enough in the pump - room to discover that the crowd was insupportable , and that there was not a genteel face to be seen , which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season , they hastened away to the Crescent , to breathe the fresh air of better company . Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner . He was nowhere to be met with ; every search for him was equally unsuccessful , in morning lounges or evening assemblies ; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms , at dressed or undressed balls , was he perceivable ; nor among the walkers , the horsemen , or the curricle - drivers of the morning . His name was not in the pump - room book , and curiosity could do no more . He must be gone from Bath . Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short ! this sort of mysteriousness , which is always so becoming in a hero , threw a fresh grace in Catherine ’s imagination around his person and manners , and increased her anxiety to know more of him . From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen . It was a subject , however , in which she often indulged with her fair friend , from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him ; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken . Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return . She liked him the better for being a clergyman , “
8354	8484	8485	8485	I	0	” ; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it . Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion — but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced . Mrs. Allen was now quite happy — quite satisfied with Bath . She had found some acquaintance , had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend ; and , as the completion of good fortune , had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself . Her daily expressions were no longer , “
8494	8500	8485	8485	I	0	” They were changed into , “
8512	9032	8509	8510	Mrs. Thorpe	100	” and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns . The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm , and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves . They called each other by their Christian name , were always arm in arm when they walked , pinned up each other ’s train for the dance , and were not to be divided in the set ; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments , they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt , and shut themselves up , to read novels together . Yes , novels ; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel - writers , of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances , to the number of which they are themselves adding — joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works , and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine , who , if she accidentally take up a novel , is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust . Alas ! if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another , from whom can she expect protection and regard ? I can not approve of it . Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure , and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans . Let us not desert one another ; we are an injured body . Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world , no species of composition has been so much decried . From pride , ignorance , or fashion , our foes are almost as many as our readers . And while the abilities of the nine - hundredth abridger of the History of England , or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton , Pope , and Prior , with a paper from the Spectator , and a chapter from Sterne , are eulogized by a thousand pens — there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist , and of slighting the performances which have only genius , wit , and taste to recommend them . “
9064	9072	9076	9076	you	0	” Such is the common ca nt . “
9083	9084	9079	9079	Miss	348	” “
9093	9113	9079	9079	Miss	348	” replies the young lady , while she lays down her book with affected indifference , or momentary shame . “
9124	9390	9391	9391	My	0	” ; or , in short , only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed , in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature , the happiest delineation of its varieties , the liveliest effusions of wit and humour , are conveyed to the world in the best - chosen language . Now , had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator , instead of such a work , how proudly would she have produced the book , and told its name ; though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication , of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste : the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances , unnatural characters , and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living ; and their language , too , frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it . CHAPTER 6 The following conversation , which took place between the two friends in the pump - room one morning , after an acquaintance of eight or nine days , is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment , and of the delicacy , discretion , originality of thought , and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment . They met by appointment ; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend , her first address naturally was , “
9414	9415	9403	9403	I	0	” “
9454	9455	9445	9445	I	0	” “
9608	9609	9606	9606	Udolpho	111	” “

9665	9666	9660	9660	you	349	” “
9757	9758	9759	9760	Dear creature	357	” “

9820	9821	9822	9822	I	0	” “
9872	9873	9881	9881	they	359	” “

10162	10168	10171	10171	you	374	” cried Catherine , colouring . “
10175	10176	10171	10171	you	374	” “
10244	10255	10237	10237	he	377	” Catherine coloured , and disclaimed again . Isabella laughed . “
10297	10299	10293	10293	I	0	you”—speaking more seriously—“your
10353	10354	10346	10346	i	0	” “
10380	10381	10384	10384	him	97	” “

10503	10504	10507	10507	she	82	” “
10530	10531	10532	10534	Sir Charles Grandison	116	” “
10559	10560	10549	10550	Miss Andrews	114	” “
10578	10579	10581	10581	you	374	” “
10639	10640	10628	10629	The men	366	” “
10650	10657	10647	10647	they	366	” said Catherine , very innocently . “
10698	10699	10701	10701	they	366	” “
10718	10719	10710	10710	They	366	” “
10785	10786	10777	10777	you	77	” “
10817	10818	10822	10822	Catherine	77	” “
10901	10902	10908	10908	you	77	” “
10911	10912	10908	10908	you	77	” “
10934	10986	10920	10920	I	0	” Catherine , in some amazement , complied , and after remaining a few moments silent , was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world , Laurentina ’s skeleton , when her friend prevented her , by saying , “
11048	11078	11041	11041	They	395	” Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine ’s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men . “
11119	11151	11110	11110	I	0	” In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room . “
11159	11167	11168	11168	One	294	” said Isabella , turning hastily round . “
11178	11179	11170	11176	a very good - looking young man	399	” “
11188	11189	11180	11180	They	395	” “
11234	11239	11225	11225	You	0	” Catherine readily agreed . “
11242	11246	11225	11225	You	0	” she added , “
11256	11257	11225	11225	You	0	” “
11286	11287	11277	11277	I	0	” “
11309	11310	11311	11311	I	0	” “
11343	11631	11322	11322	you	0	” Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning ; and therefore , to show the independence of Miss Thorpe , and her resolution of humbling the sex , they set off immediately as fast as they could walk , in pursuit of the two young men . CHAPTER 7 Half a minute conducted them through the pump - yard to the archway , opposite Union Passage ; but here they were stopped . Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at this point ; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature , so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads , and the principal inn of the city , that a day never passes in which parties of ladies , however important their business , whether in quest of pastry , millinery , or even ( as in the present case ) of young men , are not detained on one side or other by carriages , horsemen , or carts . This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing - looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse . “
11638	11645	11322	11322	you	0	” said Isabella , looking up . “
11651	11672	11322	11322	you	0	” But this detestation , though so just , was of short duration , for she looked again and exclaimed , “
11682	11683	11675	11677	mr . Morland	77	” “
11691	11999	11689	11689	James	107	” was uttered at the same moment by Catherine ; and , on catching the young men ’s eyes , the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches , and the servant having now scampered up , the gentlemen jumped out , and the equipage was delivered to his care . Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself . John Thorpe , who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses , soon joined them , and from him she directly received the amends which were her due ; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella , on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow . He was a stout young man of middling height , who , with a plain face and ungraceful form , seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom , and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil , and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy . He took out his watch : “
12016	12017	12003	12003	you	406	” “
12025	12038	12003	12003	you	406	” Her brother told her that it was twenty - three miles . “
12045	12049	12003	12003	you	406	” cried Thorpe , “
12061	12093	12094	12094	I	0	” Morland remonstrated , pleaded the authority of road - books , innkeepers , and milestones ; but his friend disregarded them all ; he had a surer test of distance . “
12105	12109	12094	12094	I	0	” said he , “
12172	12173	12174	12174	You	410	” “
12180	12184	12174	12174	You	410	” said Morland ; “
12196	12197	12174	12174	You	410	” “
12250	12265	12237	12237	you	88	” ( The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off . ) “
12297	12298	12299	12299	He	412	” “
12309	12310	12299	12299	He	412	” “
12560	12561	12562	12562	I	0	” “
12572	12573	12562	12562	I	0	” “
12637	12638	12640	12640	I	0	” “
12644	12648	12640	12640	I	0	” said Catherine , “
12668	12669	12640	12640	I	0	” “
12698	12699	12693	12694	poor Freeman	118	” “
12709	12716	12707	12707	you	0	” said Catherine , quite pleased . “
12744	12907	12908	12908	You	422	” An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies ; and , on finding whither they were going , it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar ’s Buildings , and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe . James and Isabella led the way ; and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot , so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother ’s friend , and her friend ’s brother , so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings , that , though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street , she was so far from seeking to attract their notice , that she looked back at them only three times . John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine , and , after a few minutes ’ silence , renewed the conversation about his gig . “
12961	12962	12953	12953	Morland	88	” “
12965	12973	12953	12953	Morland	88	” said Morland , who overheard this ; “
12983	12984	12985	12985	My	0	” “
13016	13017	13006	13006	you	422	” “
13041	13042	13034	13034	I	0	” “
13059	13060	13049	13049	I	0	” “
13064	13084	13062	13062	you	422	” said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer . “
13096	13097	13099	13099	you	422	” “
13109	13110	13113	13113	he	425	” “
13164	13165	13167	13167	you	422	” “
13170	13176	13167	13167	you	422	” said Catherine very seriously . “
13185	13186	13167	13167	you	422	” “
13216	13217	13212	13212	I	0	” “
13224	13231	13232	13232	My	0	” cried Isabella , turning round . “
13257	13258	13242	13242	I	0	” “
13295	13427	13288	13288	morland	77	” This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two ; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result . Her companion ’s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met ; and Catherine , after listening and agreeing as long as she could , with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind , fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self - assured man , especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned , ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts ; it was , “
13437	13438	13439	13439	Udolpho	111	” “
13460	13482	13453	13453	I	0	” Catherine , humbled and ashamed , was going to apologize for her question , but he prevented her by saying , “
13532	13533	13534	13534	I	0	” “
13554	13555	13557	13557	I	0	” “
13593	13594	13595	13595	Udolpho	111	” “
13602	13617	13599	13600	Mrs. Radcliffe	123	” said Catherine , with some hesitation , from the fear of mortifying him . “
13661	13662	13667	13667	Camilla	110	” “
13669	13670	13667	13667	Camilla	110	” “
13751	13752	13753	13753	I	0	” “
13759	13760	13753	13753	I	0	” “
13808	13874	13877	13877	Mother	193	” This critique , the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine , brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe ’s lodgings , and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son , as they met Mrs. Thorpe , who had descried them from above , in the passage . “
13884	13897	13877	13877	Mother	193	” said he , giving her a hearty shake of the hand . “
13945	14174	14181	14181	you	77	” And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother ’s heart , for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection . On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness , for he asked each of them how they did , and observed that they both looked very ugly . These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening . Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen ’s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , “
14187	14211	14185	14185	Thorpe	101	” instead of answering , as she probably would have done , had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case , “
14220	14225	14185	14185	Thorpe	101	” she directly replied , “
14237	14238	14232	14232	he	101	” “
14280	14281	14272	14272	you	77	” “
14291	14292	14288	14288	Isabella	105	” “
14379	14386	14351	14351	She	105	” taking her hand with affection , “
14392	14393	14351	14351	She	105	” “
14398	14402	14395	14395	I	0	” she replied ; “
14435	14436	14426	14426	you	77	” “
14508	14509	14506	14506	she	105	” “
14529	14530	14534	14534	he	87	” “
14604	14605	14591	14592	the Allens	457	” “
14647	14670	14673	14673	Catherine	77	” James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “
14680	15087	15088	15088	I	0	” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet . A pre - engagement in Edgar ’s Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend , and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other . The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted , Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised , restless , and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho , lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner , incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen ’s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker , and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity , in being already engaged for the evening . CHAPTER 8 In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker , however , the party from Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time . The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them ; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste , of admiring the set of her gown , and envying the curl of her hair , they followed their chaperons , arm in arm , into the ballroom , whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred , and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection . The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated ; and James , who had been engaged quite as long as his sister , was very importunate with Isabella to stand up ; but John was gone into the card - room to speak to a friend , and nothing , she declared , should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too . “
15092	15096	15088	15088	I	0	” said she , “
15124	15167	15168	15169	My dear	235	” Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude , and they continued as they were for three minutes longer , when Isabella , who had been talking to James on the other side of her , turned again to his sister and whispered , “
15220	15257	15200	15200	I	0	” Catherine , though a little disappointed , had too much good nature to make any opposition , and the others rising up , Isabella had only time to press her friend ’s hand and say , “
15266	15798	15200	15200	I	0	” before they hurried off . The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing , Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen , between whom she now remained . She could not help being vexed at the non - appearance of Mr. Thorpe , for she not only longed to be dancing , but was likewise aware that , as the real dignity of her situation could not be known , she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner . To be disgraced in the eye of the world , to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity , her actions all innocence , and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement , is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine ’s life , and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character . Catherine had fortitude too ; she suffered , but no murmur passed her lips . From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance . He looked as handsome and as lively as ever , and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing - looking young woman , who leant on his arm , and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister ; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever , by being married already . But guided only by what was simple and probable , it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married ; he had not behaved , he had not talked , like the married men to whom she had been used ; he had never mentioned a wife , and he had acknowledged a sister . From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister ’s now being by his side ; and therefore , instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen ’s bosom , Catherine sat erect , in the perfect use of her senses , and with cheeks only a little redder than usual . Mr. Tilney and his companion , who continued , though slowly , to approach , were immediately preceded by a lady , an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe ; and this lady stopping to speak to her , they , as belonging to her , stopped likewise , and Catherine , catching Mr. Tilney ’s eye , instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition . She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged . “
15820	15853	15856	15856	sir	271	” He thanked her for her fears , and said that he had quitted it for a week , on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her . “
15954	15955	15938	15938	I	0	” “
15981	15982	15993	15993	he	87	” “
16018	16019	16001	16002	Dr. Skinner	124	” “
16027	16028	16031	16031	sir	271	” “
16060	16400	16047	16048	Mr. Allen	87	” Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen , that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats , as they had agreed to join their party . This was accordingly done , Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them ; and after a few minutes ’ consideration , he asked Catherine to dance with him . This compliment , delightful as it was , produced severe mortification to the lady ; and in giving her denial , she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it , that had Thorpe , who joined her just afterwards , been half a minute earlier , he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute . The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot ; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up , of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left , and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them , interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney . Of her dear Isabella , to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman , she could see nothing . They were in different sets . She was separated from all her party , and away from all her acquaintance ; one mortification succeeded another , and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson , that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady . From such a moralizing strain as this , she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder , and turning round , perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her , attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman . “
16409	16413	16403	16403	your	478	” said she , “
16451	16776	16432	16432	she	100	” Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine . The young ladies were introduced to each other , Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness , Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation ; and Mrs. Hughes , satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge , returned to her party . Miss Tilney had a good figure , a pretty face , and a very agreeable countenance ; and her air , though it had not all the decided pretension , the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe ’s , had more real elegance . Her manners showed good sense and good breeding ; they were neither shy nor affectedly open ; and she seemed capable of being young , attractive , and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her , and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence . Catherine , interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney , was desirous of being acquainted with her , and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say , and had courage and leisure for saying it . But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy , by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites , prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance , by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath , how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country , whether she drew , or played , or sang , and whether she was fond of riding on horseback . The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella , who in great spirits exclaimed , “
16824	16825	16826	16826	My	0	” “
16850	16851	16841	16841	I	0	” “
16941	16942	16930	16930	You	77	” “
16956	16966	16930	16930	You	77	” whispered Catherine , detaching her friend from James . “
16974	16975	16969	16970	Mr. Tilney	97	” “
17056	17057	17049	17049	We	491	” “
17071	17072	17049	17049	We	491	” “
17120	17121	17108	17108	you	107	” “
17134	17135	17131	17131	you	107	” “
17187	17264	17265	17265	I	0	” In this commonplace chatter , which lasted some time , the original subject seemed entirely forgotten ; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while , she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella ’s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney . When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance , James would have led his fair partner away , but she resisted . “
17272	17276	17265	17265	I	0	” she cried , “
17356	17357	17359	17359	my	0	” “
17362	17366	17359	17359	my	0	” said James , “
17380	17381	17386	17386	you	107	” “
17443	17444	17423	17423	him	463	” “
17464	17465	17458	17458	you	77	” “
17468	17472	17458	17458	you	77	” cried Isabella , “
17528	17618	17516	17516	Catherine	77	” And off they went , to regain their former place . John Thorpe , in the meanwhile , had walked away ; and Catherine , ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once , made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could , in the hope of finding him still with them — a hope which , when it proved to be fruitless , she felt to have been highly unreasonable . “
17624	17636	17516	17516	Catherine	77	” said Mrs. Thorpe , impatient for praise of her son , “
17646	17647	17642	17644	an agreeable partner	509	” “
17653	17654	17651	17651	madam	264	” “
17670	17671	17668	17668	he	101	” “
17681	17686	17691	17691	he	101	” said Mrs. Allen . “
17693	17694	17695	17695	He	101	” “
17736	17737	17725	17725	he	101	” “
17743	17769	17725	17725	he	101	” said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . “
17785	17799	17780	17780	he	101	” said Mrs. Allen ; and after a short silence , she added , “
17808	17809	17811	17811	he	101	” “
17817	17825	17814	17815	Mrs. Allen	89	” said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; “
17850	17890	17894	17894	she	518	” This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment ’s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , “
17903	17952	17894	17894	she	518	” Catherine was disappointed and vexed . She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view ; and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply , when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said , “
17973	17974	17962	17962	I	0	” “
18009	18010	18013	18013	you	88	” “
18060	18153	18050	18050	I	0	” Again Catherine excused herself ; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself . The rest of the evening she found very dull ; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea , to attend that of his partner ; Miss Tilney , though belonging to it , did not sit near her , and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile , one squeeze , and one “
18157	18580	18155	18155	Catherine	77	” CHAPTER 9 The progress of Catherine ’s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows . It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her , while she remained in the rooms , which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home . This , on arriving in Pulteney Street , took the direction of extraordinary hunger , and when that was appeased , changed into an earnest longing to be in bed ; such was the extreme point of her distress ; for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours , and from which she awoke perfectly revived , in excellent spirits , with fresh hopes and fresh schemes . The first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney , and almost her first resolution , to seek her for that purpose , in the pump - room at noon . In the pump - room , one so newly arrived in Bath must be met with , and that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence , and the completion of female intimacy , so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence , that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls . Her plan for the morning thus settled , she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast , resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one ; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen , whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such , that as she never talked a great deal , so she could never be entirely silent ; and , therefore , while she sat at her work , if she lost her needle or broke her thread , if she heard a carriage in the street , or saw a speck upon her gown , she must observe it aloud , whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not . At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , “
18688	18689	18680	18680	They	342	” “
18695	18699	18680	18680	They	342	” said Catherine . “
18707	18708	18680	18680	They	342	” “
18746	18747	18736	18736	you	88	” “
18757	18769	18736	18736	you	88	” said Catherine , looking at Mrs. Allen for her opinion ; “
18778	18779	18772	18772	I	0	” “
18805	18910	18917	18917	you	88	” Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer . “
18936	18937	18941	18941	you	88	” “
18947	19024	18941	18941	you	88	” replied Mrs. Allen , with the most placid indifference . Catherine took the advice , and ran off to get ready . In a very few minutes she reappeared , having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise , after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen ’s admiration of his gig ; and then receiving her friend ’s parting good wishes , they both hurried downstairs . “
19029	19050	18941	18941	you	88	” cried Isabella , to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage , “
19101	19123	19128	19128	she	363	” Catherine followed her orders and turned away , but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James , “
19137	19138	19131	19131	i	0	” “
19148	19158	19139	19139	You	235	” said Thorpe , as he handed her in , “
19220	19303	19547	19547	he	127	” Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one , but it was too late to retreat , and she was too young to own herself frightened ; so , resigning herself to her fate , and trusting to the animal ’s boasted knowledge of its owner , she sat peaceably down , and saw Thorpe sit down by her . Everything being then arranged , the servant who stood at the horse ’s head was bid in an important voice “
19309	19535	19547	19547	he	127	” and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable , without a plunge or a caper , or anything like one . Catherine , delighted at so happy an escape , spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise ; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins , and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip . Catherine , though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse , he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks , congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman ; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner , without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity , and ( considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour ) by no means alarmingly fast , gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind , in a fine mild day of February , with the consciousness of safety . A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue ; it was broken by Thorpe ’s saying very abruptly , “
19549	19566	19547	19547	he	127	” Catherine did not understand him — and he repeated his question , adding in explanation , “
19576	19577	19567	19568	Old Allen	127	” “
19597	19598	19592	19592	he	127	” “
19605	19606	19589	19589	I	0	” “
19612	19613	19589	19589	I	0	” “
19631	19632	19629	19629	he	127	” “
19638	19639	19629	19629	he	127	” “
19649	19650	19641	19641	you	541	” “
19656	19657	19641	19641	you	541	” “
19705	19706	19697	19697	he	127	” “
19741	19742	19731	19731	you	541	” “
19815	19816	19817	19817	I	0	” “
19823	19824	19817	19817	I	0	” “
19862	19863	19856	19856	Our	554	” “
19881	19882	19856	19856	Our	554	” “
20007	20008	20295	20296	Mr. Thorpe	120	” “
20017	20022	20295	20296	Mr. Thorpe	120	” said Catherine warmly , “
20054	20288	20289	20289	You	562	” This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply , of which no part was very distinct , except the frequent exclamations , amounting almost to oaths , which adorned it , and Catherine was left , when it ended , with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford , and the same happy conviction of her brother ’s comparative sobriety . Thorpe ’s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage , and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along , and the ease which his paces , as well as the excellence of the springs , gave the motion of the carriage . She followed him in all his admiration as well as she could . To go before or beyond him was impossible . His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject , his rapidity of expression , and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power ; she could strike out nothing new in commendation , but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert , and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in England , his carriage the neatest , his horse the best goer , and himself the best coachman . “
20298	20324	20289	20289	You	562	” said Catherine , venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided , and to offer some little variation on the subject , “
20333	20334	20295	20296	Mr. Thorpe	120	” “
20437	20438	20421	20421	I	0	” “
20442	20449	20421	20421	I	0	” cried Catherine , quite frightened . “
20494	20495	20475	20476	Mr. Thorpe	120	” “
20597	21197	20577	20577	i	0	” Catherine listened with astonishment ; she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing ; for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle , nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead . Her own family were plain , matter - of - fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind ; her father , at the utmost , being contented with a pun , and her mother with a proverb ; they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance , or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next . She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity , and was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject ; but she checked herself , because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights , in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous ; and , joining to this , the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them , she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe , and therefore would alarm herself no longer . By him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten ; and all the rest of his conversation , or rather talk , began and ended with himself and his own concerns . He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums ; of racing matches , in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner ; of shooting parties , in which he had killed more birds ( though without having one good shot ) than all his companions together ; and described to her some famous day ’s sport , with the fox - hounds , in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman , and in which the boldness of his riding , though it had never endangered his own life for a moment , had been constantly leading others into difficulties , which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many . Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself , and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be , she could not entirely repress a doubt , while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit , of his being altogether completely agreeable . It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure . When they arrived at Mrs. Allen ’s door , the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed , on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house : “
21202	21449	20577	20577	i	0	” It was inconceivable , incredible , impossible ! and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother ’s , nor the servant ’s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer then , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend ’s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer . Her own feelings entirely engrossed her ; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home . It was ages since she had had a moment ’s conversation with her dearest Catherine ; and , though she had such thousands of things to say to her , it appeared as if they were never to be together again ; so , with smiles of most exquisite misery , and the laughing eye of utter despondency , she bade her friend adieu and went on . Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , “
21459	21473	21456	21456	you	235	” a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; “
21484	21485	21475	21475	I	0	” “
21503	21504	21510	21510	she	100	” “
21519	21520	21510	21510	she	100	” “
21529	21530	21524	21525	Mrs. Thorpe	100	” “
21584	21585	21563	21563	She	100	” “
21595	21596	21587	21587	you	235	” “
21625	21626	21628	21628	you	235	” “
21638	21639	21633	21633	they	578	” “
21698	21699	21686	21687	Mrs. Hughes	125	” “
21709	21710	21703	21703	she	125	” “
21725	21726	21718	21718	she	125	” “
21739	21740	21743	21743	she	125	” “
21826	21827	21813	21814	Mrs. Hughes	125	” “
21837	21838	21843	21843	they	1903	” “
21927	21928	21909	21910	Miss Tilney	94	” “
21941	21942	21931	21932	Mr. Tilney	97	” “
21985	22157	21974	21975	Mrs. Hughes	125	” Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister . Could she have foreseen such a circumstance , nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others ; and , as it was , she could only lament her ill luck , and think over what she had lost , till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable . CHAPTER 10 The Allens , Thorpes , and Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre ; and , as Catherine and Isabella sat together , there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them . “
22173	22188	22164	22164	Catherine	77	” was her address on Catherine ’s entering the box and sitting by her . “
22194	22206	22191	22192	Mr. Morland	107	” for he was close to her on the other side , “
22404	22405	22402	22402	him	97	” “
22408	22412	22402	22402	him	97	” said Catherine , “
22425	22426	22438	22438	him	97	” “
22584	22585	22572	22572	you	77	” “
22593	22594	22598	22598	you	77	” “
22661	22662	22664	22664	you	77	” “
22696	23177	22685	22685	I	0	” Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to James . Catherine ’s resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning ; and till the usual moment of going to the pump - room , she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention . But nothing of that kind occurred , no visitors appeared to delay them , and they all three set off in good time for the pump - room , where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place ; Mr. Allen , after drinking his glass of water , joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers ; and the ladies walked about together , noticing every new face , and almost every new bonnet in the room . The female part of the Thorpe family , attended by James Morland , appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour , and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend . James , who was now in constant attendance , maintained a similar position , and separating themselves from the rest of their party , they walked in that manner for some time , till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which , confining her entirely to her friend and brother , gave her very little share in the notice of either . They were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute , but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices , and their vivacity attended with so much laughter , that though Catherine ’s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other , she was never able to give any , from not having heard a word of the subject . At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend , by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney , whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs. Hughes , and whom she instantly joined , with a firmer determination to be acquainted , than she might have had courage to command , had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before . Miss Tilney met her with great civility , returned her advances with equal goodwill , and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room ; and though in all probability not an observation was made , nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before , under that roof , in every Bath season , yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth , and without personal conceit , might be something uncommon . “
23184	23208	23209	23209	Henry	97	” was an artless exclamation of Catherine ’s towards the close of their conversation , which at once surprised and amused her companion . “
23211	23218	23209	23209	Henry	97	” she replied with a smile . “
23227	23228	23229	23229	He	97	” “
23267	23274	23264	23265	Mr. Thorpe	120	” Miss Tilney could only bow . “
23280	23289	23264	23265	Mr. Thorpe	120	” added Catherine after a moment ’s silence , “
23310	23311	23299	23299	I	0	” “
23342	23343	23333	23333	He	97	” “
23380	23381	23376	23378	a Miss Smith	132	” “
23390	23391	23387	23388	Mrs. Hughes	125	” “
23408	23409	23403	23403	you	0	” “
23413	23414	23403	23403	you	0	” “
23427	23428	23415	23415	He	97	” “
23444	23462	23434	23434	he	97	” Mrs. Hughes now joined them , and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to go . “
23476	23480	23465	23465	I	0	” said Catherine . “
23492	23493	23482	23482	you	0	” “
23505	23506	23507	23507	I	0	” “
23520	24104	23507	23507	I	0	” This civility was duly returned ; and they parted — on Miss Tilney ’s side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance ’s feelings , and on Catherine ’s , without the smallest consciousness of having explained them . She went home very happy . The morning had answered all her hopes , and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation , the future good . What gown and what head - dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern . She can not be justified in it . Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction , and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim . Catherine knew all this very well ; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before ; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin , and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening . This would have been an error in judgment , great though not uncommon , from which one of the other sex rather than her own , a brother rather than a great aunt , might have warned her , for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown . It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies , could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire ; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin , and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted , the sprigged , the mull , or the jackonet . Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone . No man will admire her the more , no woman will like her the better for it . Neatness and fashion are enough for the former , and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter . But not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine . She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before . She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe , and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight , lest he should engage her again ; for though she could not , dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to dance , her wishes , hopes , and plans all centred in nothing less . Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment , for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation . All have been , or at least all have believed themselves to be , in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid ; and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please . As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes , Catherine ’s agony began ; she fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her , hid herself as much as possible from his view , and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him . The cotillions were over , the country - dancing beginning , and she saw nothing of the Tilneys . “
24114	24118	24112	24112	Catherine	77	” whispered Isabella , “
24187	24408	24179	24179	he	463	” Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer . The others walked away , John Thorpe was still in view , and she gave herself up for lost . That she might not appear , however , to observe or expect him , she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan ; and a self - condemnation for her folly , in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time , had just passed through her mind , when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance , by Mr. Tilney himself . With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request , and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set , may be easily imagined . To escape , and , as she believed , so narrowly escape John Thorpe , and to be asked , so immediately on his joining her , asked by Mr. Tilney , as if he had sought her on purpose!—it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity . Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place , however , when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe , who stood behind her . “
24414	24418	24411	24412	Miss Morland	88	” said he . “
24436	24437	24438	24438	I	0	” “

24631	24637	24638	24638	Tilney	97	” Catherine satisfied his curiosity . “
24640	24644	24645	24645	Hum	135	” he repeated . “
24808	24851	24852	24853	That gentleman	2078	” This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine ’s attention , for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies . Her partner now drew near , and said , “
24980	24981	24983	24983	they	648	” “
24990	24991	24983	24983	they	648	” “

26018	26026	26032	26033	Mrs. Allen	89	” Mr. Tilney was very much amused . “
26035	26039	26032	26033	Mrs. Allen	89	” he repeated . “
26081	26082	26064	26064	You	0	” “
26202	26203	26204	26213	Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort	709	” “
26264	26408	26412	26412	you	717	” Here their conversation closed , the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention . Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set , Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers - on , immediately behind her partner . He was a very handsome man , of a commanding aspect , past the bloom , but not past the vigour of life ; and with his eye still directed towards her , she saw him presently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper . Confused by his notice , and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance , she turned away her head . But while she did so , the gentleman retreated , and her partner , coming nearer , said , “
26444	26450	26438	26439	General Tilney	139	” Catherine ’s answer was only “
26451	26455	26441	26442	my father	616	Oh!”—but it was an “
26458	26497	26441	26442	my father	616	” expressing everything needful : attention to his words , and perfect reliance on their truth . With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the General , as he moved through the crowd , and “
26505	26607	26608	26608	I	0	” was her secret remark . In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded , a new source of felicity arose to her . She had never taken a country walk since her arrival in Bath . Miss Tilney , to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar , spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too ; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her , it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk , some morning or other . “
26613	26617	26608	26608	I	0	” she cried , “
26640	26685	26438	26439	General Tilney	139	” This was readily agreed to , with only a proviso of Miss Tilney ’s , that it did not rain , which Catherine was sure it would not . At twelve o’clock , they were to call for her in Pulteney Street ; and “
26691	26894	26895	26895	She	723	” was her parting speech to her new friend . Of her other , her older , her more established friend , Isabella , of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight ’s experience , she scarcely saw anything during the evening . Yet , though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness , she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen , which took them rather early away , and her spirits danced within her , as she danced in her chair all the way home . CHAPTER 11 The morrow brought a very sober - looking morning , the sun making only a few efforts to appear , and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes . A bright morning so early in the year , she allowed , would generally turn to rain , but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced . She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes , but Mr. Allen , not having his own skies and barometer about him , declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine . She applied to Mrs. Allen , and Mrs. Allen ’s opinion was more positive . “
26924	26948	26895	26895	She	723	” At about eleven o’clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine ’s watchful eye , and “
26961	26971	26953	26953	I	0	” broke from her in a most desponding tone . “
26979	26984	26972	26972	I	0	” said Mrs. Allen . “
26993	26997	26972	26972	I	0	” sighed Catherine ; “
27014	27015	26953	26953	I	0	” “
27032	27033	26953	26953	I	0	” “
27046	27047	27041	27041	I	0	” “
27050	27057	27041	27041	I	0	” replied her friend very placidly , “
27065	27071	27041	27041	I	0	” After a short pause , “
27079	27091	27041	27041	I	0	” said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window . “
27109	27110	27119	27119	I	0	” “
27127	27128	27119	27119	I	0	” “
27147	27148	27136	27136	I	0	” “
27167	27168	27169	27169	Anybody	202	” “
27245	27300	27301	27301	You	0	” The rain continued — fast , though not heavy . Catherine went every five minutes to the clock , threatening on each return that , if it still kept on raining another five minutes , she would give up the matter as hopeless . The clock struck twelve , and it still rained . “
27312	27313	27301	27301	You	0	” “
27407	27500	27615	27615	they	736	” At half past twelve , when Catherine ’s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment , the sky began voluntarily to clear . A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise ; she looked round ; the clouds were parting , and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance . Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed , and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen , who had “
27508	27602	27603	27603	Isabella	105	” But whether Catherine might still expect her friends , whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture , must yet be a question . It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back . “
27643	27681	27637	27638	Miss Tilney	94	” Mrs. Allen agreed to it . John Thorpe was soon with them , and his voice was with them yet sooner , for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick . “
27688	27696	27637	27638	Miss Tilney	94	” as he threw open the door . “
27725	27726	27722	27723	Mrs. Allen	89	” “
27764	27799	27800	27800	My	0	” This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all ; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him , and the two others walked in , to give their assistance . “
27942	27943	27944	27944	I	0	” “
27954	27958	27959	27959	You	743	” said Morland . “
27963	27967	27959	27961	You croaking fellow	744	” cried Thorpe . “
28006	28007	28001	28001	she	314	” “
28011	28015	28001	28001	she	314	” cried Catherine . “
28020	28021	28001	28001	she	314	” “
28038	28039	28001	28001	she	314	” “
28052	28053	28001	28001	she	314	” “

28079	28080	28067	28067	one	294	” “

28137	28147	28127	28127	you	0	because”—looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella ’s smile—“I
28193	28194	28196	28196	they	756	” “
28199	28203	28196	28196	they	756	” cried Thorpe ; “
28227	28228	28218	28218	he	343	” “
28235	28236	28241	28241	he	343	” “
28264	28265	28262	28262	you	0	” “

28342	28343	28346	28346	they	763	” “
28389	28394	28395	28395	My	0	” Isabella corroborated it : “
28422	28423	28424	28424	I	0	” “
28454	28455	28507	28507	Tilney	94	” “
28465	28466	28507	28507	Tilney	94	” “
28491	28492	28494	28494	yourself	77	” “
28530	28531	28507	28507	Tilney	94	” “
28543	28544	28540	28541	Mrs. Allen	89	” “
28553	28554	28540	28541	Mrs. Allen	89	” “
28565	28579	28558	28558	you	77	” was the general cry . Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : “
28585	28589	28540	28541	Mrs. Allen	89	” said she , “
28594	28855	28591	28591	you	235	” And in two minutes they were off . Catherine ’s feelings , as she got into the carriage , were in a very unsettled state ; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure , and the hope of soon enjoying another , almost its equal in degree , however unlike in kind . She could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by her , in so readily giving up their engagement , without sending her any message of excuse . It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk ; and , in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour , she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience . To feel herself slighted by them was very painful . On the other hand , the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho , as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be , was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything . They passed briskly down Pulteney Street , and through Laura Place , without the exchange of many words . Thorpe talked to his horse , and she meditated , by turns , on broken promises and broken arches , phaetons and false hangings , Tilneys and trap - doors . As they entered Argyle Buildings , however , she was roused by this address from her companion , “
28871	28872	28858	28869	that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by	774	” “
28877	28878	28886	28886	she	774	” “
28895	28925	28886	28886	she	774	” Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother ’s arm , walking slowly down the street . She saw them both looking back at her . “
28933	28938	28930	28931	Mr. Thorpe	120	” she impatiently cried ; “
28972	29047	28961	28961	I	0	” But to what purpose did she speak ? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot ; the Tilneys , who had soon ceased to look after her , were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place , and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace . Still , however , and during the length of another street , she entreated him to stop . “
29076	29135	29073	29074	Miss Tilney	94	” But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit . Her reproaches , however , were not spared . “
29250	29518	29241	29241	you	120	” Thorpe defended himself very stoutly , declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life , and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself . Their drive , even when this subject was over , was not likely to be very agreeable . Catherine ’s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing . She listened reluctantly , and her replies were short . Blaize Castle remained her only comfort ; towards that , she still looked at intervals with pleasure ; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk , and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys , she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply — the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms , exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture , though now for many years deserted — the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow , winding vaults , by a low , grated door ; or even of having their lamp , their only lamp , extinguished by a sudden gust of wind , and of being left in total darkness . In the meanwhile , they proceeded on their journey without any mischance , and were within view of the town of Keynsham , when a halloo from Morland , who was behind them , made his friend pull up , to know what was the matter . The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , “
29607	29608	29592	29592	We	781	” “
29616	29637	29592	29592	We	781	” replied Thorpe rather angrily ; and instantly turning his horse , they were on their way back to Bath . “
29653	29659	29592	29592	We	781	” said he soon afterwards , “
29720	29721	29724	29724	he	77	” “
29728	29733	29724	29724	he	77	” said Catherine warmly , “
29744	29745	29738	29738	he	77	” “
29754	29755	29738	29738	he	77	” “
29763	29764	29738	29738	he	77	” “
29771	29772	29773	29773	Nobody	254	” “
29781	30002	30003	30003	I	0	” Thorpe then said something in the loud , incoherent way to which he had often recourse , about its being a d — — thing to be miserly ; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things , he did not know who could , which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand . Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment , she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so ; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words . As she entered the house , the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off ; that , when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe , the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her ; and on his saying no , had felt for a card , but said she had none about her , and went away . Pondering over these heart - rending tidings , Catherine walked slowly upstairs . At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “
30029	30106	30108	30108	I	0	” They all spent the evening together at Thorpe ’s . Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton . Her satisfaction , too , in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once . “
30261	30301	30253	30253	you	107	” Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered . “
30312	30316	30317	30317	You	107	” she whispered . “
30440	30498	30499	30500	Mrs. Allen	89	” And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch , which is the true heroine ’s portion ; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears . And lucky may she think herself , if she get another good night ’s rest in the course of the next three months . CHAPTER 12 “
30502	30509	30499	30500	Mrs. Allen	89	” said Catherine the next morning , “
30536	30537	30531	30531	I	0	” “
30560	31145	30554	30555	Miss Tilney	94	” Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney ’s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen ’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . To Milsom Street she was directed , and having made herself perfect in the number , hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit , explain her conduct , and be forgiven ; tripping lightly through the church - yard , and resolutely turning away her eyes , that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family , who , she had reason to believe , were in a shop hard by . She reached the house without any impediment , looked at the number , knocked at the door , and inquired for Miss Tilney . The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home , but was not quite certain . Would she be pleased to send up her name ? She gave her card . In a few minutes the servant returned , and with a look which did not quite confirm his words , said he had been mistaken , for that Miss Tilney was walked out . Catherine , with a blush of mortification , left the house . She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney was at home , and too much offended to admit her ; and as she retired down the street , could not withhold one glance at the drawing - room windows , in expectation of seeing her there , but no one appeared at them . At the bottom of the street , however , she looked back again , and then , not at a window , but issuing from the door , she saw Miss Tilney herself . She was followed by a gentleman , whom Catherine believed to be her father , and they turned up towards Edgar ’s Buildings . Catherine , in deep mortification , proceeded on her way . She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility ; but she checked the resentful sensation ; she remembered her own ignorance . She knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness , to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead , nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable . Dejected and humbled , she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night ; but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance , for she soon recollected , in the first place , that she was without any excuse for staying at home ; and , in the second , that it was a play she wanted very much to see . To the theatre accordingly they all went ; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her ; she feared that , amongst the many perfections of the family , a fondness for plays was not to be ranked ; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage , which she knew , on Isabella ’s authority , rendered everything else of the kind “
31149	31557	30554	30555	Miss Tilney	94	” She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure ; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one , observing her during the first four acts , would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her . On the beginning of the fifth , however , the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father , joining a party in the opposite box , recalled her to anxiety and distress . The stage could no longer excite genuine merriment — no longer keep her whole attention . Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box ; and , for the space of two entire scenes , did she thus watch Henry Tilney , without being once able to catch his eye . No longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play ; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes . At length , however , he did look towards her , and he bowed — but such a bow ! no smile , no continued observance attended it ; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction . Catherine was restlessly miserable ; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation . Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her ; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation — instead of proudly resolving , in conscious innocence , to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it , to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation , and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight , or flirting with somebody else — she took to herself all the shame of misconduct , or at least of its appearance , and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause . The play concluded — the curtain fell — Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat , but his father remained , and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box . She was right ; in a few minutes he appeared , and , making his way through the then thinning rows , spoke with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend . Not with such calmness was he answered by the latter : “
31648	31649	31643	31643	I	0	” “
31658	31708	31653	31653	you	94	” was Mrs. Allen ’s reply . Her assurance , however , standing sole as it did , was not thrown away ; it brought a more cordial , more natural smile into his countenance , and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve : “
31743	31744	31732	31732	you	94	” “
31827	31879	31899	31899	she	805	” Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration ? Henry Tilney at least was not . With a yet sweeter smile , he said everything that need be said of his sister ’s concern , regret , and dependence on Catherine ’s honour . “
31891	31895	31899	31899	she	805	” cried Catherine , “
31950	31951	31952	31952	I	0	” “
32063	32100	32046	32046	She	805	” Catherine ’s mind was greatly eased by this information , yet a something of solicitude remained , from which sprang the following question , thoroughly artless in itself , though rather distressing to the gentleman : “
32145	32146	32147	32147	Me	0	” “
32153	32154	32147	32147	Me	0	” “
32175	32176	32171	32171	you	97	” “
32186	32187	32194	32194	you	97	” “
32203	32397	32194	32194	you	97	” He replied by asking her to make room for him , and talking of the play . He remained with them some time , and was only too agreeable for Catherine to be contented when he went away . Before they parted , however , it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible ; and , setting aside the misery of his quitting their box , she was , upon the whole , left one of the happiest creatures in the world . While talking to each other , she had observed with some surprise that John Thorpe , who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together , was engaged in conversation with General Tilney ; and she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse . What could they have to say of her ? She feared General Tilney did not like her appearance : she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter , rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes . “
32407	32515	32400	32401	Mr. Thorpe	120	” was her anxious inquiry , as she pointed them out to her companion . He knew nothing about it ; but his father , like every military man , had a very large acquaintance . When the entertainment was over , Thorpe came to assist them in getting out . Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry ; and , while they waited in the lobby for a chair , he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue , by asking , in a consequential manner , whether she had seen him talking with General Tilney : “
32563	32564	32546	32546	I	0	” “
32573	32574	32568	32568	you	0	” “
32760	32761	32750	32751	the General	2215	” “
32772	32773	32750	32751	the General	2215	” “
32780	32782	32785	32785	General	830	said?”—lowering his voice—“well
32797	33276	32788	32788	I	0	” Here Catherine , who was much less gratified by his admiration than by General Tilney ’s , was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen . Thorpe , however , would see her to her chair , and , till she entered it , continued the same kind of delicate flattery , in spite of her entreating him to have done . That General Tilney , instead of disliking , should admire her , was very delightful ; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet . The evening had done more , much more , for her than could have been expected . CHAPTER 13 Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , and Saturday have now passed in review before the reader ; the events of each day , its hopes and fears , mortifications and pleasures , have been separately stated , and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described , and close the week . The Clifton scheme had been deferred , not relinquished , and on the afternoon ’s Crescent of this day , it was brought forward again . In a private consultation between Isabella and James , the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going , and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her , it was agreed that , provided the weather were fair , the party should take place on the following morning ; and they were to set off very early , in order to be at home in good time . The affair thus determined , and Thorpe ’s approbation secured , Catherine only remained to be apprised of it . She had left them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney . In that interval the plan was completed , and as soon as she came again , her agreement was demanded ; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella , Catherine looked grave , was very sorry , but could not go . The engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now . She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk to - morrow ; it was quite determined , and she would not , upon any account , retract . But that she must and should retract , was instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes ; they must go to Clifton to - morrow , they would not go without her , it would be nothing to put off a mere walk for one day longer , and they would not hear of a refusal . Catherine was distressed , but not subdued . “
33296	33325	33291	33291	I	0	” This availed nothing . The same arguments assailed her again ; she must go , she should go , and they would not hear of a refusal . “
33358	33359	33282	33282	Isabella	105	” “
33381	33541	33542	33542	I	0	” But Isabella became only more and more urgent , calling on her in the most affectionate manner , addressing her by the most endearing names . She was sure her dearest , sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly . She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart , so sweet a temper , to be so easily persuaded by those she loved . But all in vain ; Catherine felt herself to be in the right , and though pained by such tender , such flattering supplication , could not allow it to influence her . Isabella then tried another method . She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney , though she had known her so little a while , than for her best and oldest friends , with being grown cold and indifferent , in short , towards herself . “
33638	33722	33629	33630	These Tilneys	133	” Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind . Was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others ? Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish , regardless of everything but her own gratification . These painful ideas crossed her mind , though she said nothing . Isabella , in the meanwhile , had applied her handkerchief to her eyes ; and Morland , miserable at such a sight , could not help saying , “
33763	33828	33751	33751	I	0	” This was the first time of her brother ’s openly siding against her , and anxious to avoid his displeasure , she proposed a compromise . If they would only put off their scheme till Tuesday , which they might easily do , as it depended only on themselves , she could go with them , and everybody might then be satisfied . But “
33835	33841	33751	33751	I	0	” was the immediate answer ; “
33862	33894	33848	33848	Thorpe	105	” Catherine was sorry , but could do no more ; and a short silence ensued , which was broken by Isabella , who in a voice of cold resentment said , “
33942	33943	33944	33944	Catherine	77	” “
33950	33954	33944	33944	Catherine	77	” said James . “
33979	33980	33968	33968	I	0	” “
33984	33988	33968	33968	I	0	” cried Thorpe , “
34034	34035	34024	34024	I	0	” “
34046	34130	34024	34024	I	0	” But her words were lost on Thorpe , who had turned abruptly away . The three others still continued together , walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine ; sometimes not a word was said , sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches , and her arm was still linked within Isabella ’s , though their hearts were at war . At one moment she was softened , at another irritated ; always distressed , but always steady . “
34143	34147	34141	34141	Catherine	77	” said James ; “
34172	34173	34159	34159	you	77	” “
34183	34190	34159	34159	you	77	” she replied , very feelingly ; “
34213	34214	34215	34215	I	0	” “
34218	34227	34215	34215	I	0	” said Isabella , in a low voice , “
34234	34279	34215	34215	I	0	” Catherine ’s heart swelled ; she drew away her arm , and Isabella made no opposition . Thus passed a long ten minutes , till they were again joined by Thorpe , who , coming to them with a gayer look , said , “
34314	34315	34316	34316	You	0	” “
34320	34324	34325	34325	I	0	” cried Catherine . “
34408	34428	34404	34404	mine	0	” Isabella ’s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour , and James too looked happy again . “
34461	34462	34456	34459	a most delightful party	849	” “
34468	34472	34473	34473	I	0	” said Catherine ; “
34492	34554	34480	34480	I	0	” Isabella , however , caught hold of one hand , Thorpe of the other , and remonstrances poured in from all three . Even James was quite angry . When everything was settled , when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well , it was quite ridiculous , quite absurd , to make any further objection . “
34646	34684	34639	34639	Isabella	105	” Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys ; they were turning the corner into Brock Street , when he had overtaken them , and were at home by this time . “
34692	34696	34686	34686	I	0	” said Catherine ; “
34733	34757	34773	34773	She	851	” And with these words she broke away and hurried off . Thorpe would have darted after her , but Morland withheld him . “
34771	34772	34773	34773	She	851	” “
34779	35148	34773	34773	She	851	” Thorpe never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere . As she walked , she reflected on what had passed . It was painful to her to disappoint and displease them , particularly to displease her brother ; but she could not repent her resistance . Setting her own inclination apart , to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney , to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before , and on a false pretence too , must have been wrong . She had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone , she had not consulted merely her own gratification ; that might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself , by seeing Blaize Castle ; no , she had attended to what was due to others , and to her own character in their opinion . Her conviction of being right , however , was not enough to restore her composure ; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not be at ease ; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent , she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of Milsom Street . So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the Tilneys ’ advantage in the outset , they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them ; and the servant still remaining at the open door , she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment , and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs . Then , opening the first door before her , which happened to be the right , she immediately found herself in the drawing - room with General Tilney , his son , and daughter . Her explanation , defective only in being — from her irritation of nerves and shortness of breath — no explanation at all , was instantly given . “
35203	35403	35192	35192	you	853	” The business , however , though not perfectly elucidated by this speech , soon ceased to be a puzzle . Catherine found that John Thorpe had given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it . But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing . Whatever might have been felt before her arrival , her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire . The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on . To such anxious attention was the General ’s civility carried , that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house , he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself . “
35422	35585	35411	35411	He	104	” And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity . After sitting with them a quarter of an hour , she rose to take leave , and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney ’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her . Miss Tilney added her own wishes . Catherine was greatly obliged ; but it was quite out of her power . Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment . The General declared he could say no more ; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded ; but on some other day he trusted , when longer notice could be given , they would not refuse to spare her to her friend . “
35610	35853	35602	35602	she	856	” The General attended her himself to the street - door , saying everything gallant as they went downstairs , admiring the elasticity of her walk , which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing , and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld , when they parted . Catherine , delighted by all that had passed , proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street , walking , as she concluded , with great elasticity , though she had never thought of it before . She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party ; and now that she had been triumphant throughout , had carried her point , and was secure of her walk , she began ( as the flutter of her spirits subsided ) to doubt whether she had been perfectly right . A sacrifice was always noble ; and if she had given way to their entreaties , she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased , a brother angry , and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed , perhaps through her means . To ease her mind , and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been , she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half - settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day . Mr. Allen caught at it directly . “
35856	35860	35602	35602	she	856	” said he , “
35869	35870	35863	35863	you	857	” “
35904	35905	35902	35902	I	0	” “
36016	36017	36008	36008	you	857	” “
36072	36073	36076	36076	you	857	” “
36117	36118	36088	36088	you	857	” “
36138	36139	36130	36130	I	0	” “
36143	36147	36130	36130	I	0	” cried Catherine , “
36198	36199	36185	36185	you	870	” “
36289	36290	36279	36280	Young people	467	” “
36313	36314	36304	36304	you	870	” “
36329	36334	36304	36304	you	870	” said Mr. Allen ; “
36355	36356	36336	36336	I	0	” “
36367	36460	36361	36361	I	0	” added his wife . Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed . Mr. Allen , however , discouraged her from doing any such thing . “
36529	36788	36789	36789	I	0	” Catherine submitted , and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong , felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen ’s approbation of her own conduct , and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself . Her escape from being one of the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed ; for what would the Tilneys have thought of her , if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself , if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety , only to enable her to be guilty of another ? CHAPTER 14 The next morning was fair , and Catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party . With Mr. Allen to support her , she felt no dread of the event : but she would gladly be spared a contest , where victory itself was painful , and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them . The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time ; and no new difficulty arising , no sudden recollection , no unexpected summons , no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures , my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement , though it was made with the hero himself . They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff , that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in Bath . “
36795	36809	36789	36789	I	0	” said Catherine , as they walked along the side of the river , “
36818	36819	36820	36820	You	883	” “
36826	36834	36820	36820	You	883	” said Henry , a little surprised . “

37905	37910	37902	37902	you	97	” said Miss Tilney , “
38058	38059	38060	38060	You	97	” “
38206	38207	38187	38187	I	0	” “
38217	38221	38187	38187	I	0	” said Henry , “
38327	38328	38329	38329	You	929	” “
38427	38428	38410	38410	you	929	” “
38532	39172	38515	38516	Mrs. Radcliffe	123	” Catherine assented — and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady ’s merits closed the subject . The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say . They were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing , and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures , with all the eagerness of real taste . Here Catherine was quite lost . She knew nothing of drawing — nothing of taste : and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit , for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her . The little which she could understand , however , appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before . It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill , and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day . She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance . A misplaced shame . Where people wish to attach , they should always be ignorant . To come with a well - informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others , which a sensible person would always wish to avoid . A woman especially , if she have the misfortune of knowing anything , should conceal it as well as she can . The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author ; and to her treatment of the subject I will only add , in justice to men , that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex , imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms , there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance . But Catherine did not know her own advantages — did not know that a good - looking girl , with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind , can not fail of attracting a clever young man , unless circumstances are particularly untoward . In the present instance , she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge , declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw ; and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed , in which his instructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in everything admired by him , and her attention was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste . He talked of foregrounds , distances , and second distances — side - screens and perspectives — lights and shades ; and Catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff , she voluntarily rejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape . Delighted with her progress , and fearful of wearying her with too much wisdom at once , Henry suffered the subject to decline , and by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near its summit , to oaks in general , to forests , the enclosure of them , waste lands , crown lands and government , he shortly found himself arrived at politics ; and from politics , it was an easy step to silence . The general pause which succeeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine , who , in rather a solemn tone of voice , uttered these words , “
39188	39206	39254	39254	you	0	” Miss Tilney , to whom this was chiefly addressed , was startled , and hastily replied , “
39214	39215	39217	39217	I	0	” “
39247	39248	39228	39228	I	0	” “
39261	39262	39254	39254	you	0	” “
39297	39298	39299	39299	You	0	” “
39340	39341	39332	39332	government	939	” “
39344	39353	39332	39332	government	939	” said Henry , endeavouring not to smile , “
39376	39387	39391	39391	I	0	” The ladies stared . He laughed , and added , “
39494	39495	39496	39497	Miss Morland	88	” “
39519	39520	39503	39503	he	0	” “
39526	39527	39528	39528	My	0	” “
39766	39771	39756	39756	she	88	” Catherine looked grave . “
39777	39782	39792	39792	you	97	” said Miss Tilney , “
39838	39839	39828	39829	Miss Morland	88	” “
39853	39854	39840	39840	I	0	” “
39867	39868	39840	39840	I	0	” “
39875	39876	39877	39877	You	97	” “
39905	39906	39895	39895	you	97	” “
39943	39944	39910	39910	I	0	” “
39954	39955	39956	39957	Miss Morland	88	” “
39996	39997	39998	39998	We	971	” “
40054	40359	40032	40032	he	0	” It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never be wrong . His manner might sometimes surprise , but his meaning must always be just : and what she did not understand , she was almost as ready to admire , as what she did . The whole walk was delightful , and though it ended too soon , its conclusion was delightful too ; her friends attended her into the house , and Miss Tilney , before they parted , addressing herself with respectful form , as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine , petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next . No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen ’s side , and the only difficulty on Catherine ’s was in concealing the excess of her pleasure . The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection , for no thought of Isabella or James had crossed her during their walk . When the Tilneys were gone , she became amiable again , but she was amiable for some time to little effect ; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety ; she had heard nothing of any of them . Towards the end of the morning , however , Catherine , having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment ’s delay , walked out into the town , and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she was loitering towards Edgar ’s Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world , who had been her dear friends all the morning . From her , she soon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place . “
40368	40373	40360	40360	They	973	” said Miss Anne , “
40437	40453	40433	40433	John	101	” Catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement . “
40458	40463	40433	40433	John	101	” rejoined the other , “
40516	40530	40531	40531	I	0	” Catherine , a little doubtful of this , could not help answering , “
40549	40550	40552	40552	you	974	” “
40589	40998	40583	40583	Sophia	157	” Catherine was still unconvinced ; but glad that Anne should have the friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her , she bade her adieu without much uneasiness , and returned home , pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it , and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to resent her resistance any longer . CHAPTER 15 Early the next day , a note from Isabella , speaking peace and tenderness in every line , and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance , hastened Catherine , in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity , to Edgar ’s Buildings . The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour ; and , on Anne ’s quitting it to call her sister , Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday ’s party . Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it ; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world , that nobody could imagine how charming it had been , and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive . Such was the information of the first five minutes ; the second unfolded thus much in detail — that they had driven directly to the York Hotel , ate some soup , and bespoke an early dinner , walked down to the pump - room , tasted the water , and laid out some shillings in purses and spars ; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry - cook ’s , and hurrying back to the hotel , swallowed their dinner in haste , to prevent being in the dark ; and then had a delightful drive back , only the moon was not up , and it rained a little , and Mr. Morland ’s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along . Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction . It appeared that Blaize Castle had never been thought of ; and , as for all the rest , there was nothing to regret for half an instant . Maria ’s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne , whom she represented as insupportably cross , from being excluded the party . “
41079	41123	41148	41148	yours	77	” Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step , and a look of such happy importance , as engaged all her friend ’s notice . Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : “
41155	41166	41148	41148	yours	77	” Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance . “
41175	41180	41182	41182	yourself	77	” continued the other , “
41283	41318	41278	41278	I	0	” Catherine ’s understanding began to awake : an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind ; and , with the natural blush of so new an emotion , she cried out , “
41343	41543	41544	41544	You	994	” This bold surmise , however , she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact . The anxious affection , which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella ’s every look and action , had , in the course of their yesterday ’s party , received the delightful confession of an equal love . Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James . Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest , wonder , and joy . Her brother and her friend engaged ! new to such circumstances , the importance of it appeared unspeakably great , and she contemplated it as one of those grand events , of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return . The strength of her feelings she could not express ; the nature of them , however , contented her friend . The happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion , and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy . Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did , in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations . “
41583	41593	41594	41594	You	994	” This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine . “
41602	41606	41598	41600	your dear brother	997	” continued Isabella , “
41701	41737	41738	41738	I	0	” Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love ; for , though exceedingly fond of her brother , and partial to all his endowments , she had never in her life thought him handsome . “
41879	41991	41869	41869	I	0	” Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer ; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected , she dared no longer contest the point , nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her . Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella . Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son ’s wishes . “
41996	42000	42002	42002	parents	1006	” said she , “
42026	42027	42028	42028	Morland	77	” “
42034	42038	42028	42028	Morland	77	” replied Isabella ; “
42069	42079	42061	42062	Your brother	463	” Here Catherine again discerned the force of love . “
42099	42100	42105	42105	Catherine	77	” “
42166	42209	42210	42210	I	0	” This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea . “
42217	42223	42210	42210	I	0	” was her frequent declaration ; “
42234	42235	42227	42227	they	1015	” “
42241	42245	42227	42227	they	1015	” said Isabella , “
42307	42308	42322	42322	You	77	” “
42311	42315	42322	42322	You	77	” cried Catherine . “
42328	42329	42322	42322	You	77	” “
42426	42586	42416	42416	I	0	” A reverie succeeded this conviction — and when Isabella spoke again , it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding - gown . Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself , who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire . Catherine wished to congratulate him , but knew not what to say , and her eloquence was only in her eyes . From them , however , the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively , and James could combine them with ease . Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home , his adieus were not long ; and they would have been yet shorter , had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go . Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone . “
42636	42791	42631	42631	I	0	” The two friends , with hearts now more united than ever , were inseparable for the day ; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along . Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland ’s consent , to consider Isabella ’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters . To Catherine ’s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their “
42795	42916	42917	42917	I	0	” ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute . Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress . But when it did come , where could distress be found ? “
42947	43040	43042	43042	John	101	” were the first three lines , and in one moment all was joyful security . The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella ’s features , all care and anxiety seemed removed , her spirits became almost too high for control , and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals . Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction . Her heart was overflowing with tenderness . It was “
43043	43045	43047	43047	Catherine	77	” and “
43048	43053	43054	43055	dear Anne	155	” at every word ; “
43059	43071	43047	43047	Catherine	77	” must immediately be made sharers in their felicity ; and two “
43073	43341	43042	43042	John	101	” at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned . John himself was no skulker in joy . He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world , but swore off many sentences in his praise . The letter , whence sprang all this felicity , was short , containing little more than this assurance of success ; and every particular was deferred till James could write again . But for particulars Isabella could well afford to wait . The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland ’s promise ; his honour was pledged to make everything easy ; and by what means their income was to be formed , whether landed property were to be resigned , or funded money made over , was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern . She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities . She saw herself at the end of a few weeks , the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton , the envy of every valued old friend in Putney , with a carriage at her command , a new name on her tickets , and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger . When the contents of the letter were ascertained , John Thorpe , who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London , prepared to set off . “
43347	43359	43344	43345	Miss Morland	88	” said he , on finding her alone in the parlour , “
43370	43404	43360	43360	I	0	” Catherine wished him a good journey . Without appearing to hear her , he walked to the window , fidgeted about , hummed a tune , and seemed wholly self - occupied . “
43413	43432	43407	43407	you	0	” said Catherine . He made no answer ; but after a minute ’s silence burst out with , “
43473	43474	43465	43465	I	0	” “
43486	43487	43489	43489	you	0	” “
43542	43543	43528	43528	I	0	” “
43559	43560	43546	43546	I	0	” “
43564	43571	43563	43563	you	0	know”—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh—“I
43589	43590	43592	43592	we	1026	” “
43624	43625	43608	43608	I	0	” “
43671	43672	43648	43648	I	0	” “
43682	43694	43676	43676	you	0	” replied Catherine — finding that he waited for an answer . “
43779	43780	43763	43763	you	0	” “
43809	43810	43812	43812	I	0	” “
43836	43837	43812	43812	I	0	” “
43853	43854	43844	43844	mother	193	” “
43874	43875	43865	43865	you	0	” “
43900	43901	43895	43895	Company	1032	” “
43984	43985	43987	43987	we	1035	” “
44023	44024	44026	44026	Jove	134	” “
44115	44116	44102	44102	she	1037	” “
44204	44791	44188	44188	We	1039	” And away she went . It was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer . With such news to communicate , and such a visit to prepare for , her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge ; and she hurried away , leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address , and her explicit encouragement . The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother ’s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen , by the communication of the wonderful event . How great was her disappointment ! the important affair , which many words of preparation ushered in , had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother ’s arrival ; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people ’s happiness , with a remark , on the gentleman ’s side , in favour of Isabella ’s beauty , and on the lady ’s , of her great good luck . It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility . The disclosure , however , of the great secret of James ’s going to Fullerton the day before , did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen . She could not listen to that with perfect calmness , but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment , wished she could have known his intention , wished she could have seen him before he went , as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother , and her kind compliments to all the Skinners . CHAPTER 16 Catherine ’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable ; and accordingly , though she was most politely received by General Tilney , and kindly welcomed by his daughter , though Henry was at home , and no one else of the party , she found , on her return , without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings , that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded . Instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney , from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him . It puzzled her to account for all this . It could not be General Tilney ’s fault . That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father . He could not be accountable for his children ’s want of spirits , or for her want of enjoyment in his company . The former she hoped at last might have been accidental , and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity . Isabella , on hearing the particulars of the visit , gave a different explanation : “
44867	44868	44878	44878	Isabella	105	” “
44890	44891	44885	44885	she	1040	” “
44938	44939	44928	44928	he	1044	” “
44955	44956	44947	44947	he	1044	” “
44993	44994	44987	44987	he	1044	” “
45007	45008	45001	45001	he	1044	” “
45046	45047	45039	45039	John	101	” “
45087	45088	45077	45077	his	1044	” “
45129	45130	45125	45125	John	101	” “
45152	45153	45133	45133	I	0	” “
45159	45160	45133	45133	I	0	” “
45174	45175	45167	45167	I	0	” “
45289	45864	45865	45865	Your	1054	” Isabella ’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend ; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister ; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts . The evening rewarded her confidence ; she was met by one with the same kindness , and by the other with the same attention , as heretofore : Miss Tilney took pains to be near her , and Henry asked her to dance . Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother , Captain Tilney , was expected almost every hour , she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable - looking , handsome young man , whom she had never seen before , and who now evidently belonged to their party . She looked at him with great admiration , and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother , though , in her eyes , his air was more assuming , and his countenance less prepossessing . His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior ; for , within her hearing , he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself , but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible . From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that , whatever might be our heroine ’s opinion of him , his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind ; not likely to produce animosities between the brothers , nor persecutions to the lady . He can not be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen ’s greatcoats , by whom she will hereafter be forced into a traveling - chaise and four , which will drive off with incredible speed . Catherine , meanwhile , undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil , or of any evil at all , except that of having but a short set to dance down , enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney , listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said ; and , in finding him irresistible , becoming so herself . At the end of the first dance , Captain Tilney came towards them again , and , much to Catherine ’s dissatisfaction , pulled his brother away . They retired whispering together ; and , though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm , and lay it down as fact , that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her , which he now hastened to communicate to his brother , in the hope of separating them forever , she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations . Her suspense was of full five minutes ’ duration ; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour , when they both returned , and an explanation was given , by Henry ’s requesting to know , if she thought her friend , Miss Thorpe , would have any objection to dancing , as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her . Catherine , without hesitation , replied that she was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all . The cruel reply was passed on to the other , and he immediately walked away . “
45875	45879	45865	45866	Your brother	463	” said she , “
45940	45947	45923	45923	he	463	” Henry smiled , and said , “
45966	45967	45972	45972	you	1054	” “
45975	45976	45972	45972	you	1054	” “

46201	46335	46336	46336	I	0	” Catherine blushed and disclaimed , and the gentleman ’s predictions were verified . There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across . Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled , the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given ; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine ’s comprehension , she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner . “
46353	46354	46345	46345	isabella	105	” “
46364	46365	46360	46360	her	105	” “

46493	46494	46486	46486	Isabella	105	” “
46553	46591	46592	46592	I	0	” The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “
46635	46636	46625	46625	I	0	” “
46643	46644	46641	46641	you	0	” “
46884	46885	46876	46876	I	0	” “
46892	46893	46900	46900	he	405	” “
46965	47164	46951	46951	I	0	” When the young ladies next met , they had a far more interesting subject to discuss . James Morland ’s second letter was then received , and the kind intentions of his father fully explained . A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children . An estate of at least equal value , moreover , was assured as his future inheritance . James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude ; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry , being , however unwelcome , no more than he had expected , was borne by him without discontent . Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled . “
47171	47180	46951	46951	I	0	” said Isabella , with a grave face . “
47189	47202	47203	47203	I	0	” said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe , looking anxiously at her daughter . “
47291	47292	47278	47278	you	1084	” “
47352	47353	47354	47354	I	0	” “
47493	47494	47483	47483	he	107	” “
47534	47542	47543	47543	I	0	” Catherine was hurt by these insinuations . “
47548	47552	47543	47543	I	0	” said she , “
47567	47572	47563	47563	he	616	” Isabella recollected herself . “
47692	47693	47700	47700	Isabella	105	” “
47702	47707	47700	47700	Isabella	105	” said Mrs. Thorpe , “
47741	47956	47728	47728	everybody	1776	” Catherine ’s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen . She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella ’s regret ; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever , endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise . James soon followed his letter , and was received with the most gratifying kindness . CHAPTER 17 The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath ; and whether it should be the last was for some time a question , to which Catherine listened with a beating heart . To have her acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance . Her whole happiness seemed at stake , while the affair was in suspense , and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight . What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine ’s speculation . Once or twice indeed , since James ’s engagement had taught her what could be done , she had got so far as to indulge in a secret “
47959	48123	47728	47728	everybody	1776	” but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views : the present was now comprised in another three weeks , and her happiness being certain for that period , the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest . In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged , she visited Miss Tilney , and poured forth her joyful feelings . It was doomed to be a day of trial . No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow ! the past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment . Catherine ’s countenance fell , and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney ’s concluding words , “
48131	48132	47728	47728	everybody	1776	” “
48185	48186	48187	48187	I	0	” “
48194	48199	48187	48187	I	0	” said Catherine dejectedly ; “
48207	48208	48201	48201	I	0	” “
48211	48220	48187	48187	I	0	” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “
48235	48278	48221	48221	you	0	” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding . After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “
48298	48299	48284	48284	I	0	” “
48316	48317	48300	48300	I	0	” “
48341	48353	48335	48336	My daughter	1113	” he continued , without leaving his daughter time to speak , “
48593	48685	48686	48686	I	0	” Northanger Abbey ! these were thrilling words , and wound up Catherine ’s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy . Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness . To receive so flattering an invitation ! to have her company so warmly solicited ! everything honourable and soothing , every present enjoyment , and every future hope was contained in it ; and her acceptance , with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma ’s approbation , was eagerly given . “
48692	48696	48686	48686	I	0	” said she , “
48712	48739	48708	48708	they	1125	” General Tilney was not less sanguine , having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street , and obtained their sanction of his wishes . “
48749	48753	48708	48708	they	1125	” said he , “
48763	49561	48708	48708	they	1125	” Miss Tilney was earnest , though gentle , in her secondary civilities , and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would allow . The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine ’s feelings through the varieties of suspense , security , and disappointment ; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss ; and with spirits elated to rapture , with Henry at her heart , and Northanger Abbey on her lips , she hurried home to write her letter . Mr. and Mrs. Morland , relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their daughter , felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye , and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire . This indulgence , though not more than Catherine had hoped for , completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature , in friends and fortune , circumstance and chance . Everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage . By the kindness of her first friends , the Allens , she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her . Her feelings , her preferences , had each known the happiness of a return . Wherever she felt attachment , she had been able to create it . The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister . The Tilneys , they , by whom , above all , she desired to be favourably thought of , outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued . She was to be their chosen visitor , she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized — and , in addition to all the rest , this roof was to be the roof of an abbey ! her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney — and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill . To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one , or the cloisters of the other , had been for many weeks a darling wish , though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire . And yet , this was to happen . With all the chances against her of house , hall , place , park , court , and cottage , Northanger turned up an abbey , and she was to be its inhabitant . Its long , damp passages , its narrow cells and ruined chapel , were to be within her daily reach , and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends , some awful memorials of an injured and ill - fated nun . It was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home , that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne . The power of early habit only could account for it . A distinction to which they had been born gave no pride . Their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person . Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney ; but so active were her thoughts , that when these inquiries were answered , she was hardly more assured than before , of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation , of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution , of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed , or of its standing low in a valley , sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak . CHAPTER 18 With a mind thus full of happiness , Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away , without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together . She began first to be sensible of this , and to sigh for her conversation , as she walked along the pump - room one morning , by Mrs. Allen ’s side , without anything to say or to hear ; and scarcely had she felt a five minutes ’ longing of friendship , before the object of it appeared , and inviting her to a secret conference , led the way to a seat . “
49568	49593	48708	48708	they	1125	” said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors , which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either ; “
49602	49654	48708	48708	they	1125	” Catherine , observing that Isabella ’s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other , as in eager expectation , and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch , thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so ; and therefore gaily said , “
49668	49669	49662	49662	James	107	” “
49676	49680	49662	49662	James	107	” she replied , “
49758	49759	49760	49760	You	105	” “
49784	49785	49786	49786	I	0	” “
49853	49854	49839	49839	Tilney	94	” “
49870	49871	49861	49861	you	105	” “
49923	49924	49915	49915	John	101	” “

50119	50166	50195	50195	his	101	” Catherine , with all the earnestness of truth , expressed her astonishment at such a charge , protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe ’s being in love with her , and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him . “
50295	50296	50299	50299	you	0	” “
50346	50347	50349	50349	you	0	” “
50570	50575	50564	50564	he	1150	” Isabella was silent . “
50612	50613	50634	50634	sisters	1855	” “
50617	50624	50634	50634	sisters	1855	” ( with a blush ) , “
50667	50668	50669	50669	I	0	” “
50686	50687	50669	50669	I	0	” “
50822	50823	50824	50824	You	105	” “
50855	50856	50833	50833	wrong?—You	105	” “
50863	50868	50833	50833	wrong?—You	105	” answered Isabella laughingly , “
50975	50976	50993	50993	You	105	” “
51000	51001	50993	50993	You	105	” “
51006	51017	51018	51018	I	0	” continued the other without at all listening to her , “
51227	51285	51217	51217	he	94	” Catherine , looking up , perceived Captain Tilney ; and Isabella , earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke , soon caught his notice . He approached immediately , and took the seat to which her movements invited him . His first address made Catherine start . Though spoken low , she could distinguish , “
51299	51300	51217	51217	he	94	” “
51305	51316	51217	51217	he	94	” was Isabella ’s answer in the same half whisper . “
51343	51344	51345	51345	I	0	” “
51359	51360	51361	51361	My	0	” “
51384	51385	51375	51375	You	0	” “
51403	51404	51406	51406	they	1179	” “
51436	51445	51446	51446	I	0	” ( turning her back on him ) ; “
51455	51456	51446	51446	I	0	” “
51481	52475	52476	52476	My	0	” Catherine heard all this , and quite out of countenance , could listen no longer . Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking . But for this Isabella showed no inclination . She was so amazingly tired , and it was so odious to parade about the pump - room ; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters ; she was expecting her sisters every moment ; so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her , and must sit quietly down again . But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney . With much uneasiness did she thus leave them . It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement . To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible ; and yet , during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd . She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney . How strange that she should not perceive his admiration ! catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother . The compliment of John Thorpe ’s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister . She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious . In vanity , therefore , she gained but little ; her chief profit was in wonder . That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment . Isabella talked of his attentions ; she had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and would never be said again ; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort . CHAPTER 19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely . The result of her observations was not agreeable . Isabella seemed an altered creature . When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar ’s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed . A something of languid indifference , or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before , would occasionally come across her ; but had nothing worse appeared , that might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest . But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over . What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at , was beyond her comprehension . Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent . James was the sufferer . She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart , to her it was always an object . For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned . Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment ; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it . He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension . She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her . If able to suggest a hint , Isabella could never understand it . In this distress , the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney ’s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own . But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing ; he was not to be of the party to Northanger ; he was to continue at Bath . When Catherine knew this , her resolution was directly made . She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement . “
52482	52488	52490	52490	he	405	” was Henry ’s answer . “
52499	52519	52523	52523	you	1181	” He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “
52590	52596	52597	52597	I	0	” Henry smiled and said , “
52609	52610	52597	52597	I	0	” “
52620	52621	52612	52612	you	1181	” “
52667	52668	52653	52653	He	405	” “
52680	52684	52685	52685	he	405	” cried Catherine ; “
52715	52716	52710	52710	he	405	” “
52728	52729	52719	52719	you	0	” “

52807	52817	52818	52818	Isabella	105	” Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , “
52882	52883	52884	52884	I	0	” “
52899	52900	52887	52887	she	105	” “

52954	52964	52945	52946	The gentlemen	243	” After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , “
52979	52980	52981	52981	I	0	” “
52990	52991	52981	52981	I	0	” “

53176	53177	53174	53174	her	896	” “
53180	53190	53174	53174	her	896	” said Catherine , after some moments ’ consideration , “
53248	53249	53250	53250	My	0	” “
53255	53259	53250	53250	My	0	” said Henry , “
53494	53507	53509	53509	Frederick	78	” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “
53587	54317	53572	53572	she	105	” Catherine would contend no longer against comfort . She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech , but it now carried her captive . Henry Tilney must know best . She blamed herself for the extent of her fears , and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again . Her resolution was supported by Isabella ’s behaviour in their parting interview . The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine ’s stay in Pulteney Street , and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness , or make her quit them in apprehension . James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid . Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry ’s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection . The embraces , tears , and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied . CHAPTER 20 Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend , whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion , and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased . Her happiness in going with Miss Tilney , however , prevented their wishing it otherwise ; and , as they were to remain only one more week in Bath themselves , her quitting them now would not long be felt . Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion , that , in the embarrassment of the first five minutes , she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney Street . Miss Tilney ’s manners and Henry ’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings ; but still she was far from being at ease ; nor could the incessant attentions of the General himself entirely reassure her . Nay , perverse as it seemed , she doubted whether she might not have felt less , had she been less attended to . His anxiety for her comfort — his continual solicitations that she would eat , and his often - expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste — though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast - table — made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor . She felt utterly unworthy of such respect , and knew not how to reply to it . Her tranquillity was not improved by the General ’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son , nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down . She was quite pained by the severity of his father ’s reproof , which seemed disproportionate to the offence ; and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture , and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her . This was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation , and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney , without being able to hope for his goodwill . He listened to his father in silence , and attempted not any defence , which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind , on Isabella ’s account , might , by keeping him long sleepless , have been the real cause of his rising late . It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “
54329	54803	54810	54810	he	1226	” The bustle of going was not pleasant . The clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down , and the General had fixed to be out of Milsom Street by that hour . His greatcoat , instead of being brought for him to put on directly , was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son . The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out , though there were three people to go in it , and his daughter ’s maid had so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit ; and , so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in , that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing - desk from being thrown out into the street . At last , however , the door was closed upon the three females , and they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome , highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles : such was the distance of Northanger from Bath , to be now divided into two equal stages . Catherine ’s spirits revived as they drove from the door ; for with Miss Tilney she felt no restraint ; and , with the interest of a road entirely new to her , of an abbey before , and a curricle behind , she caught the last view of Bath without any regret , and met with every milestone before she expected it . The tediousness of a two hours ’ wait at Petty France , in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry , and loiter about without anything to see , next followed — and her admiration of the style in which they travelled , of the fashionable chaise and four — postilions handsomely liveried , rising so regularly in their stirrups , and numerous outriders properly mounted , sunk a little under this consequent inconvenience . Had their party been perfectly agreeable , the delay would have been nothing ; but General Tilney , though so charming a man , seemed always a check upon his children ’s spirits , and scarcely anything was said but by himself ; the observation of which , with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded , and his angry impatience at the waiters , made Catherine grow every moment more in awe of him , and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four . At last , however , the order of release was given ; and much was Catherine then surprised by the General ’s proposal of her taking his place in his son ’s curricle for the rest of the journey : “
54824	55200	54810	54810	he	1226	” The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France . Half the time would have been enough for the curricle , and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move , that , had not the General chosen to have his own carriage lead the way , they could have passed it with ease in half a minute . But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses ; Henry drove so well — so quietly — without making any disturbance , without parading to her , or swearing at them : so different from the only gentleman - coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with ! and then his hat sat so well , and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat looked so becomingly important ! to be driven by him , next to being dancing with him , was certainly the greatest happiness in the world . In addition to every other delight , she had now that of listening to her own praise ; of being thanked at least , on his sister ’s account , for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor ; of hearing it ranked as real friendship , and described as creating real gratitude . His sister , he said , was uncomfortably circumstanced — she had no female companion — and , in the frequent absence of her father , was sometimes without any companion at all . “
55207	55211	54810	54810	he	1226	” said Catherine . “
55218	55219	54810	54810	he	1226	” “

55270	55271	55272	55272	I	0	” “
55280	55281	55278	55278	Eleanor	142	” “
55321	55328	55329	55329	You	1229	” He smiled , and said , “

55364	55365	55346	55346	I	0	” “

56197	56198	56185	56185	I	0	” “
56498	56499	56607	56607	she	1273	” “
56516	56603	56604	56605	Miss Tilney	94	” But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther ; he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice , and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda ’s woes . Catherine , recollecting herself , grew ashamed of her eagerness , and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related . “
56631	57676	56624	56624	she	1273	” As they drew near the end of their journey , her impatience for a sight of the abbey — for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different — returned in full force , and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone , rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks , with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows . But so low did the building stand , that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger , without having discerned even an antique chimney . She knew not that she had any right to be surprised , but there was a something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected . To pass between lodges of a modern appearance , to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey , and driven so rapidly along a smooth , level road of fine gravel , without obstacle , alarm , or solemnity of any kind , struck her as odd and inconsistent . She was not long at leisure , however , for such considerations . A sudden scud of rain , driving full in her face , made it impossible for her to observe anything further , and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet ; and she was actually under the abbey walls , was springing , with Henry ’s assistance , from the carriage , was beneath the shelter of the old porch , and had even passed on to the hall , where her friend and the General were waiting to welcome her , without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself , or one moment ’s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice . The breeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her ; it had wafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain ; and having given a good shake to her habit , she was ready to be shown into the common drawing - room , and capable of considering where she was . An abbey ! yes , it was delightful to be really in an abbey ! but she doubted , as she looked round the room , whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness . The furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste . The fireplace , where she had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times , was contracted to a Rumford , with slabs of plain though handsome marble , and ornaments over it of the prettiest English china . The windows , to which she looked with peculiar dependence , from having heard the General talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care , were yet less what her fancy had portrayed . To be sure , the pointed arch was preserved — the form of them was Gothic — they might be even casements — but every pane was so large , so clear , so light ! to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions , and the heaviest stone - work , for painted glass , dirt , and cobwebs , the difference was very distressing . The General , perceiving how her eye was employed , began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture , where everything , being for daily use , pretended only to comfort , etc . ; flattering himself , however , that there were some apartments in the Abbey not unworthy her notice — and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular , when , taking out his watch , he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five ! this seemed the word of separation , and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss Tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at Northanger . Returning through the large and lofty hall , they ascended a broad staircase of shining oak , which , after many flights and many landing - places , brought them upon a long , wide gallery . On one side it had a range of doors , and it was lighted on the other by windows which Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle , before Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber , and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable , left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress . CHAPTER 21 A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of . It was by no means unreasonably large , and contained neither tapestry nor velvet . The walls were papered , the floor was carpeted ; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing - room below ; the furniture , though not of the latest fashion , was handsome and comfortable , and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful . Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay . Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste , and she was preparing to unpin the linen package , which the chaise - seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation , when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest , standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace . The sight of it made her start ; and , forgetting everything else , she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder , while these thoughts crossed her : “
57758	58299	58352	58352	I	0	” She advanced and examined it closely : it was of cedar , curiously inlaid with some darker wood , and raised , about a foot from the ground , on a carved stand of the same . The lock was silver , though tarnished from age ; at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver , broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence ; and , on the centre of the lid , was a mysterious cipher , in the same metal . Catherine bent over it intently , but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty . She could not , in whatever direction she took it , believe the last letter to be a T ; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment . If not originally theirs , by what strange events could it have fallen into the Tilney family ? Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater ; and seizing , with trembling hands , the hasp of the lock , she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents . With difficulty , for something seemed to resist her efforts , she raised the lid a few inches ; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her , starting , quit her hold , and the lid closed with alarming violence . This ill - timed intruder was Miss Tilney ’s maid , sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland ; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her , it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing , and forced her , in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery , to proceed in her dressing without further delay . Her progress was not quick , for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm ; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt , she could not remain many paces from the chest . At length , however , having slipped one arm into her gown , her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged . One moment surely might be spared ; and , so desperate should be the exertion of her strength , that , unless secured by supernatural means , the lid in one moment should be thrown back . With this spirit she sprang forward , and her confidence did not deceive her . Her resolute effort threw back the lid , and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane , properly folded , reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession ! She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney , anxious for her friend ’s being ready , entered the room , and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation , was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search . “
58311	58328	58352	58352	I	0	” said Miss Tilney , as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass . “
58408	58496	58782	58782	she	1276	” Catherine had no leisure for speech , being at once blushing , tying her gown , and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch . Miss Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “
58504	58780	58782	58782	she	1276	” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace . The dining - parlour was a noble room , suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing - room than the one in common use , and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine , who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants . Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “
58798	58799	58782	58782	she	1276	” “
58804	58811	58782	58782	she	1276	” was Catherine ’s honest assurance ; “
58826	59242	58812	58813	Mr. Allen	87	” and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life . The General ’s good humour increased . Why , as he had such rooms , he thought it would be simple not to make use of them ; but , upon his honour , he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size . Mr. Allen ’s house , he was sure , must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness . The evening passed without any further disturbance , and , in the occasional absence of General Tilney , with much positive cheerfulness . It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them . The night was stormy ; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon ; and by the time the party broke up , it blew and rained violently . Catherine , as she crossed the hall , listened to the tempest with sensations of awe ; and , when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door , felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey . Yes , these were characteristic sounds ; they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes , which such buildings had witnessed , and such storms ushered in ; and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn ! She had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants . Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning . In a house so furnished , and so guarded , she could have nothing to explore or to suffer , and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton . Thus wisely fortifying her mind , as she proceeded upstairs , she was enabled , especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her , to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart ; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire . “
59249	59258	58782	58782	she	1276	” said she , as she walked to the fender—“how
59368	59499	59500	59500	She	1285	” She looked round the room . The window curtains seemed in motion . It could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters ; and she stepped boldly forward , carelessly humming a tune , to assure herself of its being so , peeped courageously behind each curtain , saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her , and on placing a hand against the shutter , felt the strongest conviction of the wind ’s force . A glance at the old chest , as she turned away from this examination , was not without its use ; she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy , and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed . “
59556	60180	59528	59528	she	1285	” The fire therefore died away , and Catherine , having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements , was beginning to think of stepping into bed , when , on giving a parting glance round the room , she was struck by the appearance of a high , old - fashioned black cabinet , which , though in a situation conspicuous enough , had never caught her notice before . Henry ’s words , his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first , immediately rushed across her ; and though there could be nothing really in it , there was something whimsical , it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence ! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet . It was not absolutely ebony and gold ; but it was japan , black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind ; and as she held her candle , the yellow had very much the effect of gold . The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said . In short , she could not sleep till she had examined it . So , placing the candle with great caution on a chair , she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it ; but it resisted her utmost strength . Alarmed , but not discouraged , she tried it another way ; a bolt flew , and she believed herself successful ; but how strangely mysterious ! the door was still immovable . She paused a moment in breathless wonder . The wind roared down the chimney , the rain beat in torrents against the windows , and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation . To retire to bed , however , unsatisfied on such a point , would be vain , since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity . Again , therefore , she applied herself to the key , and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope ’s last effort , the door suddenly yielded to her hand : her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory , and having thrown open each folding door , the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock , though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual , a double range of small drawers appeared in view , with some larger drawers above and below them ; and in the centre , a small door , closed also with a lock and key , secured in all probability a cavity of importance . Catherine ’s heart beat quick , but her courage did not fail her . With a cheek flushed by hope , and an eye straining with curiosity , her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth . It was entirely empty . With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second , a third , a fourth ; each was equally empty . Not one was left unsearched , and in not one was anything found . Well read in the art of concealing a treasure , the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her , and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain . The place in the middle alone remained now unexplored ; and though she had “
60228	61237	61797	61798	Your sister	314	” It was some time however before she could unfasten the door , the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer ; but at length it did open ; and not vain , as hitherto , was her search ; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity , apparently for concealment , and her feelings at that moment were indescribable . Her heart fluttered , her knees trembled , and her cheeks grew pale . She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest . The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm ; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction ; it had yet some hours to burn ; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion , she hastily snuffed it . Alas ! it was snuffed and extinguished in one . A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect . Catherine , for a few moments , was motionless with horror . It was done completely ; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath . Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room . A violent gust of wind , rising with sudden fury , added fresh horror to the moment . Catherine trembled from head to foot . In the pause which succeeded , a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear . Human nature could support no more . A cold sweat stood on her forehead , the manuscript fell from her hand , and groping her way to the bed , she jumped hastily in , and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes . To close her eyes in sleep that night , she felt must be entirely out of the question . With a curiosity so justly awakened , and feelings in every way so agitated , repose must be absolutely impossible . The storm too abroad so dreadful ! she had not been used to feel alarm from wind , but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence . The manuscript so wonderfully found , so wonderfully accomplishing the morning ’s prediction , how was it to be accounted for ? What could it contain ? To whom could it relate ? By what means could it have been so long concealed ? And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it ! till she had made herself mistress of its contents , however , she could have neither repose nor comfort ; and with the sun ’s first rays she was determined to peruse it . But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene . She shuddered , tossed about in her bed , and envied every quiet sleeper . The storm still raged , and various were the noises , more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear . The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion , and at another the lock of her door was agitated , as if by the attempt of somebody to enter . Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery , and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans . Hour after hour passed away , and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep . CHAPTER 22 The housemaid ’s folding back her window - shutters at eight o’clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine ; and she opened her eyes , wondering that they could ever have been closed , on objects of cheerfulness ; her fire was already burning , and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night . Instantaneously , with the consciousness of existence , returned her recollection of the manuscript ; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid ’s going away , she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground , and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow . She now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books , for the roll , seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets , was altogether but of trifling size , and much less than she had supposed it to be at first . Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page . She started at its import . Could it be possible , or did not her senses play her false ? An inventory of linen , in coarse and modern characters , seemed all that was before her ! if the evidence of sight might be trusted , she held a washing - bill in her hand . She seized another sheet , and saw the same articles with little variation ; a third , a fourth , and a fifth presented nothing new . Shirts , stockings , cravats , and waistcoats faced her in each . Two others , penned by the same hand , marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting , in letters , hair - powder , shoe - string , and breeches - ball . And the larger sheet , which had enclosed the rest , seemed by its first cramp line , “
61241	61735	61797	61798	Your sister	314	mare”—a farrier ’s bill ! such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night ’s rest ! she felt humbled to the dust . Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ? A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her . Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies . To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable!—Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all ! How could she have so imposed on herself ? Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly ! and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it . This was the only comfort that occurred . Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly , those detestable papers then scattered over the bed , she rose directly , and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before , returned them to the same spot within the cabinet , with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again , to disgrace her even with herself . Why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable , for she could now manage them with perfect ease . In this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute , till the possibility of the door ’s having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener , darted into her head , and cost her another blush . She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before . Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest , with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited , was rather distressing . For the world would she not have her weakness suspected , and yet , unequal to an absolute falsehood , was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little . “
61745	61757	61737	61737	we	1289	” she added , desiring to get rid of the subject ; “
61782	61783	61773	61773	i	0	” “
61795	61796	61787	61787	you	0	” “
61848	61849	61808	61809	Mrs. Allen	89	” “
61953	61954	61996	61996	Mamma	138	” “
62003	62004	61996	61996	Mamma	138	” “
62057	62340	62049	62050	my sister	311	” Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the General , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind , but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure . The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine ’s notice when they were seated at table ; and , luckily , it had been the General ’s choice . He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste , confessed it to be neat and simple , thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country ; and for his part , to his uncritical palate , the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire , as from that of Dresden or Sêve . But this was quite an old set , purchased two years ago . The manufacture was much improved since that time ; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town , and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind , might have been tempted to order a new set . He trusted , however , that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one — though not for himself . Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him . Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston , where business required and would keep him two or three days . They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure . “
62353	62360	62049	62050	my sister	311	” observed the General to Eleanor . “
62372	62373	62049	62050	my sister	311	” “
62380	62384	62049	62050	my sister	311	” asked Catherine . “
62653	62785	62795	62795	he	1318	” The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes . The silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable . Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house , and he now offered himself as her conductor ; and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter , it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself , under any circumstances , not to be gladly accepted ; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey , and had seen only a few of its rooms . The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . “
62810	62816	62795	62795	he	1318	” She curtsied her acquiescence . “
62944	63003	62928	62928	He	1318	” He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney ’s saying , with a little confusion , “
63041	63479	63494	63494	he	1327	” Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood . Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed ? Could there be any unwillingness on the General ’s side to show her over the abbey ? The proposal was his own . And was not it odd that he should always take his walk so early ? Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so . It was certainly very provoking . She was all impatience to see the house , and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds . If Henry had been with them indeed ! But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it . Such were her thoughts , but she kept them to herself , and put on her bonnet in patient discontent . She was struck , however , beyond her expectation , by the grandeur of the abbey , as she saw it for the first time from the lawn . The whole building enclosed a large court ; and two sides of the quadrangle , rich in Gothic ornaments , stood forward for admiration . The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees , or luxuriant plantations , and the steep woody hills rising behind , to give it shelter , were beautiful even in the leafless month of March . Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it ; and her feelings of delight were so strong , that without waiting for any better authority , she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise . The General listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour . The kitchen - garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park . The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen ’s , as well as her father ’s , including church - yard and orchard . The walls seemed countless in number , endless in length ; a village of hot - houses seemed to arise among them , and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure . The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “
63601	63602	63586	63587	Mr. Allen	87	” “
63624	63666	63609	63610	Mr. Allen	87	” With a triumphant smile of self - satisfaction , the General wished he could do the same , for he never entered his , without being vexed in some way or other , by its falling short of his plan . “
63677	63689	63669	63670	Mr. Allen	87	” describing the nature of his own as they entered them . “
63724	63725	63726	63726	He	87	” “
63732	63820	63726	63726	He	87	” said the General , with a look of very happy contempt . Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired . “
63855	63856	63847	63847	Our	1342	” “
63866	63871	63847	63847	Our	1342	” said Miss Tilney , “
63890	63971	63988	63988	them	1346	” It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General ’s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward . He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition . He excused himself , however , from attending them : “
63993	64049	64050	64050	I	0	” He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “
64058	64067	64050	64050	I	0	” said her companion , with a sigh . “
64076	64118	64127	64127	her	598	” Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before , and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance , and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more . “
64129	64133	64119	64119	I	0	” added Eleanor ; “
64167	64168	64161	64161	her	598	” “
64174	64178	64161	64161	her	598	” reflected Catherine , “
64194	64205	64187	64188	the General	2215	” Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , “
64215	64216	64217	64221	A great and increasing one	1351	” “
64223	64233	64217	64221	A great and increasing one	1351	” replied the other , in a low voice . “
64275	64290	64291	64291	I	0	” She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “
64336	64337	64358	64359	A mother	880	” “
64348	64349	64350	64351	A mother	880	” “
64376	64377	64379	64379	she	880	” “
64415	64517	64402	64402	she	880	spirits?”—were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine ’s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not . Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded . The General certainly had been an unkind husband . He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ? And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “
64524	64535	64521	64521	I	0	” blushing at the consummate art of her own question , “
64543	64544	64518	64518	Her	880	” “
64609	64929	66568	66568	I	0	” Here was another proof . A portrait — very like — of a departed wife , not valued by the husband ! he must have been dreadfully cruel to her ! Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion . Yes , aversion ! his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her . She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary . She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled . Being no longer able , however , to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects , she soon began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house . He would follow them in a quarter of an hour . Again they parted — but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return . This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable . CHAPTER 23 An hour passed away before the General came in , spent , on the part of his young guest , in no very favourable consideration of his character . “
64953	66259	66568	66568	I	0	” At length he appeared ; and , whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations , he could still smile with them . Miss Tilney , understanding in part her friend ’s curiosity to see the house , soon revived the subject ; and her father being , contrary to Catherine ’s expectations , unprovided with any pretence for further delay , beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return , was at last ready to escort them . They set forward ; and , with a grandeur of air , a dignified step , which caught the eye , but could not shake the doubts of the well - read Catherine , he led the way across the hall , through the common drawing - room and one useless antechamber , into a room magnificent both in size and furniture — the real drawing - room , used only with company of consequence . It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General : the costliness or elegance of any room ’s fitting - up could be nothing to her ; she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century . When the General had satisfied his own curiosity , in a close examination of every well - known ornament , they proceeded into the library , an apartment , in its way , of equal magnificence , exhibiting a collection of books , on which an humble man might have looked with pride . Catherine heard , admired , and wondered with more genuine feeling than before — gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge , by running over the titles of half a shelf , and was ready to proceed . But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes . Large as was the building , she had already visited the greatest part ; though , on being told that , with the addition of the kitchen , the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court , she could scarcely believe it , or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted . It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats . From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present . The General ’s improving hand had not loitered here : every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this , their spacious theatre ; and , when the genius of others had failed , his own had often produced the perfection wanted . His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent . With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey ; the fourth side of the quadrangle having , on account of its decaying state , been removed by the General ’s father , and the present erected in its place . All that was venerable ceased here . The new building was not only new , but declared itself to be so ; intended only for offices , and enclosed behind by stable - yards , no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary . Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest , for the purposes of mere domestic economy ; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen , had the General allowed it ; but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on . They took a slight survey of all ; and Catherine was impressed , beyond her expectation , by their multiplicity and their convenience . The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton , were here carried on in appropriate divisions , commodious and roomy . The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices . Wherever they went , some pattened girl stopped to curtsy , or some footman in dishabille sneaked off . Yet this was an abbey ! how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about — from abbeys and castles , in which , though certainly larger than Northanger , all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost . How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . They returned to the hall , that the chief staircase might be ascended , and the beauty of its wood , and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out : having gained the top , they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay , and shortly entered one on the same plan , but superior in length and breadth . She was here shown successively into three large bed - chambers , with their dressing - rooms , most completely and handsomely fitted up ; everything that money and taste could do , to give comfort and elegance to apartments , had been bestowed on these ; and , being furnished within the last five years , they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing , and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine . As they were surveying the last , the General , after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured , turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine , and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be “
66265	66567	66568	66568	I	0	” She felt the unexpected compliment , and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself , and so full of civility to all her family . The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ? Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest . The General ’s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant . Something was certainly to be concealed ; her fancy , though it had trespassed lately once or twice , could not mislead her here ; and what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “
66589	66729	66568	66568	I	0	” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine . It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience . She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour . Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered . “
66739	66749	66736	66736	I	0	” said she , in a tone of feeling . “
66754	66755	66736	66736	I	0	” “
66768	66769	66770	66770	She	1373	” “
66778	66813	66770	66770	She	1373	” And nine years , Catherine knew , was a trifle of time , compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife , before her room was put to rights . “
66826	66827	66814	66814	You	0	” “
66830	66837	66814	66814	You	0	” said Miss Tilney , sighing ; “
66861	67017	67018	67019	My father	616	” Catherine ’s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words . Could it be possible ? Could Henry ’s father — ? And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions ! and , when she saw him in the evening , while she worked with her friend , slowly pacing the drawing - room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness , with downcast eyes and contracted brow , she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him . It was the air and attitude of a Montoni ! what could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity , in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt ? Unhappy man ! and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly , as to catch Miss Tilney ’s notice . “
67021	67025	67018	67019	My father	616	” she whispered , “
67040	67041	67018	67019	My father	616	” “
67047	67151	67152	67152	I	0	” thought Catherine ; such ill - timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks , and boded nothing good . After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell . When the butler would have lit his master ’s candle , however , he was forbidden . The latter was not going to retire . “
67159	67165	67152	67152	I	0	” said he to Catherine , “
67220	68594	68595	68595	Eleanor	142	” But neither the business alleged , nor the magnificent compliment , could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose . To be kept up for hours , after the family were in bed , by stupid pamphlets was not very likely . There must be some deeper cause : something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept ; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived , shut up for causes unknown , and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food , was the conclusion which necessarily followed . Shocking as was the idea , it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened , as , in the natural course of things , she must ere long be released . The suddenness of her reputed illness , the absence of her daughter , and probably of her other children , at the time — all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment . Its origin — jealousy perhaps , or wanton cruelty — was yet to be unravelled . In revolving these matters , while she undressed , it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman ’s confinement — might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days ; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division ? In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account . To what might not those doors lead ? In support of the plausibility of this conjecture , it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery , in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney , must be , as certainly as her memory could guide her , exactly over this suspected range of cells , and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse , communicating by some secret means with those cells , might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband . Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well - prepared insensibility ! Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises , and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far ; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible . The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General ’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up . Till midnight , she supposed it would be in vain to watch ; but then , when the clock had struck twelve , and all was quiet , she would , if not quite appalled by darkness , steal out and look once more . The clock struck twelve — and Catherine had been half an hour asleep . CHAPTER 24 The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments . It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the General in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine ’s curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o’clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp . The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney , which immediately fronted the family pew . By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained ; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph , in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband , who must have been in some way or other her destroyer , affected her even to tears . That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine . Not , however , that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced . She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice , going on from crime to crime , murdering whomsoever they chose , without any feeling of humanity or remorse ; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career . The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney ’s actual decease . Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber , were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed — what could it avail in such a case ? Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced , and a supposititious funeral carried on . The succeeding morning promised something better . The General ’s early walk , ill - timed as it was in every other view , was favourable here ; and when she knew him to be out of the house , she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise . Eleanor was ready to oblige her ; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise , their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed - chamber . It represented a very lovely woman , with a mild and pensive countenance , justifying , so far , the expectations of its new observer ; but they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry ’s , of Eleanor’s — the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child . A face once taken was taken for generations . But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness . She contemplated it , however , in spite of this drawback , with much emotion , and , but for a yet stronger interest , would have left it unwillingly . Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse ; she could only look at her companion . Eleanor ’s countenance was dejected , yet sedate ; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing . Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her ! the name of “
68596	68857	68858	68858	My	0	” at the same moment , in his loudest tone , resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror . An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again . She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry General to attend him in his own apartment . No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors . The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present . And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , “
68868	69725	69726	69727	Mr. Tilney	97	” she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the General , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so . Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence , after the company left them , and nothing occurred to disturb it . In the course of this morning ’s reflections , she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone . It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter . To involve her in the danger of a second detection , to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart , could not be the office of a friend . The General ’s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter ; and , besides , she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion . It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions , from which the other had , in all likelihood , been hitherto happily exempt ; nor could she therefore , in her presence , search for those proofs of the General ’s cruelty , which however they might yet have escaped discovery , she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth , in the shape of some fragmented journal , continued to the last gasp . Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress ; and as she wished to get it over before Henry ’s return , who was expected on the morrow , there was no time to be lost . The day was bright , her courage high ; at four o’clock , the sun was now two hours above the horizon , and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual . It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike . It was no time for thought ; she hurried on , slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors , and without stopping to look or breathe , rushed forward to the one in question . The lock yielded to her hand , and , luckily , with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being . On tiptoe she entered ; the room was before her ; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step . She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature . She saw a large , well - proportioned apartment , an handsome dimity bed , arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid ’s care , a bright Bath stove , mahogany wardrobes , and neatly painted chairs , on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows ! Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were . Astonishment and doubt first seized them ; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame . She could not be mistaken as to the room ; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!—in Miss Tilney ’s meaning , in her own calculation ! this apartment , to which she had given a date so ancient , a position so awful , proved to be one end of what the General ’s father had built . There were two other doors in the chamber , leading probably into dressing - closets ; but she had no inclination to open either . Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked , or the volume in which she had last read , remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper ? No : whatever might have been the General ’s crimes , he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection . She was sick of exploring , and desired but to be safe in her own room , with her own heart only privy to its folly ; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered , when the sound of footsteps , she could hardly tell where , made her pause and tremble . To be found there , even by a servant , would be unpleasant ; but by the General ( and he seemed always at hand when least wanted ) , much worse ! she listened — the sound had ceased ; and resolving not to lose a moment , she passed through and closed the door . At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened ; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs , by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery . She had no power to move . With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view . “
69729	69746	69726	69727	Mr. Tilney	97	” she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment . He looked astonished too . “
69750	69760	69726	69727	Mr. Tilney	97	” she continued , not attending to his address . “
69773	69774	69768	69768	you	97	” “
69782	69789	69777	69777	I	0	” he replied , greatly surprised . “
69815	69854	69809	69809	I	0	” Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . She moved on towards the gallery . “
69864	69876	69809	69809	I	0	” said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , “
69912	69913	69914	69914	I	0	” “
69918	69925	69914	69914	I	0	” said Catherine , looking down , “

70111	70116	70089	70089	she	1400	” dropping her voice , “
70123	70124	70089	70089	she	1400	” “
70130	70138	70089	70089	she	1400	” said Henry , earnestly regarding her . “
70150	70151	70140	70140	you	0	” “
70172	70173	70166	70166	I	0	” “
70182	70187	70166	70166	I	0	” showing his watch ; “
70214	70258	70260	70260	you	0	” She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him . They walked slowly up the gallery . “
70271	70272	70260	70260	you	0	” “
70290	70291	70282	70282	Isabella	105	” “
70405	70406	70394	70394	She	598	” “
70409	70410	70394	70394	She	598	” “
70419	70440	70394	70394	She	598	” Catherine said nothing . After a short silence , during which he had closely observed her , he added , “
70550	70551	70537	70537	Eleanor	142	” “
70579	70591	70593	70593	you	1417	” ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , “
70618	70619	70606	70606	I	0	” “
70625	70637	70606	70606	I	0	” he replied ( his quick eye fixed on hers ) , “
70647	70651	70606	70606	I	0	some”—(involuntarily she shook her head)—“or
70662	70678	70679	70679	My	0	” She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before . “
70684	70688	70679	70679	My	0	” he continued , “
70872	70873	70875	70876	your father	813	” “
70878	70882	70875	70876	your father	813	” said Catherine , “
70887	70888	70875	70876	your father	813	” “
70994	70995	70996	70996	I	0	” “
71003	71007	70996	70996	I	0	” said Catherine ; “
71015	71016	70996	70996	I	0	” “
71177	72383	71173	71173	you	0	” They had reached the end of the gallery , and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room . CHAPTER 25 The visions of romance were over . Catherine was completely awakened . Henry ’s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done . Most grievously was she humbled . Most bitterly did she cry . It was not only with herself that she was sunk — but with Henry . Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever . The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father — could he ever forgive it ? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears — could they ever be forgotten ? She hated herself more than she could express . He had — she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her . But now — in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor ’s inquiry if she was well . The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual . Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it . The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness ; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity . She did not learn either to forget or defend the past ; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther , and that it might not cost her Henry ’s entire regard . Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done , nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary , self - created delusion , each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm , and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which , before she entered the abbey , had been craving to be frightened . She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger . She saw that the infatuation had been created , the mischief settled , long before her quitting Bath , and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged . Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe ’s works , and charming even as were the works of all her imitators , it was not in them perhaps that human nature , at least in the Midland counties of England , was to be looked for . Of the Alps and Pyrenees , with their pine forests and their vices , they might give a faithful delineation ; and Italy , Switzerland , and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented . Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities . But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved , in the laws of the land , and the manners of the age . Murder was not tolerated , servants were not slaves , and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured , like rhubarb , from every druggist . Among the Alps and Pyrenees , perhaps , there were no mixed characters . There , such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend . But in England it was not so ; among the English , she believed , in their hearts and habits , there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad . Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable . Her mind made up on these several points , and her resolution formed , of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense , she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever ; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day . Henry ’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said . There were still some subjects , indeed , under which she believed they must always tremble — the mention of a chest or a cabinet , for instance — and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape : but even she could allow that an occasional memento of past folly , however painful , might not be without use . The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance . Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater . She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James . Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella . James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton . But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it ! this made it so particularly strange ! For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry ’s willing hand . She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself . “
72392	72414	72388	72388	James	107	” as she looked at the direction . She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “
72418	72759	72415	72416	Dear Catherine	170	“ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me . I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again . I shall not enter into particulars — they would only pain you more . You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! i am undeceived in time ! but it is a heavy blow ! after my father ’s consent had been so kindly given — but no more of this . She has made me miserable forever ! let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; your love I do build upon . I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced . Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much . I have written to him and my father . Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears . I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man . I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney . We parted at last by mutual consent — happy for me had we never met ! i can never expect to know such another woman ! Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart . “
72763	73162	72415	72416	Dear Catherine	170	” & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began . He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father ’s entrance . They went to breakfast directly ; but Catherine could hardly eat anything . Tears filled her eyes , and even ran down her cheeks as she sat . The letter was one moment in her hand , then in her lap , and then in her pocket ; and she looked as if she knew not what she did . The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible . As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room ; but the housemaids were busy in it , and she was obliged to come down again . She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her . She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour ’s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration . Perhaps , if particularly questioned , she might just give an idea — just distantly hint at it — but not more . To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her — and then their own brother so closely concerned in it ! She believed she must waive the subject altogether . Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously . Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “
73191	73192	73182	73182	I	0	” “
73198	73206	73197	73197	you	1437	” ( sighing as she spoke ) ; “
73222	73242	73217	73218	my brother	405	” Nothing further was said for a few minutes ; and then speaking through her tears , she added , “
73256	73257	73258	73258	I	0	” “
73262	73274	73258	73258	I	0	” said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; “
73296	73297	73286	73286	I	0	” “
73319	73320	73313	73313	you	1437	” “
73333	73338	73313	73313	you	1437	” replied Henry warmly , “
73349	73350	73313	73313	you	1437	” “
73358	73370	73381	73381	you	1437	” said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , “
73395	73396	73381	73381	you	1437	” “
73402	73403	73381	73381	you	1437	” “
73442	73479	73439	73440	Captain Tilney	78	” Eleanor ’s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe ’s name was included , passed his lips . “
73485	73489	73490	73490	you	1437	” cried Catherine : “
73562	73563	73564	73564	I	0	” “
73649	73650	73612	73612	I	0	” “
73673	73682	73684	73684	you	1437	” recollecting with a blush the last line . “
73699	73700	73684	73684	you	1437	” “
73707	73717	73705	73705	yourself	1437	” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer . “
73727	73738	73723	73723	I	0	” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “
73748	73770	73739	73739	James	107	” He gladly received the letter , and , having read it through , with close attention , returned it saying , “
73826	73862	73811	73811	I	0	” Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune . “
73873	73879	73866	73871	a very good sort of woman	1461	” was Catherine ’s answer . “
73885	73886	73887	73888	A lawyer	1463	” “
73898	73899	73893	73893	They	1464	” “
73906	73907	73902	73904	a wealthy family	1465	” “
73963	73973	73940	73940	He	813	” The brother and sister looked at each other . “
73976	73985	73940	73940	He	813	” said Eleanor , after a short pause , “
74077	74078	74056	74056	Frederick	78	” “
74199	74200	74201	74207	Such a sister - in - law	1479	” “
74216	74223	74209	74209	Henry	97	” said Eleanor with a smile . “
74227	74231	74209	74209	Henry	97	” observed Catherine , “
74264	74265	74259	74259	she	99	” “
74273	74277	74267	74267	I	0	” replied Henry ; “
74316	74317	74303	74303	I	0	” “
74386	74387	74362	74362	she	99	” “
74400	74401	74402	74402	My	0	” “
74429	74430	74431	74431	Your	0	” “
74577	74578	74572	74572	You	0	” “
74581	74592	74572	74572	You	0	” said Catherine , after a few moments ’ reflection , “
74652	74653	74654	74654	You	0	” “
74685	75138	74680	74680	they	1494	” Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it . CHAPTER 26 From this time , the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people ; and Catherine found , with some surprise , that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella ’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother . Their persuasion that the General would , upon this ground alone , independent of the objection that might be raised against her character , oppose the connection , turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself . She was as insignificant , and perhaps as portionless , as Isabella ; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself , at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest ? The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money , which she had more than once heard him utter , and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children . They were so fully convinced , however , that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father ’s consent , and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time , that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own . But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations . She proposed it to him accordingly ; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected . “
75141	75145	74680	74680	they	1494	” said he , “
75173	75174	75166	75166	He	0	” “
75184	75185	75176	75176	he	0	” “
75192	75445	75176	75176	he	0	” A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney . His brother and sister knew not what to think . Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement , and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it . The General , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick ’s remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland ’s time at Northanger pass pleasantly . He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day ’s society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood . But then it was such a dead time of year , no wild - fowl , no game , and the Lady Frasers were not in the country . And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him . Henry was greatly honoured and very happy , and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme . “
75487	75488	75449	75449	you	1496	” “
75787	75848	75849	75849	I	0	” A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion , so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston ; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry , about an hour afterwards , came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting , and said , “
75956	75957	75943	75943	I	0	” “
75961	75971	75943	75943	I	0	” said Catherine , with a very long face . “
75975	75976	75943	75943	I	0	” “
76018	76019	76004	76004	I	0	” “
76025	76026	76004	76004	I	0	” “
76040	76041	76034	76034	I	0	” “
76076	76081	76059	76059	he	2215	” Henry only smiled . “
76156	76157	76158	76158	I	0	” “
76191	76851	76184	76184	Eleanor	142	” He went ; and , it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry ’s , she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right , however disagreeable to her his going . But the inexplicability of the General ’s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts . That he was very particular in his eating , she had , by her own unassisted observation , already discovered ; but why he should say one thing so positively , and mean another all the while , was most unaccountable ! how were people , at that rate , to be understood ? Who but Henry could have been aware of what his father was at ? From Saturday to Wednesday , however , they were now to be without Henry . This was the sad finale of every reflection : and Captain Tilney ’s letter would certainly come in his absence ; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet . The past , present , and future were all equally in gloom . Her brother so unhappy , and her loss in Isabella so great ; and Eleanor ’s spirits always affected by Henry ’s absence ! what was there to interest or amuse her ? She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies — always so smooth and so dry ; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house . The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building . What a revolution in her ideas ! she , who had so longed to be in an abbey ! now , there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well - connected parsonage , something like Fullerton , but better : Fullerton had its faults , but Woodston probably had none . If Wednesday should ever come ! It did come , and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for . It came — it was fine — and Catherine trod on air . By ten o’clock , the chaise and four conveyed the trio from the abbey ; and , after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles , they entered Woodston , a large and populous village , in a situation not unpleasant . Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed . At the further end of the village , and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it , stood the parsonage , a new - built substantial stone house , with its semicircular sweep and green gates ; and , as they drove up to the door , Henry , with the friends of his solitude , a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers , was ready to receive and make much of them . Catherine ’s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting . Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him . “
76861	76865	76852	76852	We	1519	” said he . “
76980	77183	77189	77189	you	1523	” Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits . The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General . It was a prettily shaped room , the windows reaching to the ground , and the view from them pleasant , though only over green meadows ; and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it . “
77226	77227	77228	77228	I	0	” “
77231	77242	77228	77228	I	0	” said the General , with a most satisfied smile , “
77260	77261	77307	77307	you	1523	” “
77301	77302	77303	77303	You	1523	” “
77333	78674	77322	77322	Robinson	177	” Such a compliment recalled all Catherine ’s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her . The influence of fresh objects and fresh air , however , was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations ; and , having reached the ornamental part of the premises , consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow , on which Henry ’s genius had begun to act about half a year ago , she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure - ground she had ever been in before , though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner . A saunter into other meadows , and through part of the village , with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements , and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about , brought them to four o’clock , when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three . At four they were to dine , and at six to set off on their return . Never had any day passed so quickly ! She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the General ; nay , that he was even looking at the side - table for cold meat which was not there . His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind . They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it . CHAPTER 27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : Bath , April My dearest Catherine , I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner . I really am quite ashamed of my idleness ; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing . I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other . Pray write to me soon , and direct to my own home . Thank God , we leave this vile place to - morrow . Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone . I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive . I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding . Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it . The spring fashions are partly down ; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine . I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me . I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together . I rejoice to say that the young man whom , of all others , I particularly abhor , has left Bath . You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away . Afterwards he got worse , and became quite my shadow . Many girls might have been taken in , for never were such attentions ; but I knew the fickle sex too well . He went away to his regiment two days ago , and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again . He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable . The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis : I pitied his taste , but took no notice of him . The last time we met was in Bath Street , and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me ; I would not even look at him . He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world . Such a contrast between him and your brother ! pray send me some news of the latter — I am quite unhappy about him ; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away , with a cold , or something that affected his spirits . I would write to him myself , but have mislaid his direction ; and , as I hinted above , am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss . Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights . I have not been to the Rooms this age , nor to the play , except going in last night with the Hodges , for a frolic , at half price : they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone . We happened to sit by the Mitchells , and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out . I knew their spite : at one time they could not be civil to me , but now they are all friendship ; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them . You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own . Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take . I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter — it is your dear brother ’s favourite colour . Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine . Its inconsistencies , contradictions , and falsehood struck her from the very first . She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her . Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty , and her demands impudent . “
78696	78741	78757	78757	she	105	” On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation . When she had finished it—“So
78746	78750	78744	78744	Isabella	105	” she cried , “
78837	78838	78835	78835	her	105	” “
78849	78853	78845	78845	you	0	” said Henry . “
78918	78919	78920	78920	I	0	” “
78992	78993	78995	78995	you	0	” “
79006	79007	79008	79008	I	0	” “
79016	79017	79012	79012	he	78	” “
79030	79036	79012	79012	he	78	” Henry bowed his assent . “
79108	79109	79097	79097	he	78	” “
79148	79149	79159	79160	your brother	463	” “
79162	79163	79159	79160	your brother	463	” “
79216	79636	79656	79656	her	1543	” Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness . Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable . She resolved on not answering Isabella ’s letter , and tried to think no more of it . CHAPTER 28 Soon after this , the General found himself obliged to go to London for a week ; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland ’s company , and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence . His departure gave Catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain . The happiness with which their time now passed , every employment voluntary , every laugh indulged , every meal a scene of ease and good humour , walking where they liked and when they liked , their hours , pleasures , and fatigues at their own command , made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the General ’s presence had imposed , and most thankfully feel their present release from it . Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day ; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one , and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other , she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy ; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit ; before the General came home , the fourth week would be turned , and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer . This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred ; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind , she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once , propose going away , and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken . Aware that if she gave herself much time , she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject , she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor , and of Eleanor ’s being in the middle of a speech about something very different , to start forth her obligation of going away very soon . Eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned . She had “
79705	79709	79695	79695	they	1546	” Catherine explained : “
79739	79740	79733	79733	they	1546	” “
79757	79758	79762	79762	she	1543	” “
79769	79770	79762	79762	she	1543	” “
79794	79795	79789	79789	you	1548	” “
79819	80156	79810	79810	I	0	” And it was directly settled that , till she had , her leaving them was not even to be thought of . In having this cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed , the force of the other was likewise weakened . The kindness , the earnestness of Eleanor ’s manner in pressing her to stay , and Henry ’s gratified look on being told that her stay was determined , were such sweet proofs of her importance with them , as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without . She did — almost always — believe that Henry loved her , and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them ; and believing so far , her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations . Henry was not able to obey his father ’s injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies , during his absence in London , the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights . His loss was not now what it had been while the General was at home ; it lessened their gaiety , but did not ruin their comfort ; and the two girls agreeing in occupation , and improving in intimacy , found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves , that it was eleven o’clock , rather a late hour at the abbey , before they quitted the supper - room on the day of Henry ’s departure . They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed , as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge , that a carriage was driving up to the door , and the next moment confirmed the idea by the loud noise of the house - bell . After the first perturbation of surprise had passed away , in a “
80166	80606	80607	80607	My	0	” it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother , whose arrival was often as sudden , if not quite so unseasonable , and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him . Catherine walked on to her chamber , making up her mind as well as she could , to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney , and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her , and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her , that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful . She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe ; and indeed , as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted , there could be no danger of it ; and as long as all mention of Bath scenes were avoided , she thought she could behave to him very civilly . In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent . Scarcely , however , had she convicted her fancy of error , when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start ; it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway — and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it . She trembled a little at the idea of anyone ’s approaching so cautiously ; but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm , or misled by a raised imagination , she stepped quietly forward , and opened the door . Eleanor , and only Eleanor , stood there . Catherine ’s spirits , however , were tranquillized but for an instant , for Eleanor ’s cheeks were pale , and her manner greatly agitated . Though evidently intending to come in , it seemed an effort to enter the room , and a still greater to speak when there . Catherine , supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney ’s account , could only express her concern by silent attention , obliged her to be seated , rubbed her temples with lavender water , and hung over her with affectionate solicitude . “
80620	80628	80611	80611	you	77	” were Eleanor ’s first connected words . “
80654	80655	80645	80645	I	0	” “
80661	80662	80645	80645	I	0	” “
80677	80699	80673	80673	I	0	” A new idea now darted into Catherine ’s mind , and turning as pale as her friend , she exclaimed , “
80707	80708	80709	80709	You	77	” “
80715	80725	80709	80709	You	77	” returned Eleanor , looking at her most compassionately ; “
80739	80817	80737	80737	himself	616	” Her voice faltered , and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name . His unlooked - for return was enough in itself to make Catherine ’s heart sink , and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told . She said nothing ; and Eleanor , endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness , but with eyes still cast down , soon went on . “
80977	80978	80979	80979	My	0	” “
80983	80996	80979	80979	My	0	” cried Catherine , suppressing her feelings as well as she could , “
81081	81082	81067	81067	you	142	” “
81093	81094	81097	81097	you	142	” “
81102	81125	81097	81097	you	142	” Eleanor made no answer ; and Catherine ’s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting , she added , thinking aloud , “
81235	81236	81227	81227	I	0	” “
81318	81327	81328	81328	I	0	” Catherine sat down , breathless and speechless . “
81493	81494	81465	81465	you	77	” “
81501	81509	81465	81465	you	77	” said Catherine in a faltering voice . “
81612	81637	81638	81638	I	0	” It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all ; and it was only for Eleanor ’s sake that she attempted it . “
81642	81646	81638	81638	I	0	” said she , “
81711	81712	81713	81713	I	0	” “
81807	81808	81800	81800	your	77	” “
81857	81886	81887	81887	I	0	” Eleanor saw that she wished to be alone ; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation , now left her with , “
81895	82846	81887	81887	I	0	” Catherine ’s swelling heart needed relief . In Eleanor ’s presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears , but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents . Turned from the house , and in such a way ! without any reason that could justify , any apology that could atone for the abruptness , the rudeness , nay , the insolence of it . Henry at a distance — not able even to bid him farewell . Every hope , every expectation from him suspended , at least , and who could say how long ? Who could say when they might meet again ? And all this by such a man as General Tilney , so polite , so well bred , and heretofore so particularly fond of her ! it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous . From what it could arise , and where it would end , were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm . The manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil , hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience , or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling ; of two days , the earliest fixed on , and of that almost the earliest hour , as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning , that he might not be obliged even to see her . What could all this mean but an intentional affront ? By some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him . Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion , but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected , or , at least , not supposed to be connected with it . Heavily passed the night . Sleep , or repose that deserved the name of sleep , was out of the question . That room , in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival , was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers . Yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then — how mournfully superior in reality and substance ! her anxiety had foundation in fact , her fears in probability ; and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil , the solitude of her situation , the darkness of her chamber , the antiquity of the building , were felt and considered without the smallest emotion ; and though the wind was high , and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house , she heard it all as she lay awake , hour after hour , without curiosity or terror . Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done . Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared . What so natural , as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it ? And she only wanted to know how far , after what had passed , an apology might properly be received by her . But the knowledge would have been useless here ; it was not called for ; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial — Eleanor brought no message . Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk . When everything was done they left the room , Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well - known , cherished object , and went down to the breakfast - parlour , where breakfast was prepared . She tried to eat , as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable ; but she had no appetite , and could not swallow many mouthfuls . The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery , and strengthened her distaste for everything before her . It was not four and twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast , but in circumstances how different ! with what cheerful ease , what happy , though false , security , had she then looked around her , enjoying everything present , and fearing little in future , beyond Henry ’s going to Woodston for a day ! happy , happy breakfast ! for Henry had been there ; Henry had sat by her and helped her . These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion , who sat as deep in thought as herself ; and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment . Catherine ’s colour rose at the sight of it ; and the indignity with which she was treated , striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force , made her for a short time sensible only of resentment . Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech . “
82855	82859	82860	82860	you	1587	” she cried ; “
82969	82970	82973	82973	Eleanor	142	” “
83007	83012	83013	83013	I	0	” Eleanor only replied , “
83045	83073	83027	83027	I	0	” But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine ’s pride in a moment , and she instantly said , “
83085	83317	83318	83318	her	1592	” There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle , though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of . It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case . Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment , but , upon examining her purse , was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend , she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home ; and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both , scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together . Short , however , was that time . The carriage was soon announced to be ready ; and Catherine , instantly rising , a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu ; and , as they entered the hall , unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either , she paused a moment , and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left “
83326	85157	83318	83318	her	1592	” But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings ; and , hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief , she darted across the hall , jumped into the chaise , and in a moment was driven from the door . CHAPTER 29 Catherine was too wretched to be fearful . The journey in itself had no terrors for her ; and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness . Leaning back in one corner of the carriage , in a violent burst of tears , she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head ; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it . Unfortunately , the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston ; and , for fourteen miles , every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different . Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive . The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life . It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage . Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard — had he even confused her by his too significant reference ! and now — what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ? The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge . Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each . Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her . If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation . If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house . But a justification so full of torture to herself , she trusted , would not be in his power . Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point , it was not , however , the one on which she dwelt most . There was a thought yet nearer , a more prevailing , more impetuous concern . How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment . To the General , of course , he would not dare to speak ; but to Eleanor — what might he not say to Eleanor about her ? In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries , on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose , the hours passed away , and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for . The pressing anxieties of thought , which prevented her from noticing anything before her , when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston , saved her at the same time from watching her progress ; and though no object on the road could engage a moment ’s attention , she found no stage of it tedious . From this , she was preserved too by another cause , by feeling no eagerness for her journey ’s conclusion ; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best , even after an absence such as hers — an eleven weeks ’ absence . What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family , that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it , extend an useless resentment , and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will ? She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor ’s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father ’s account , it would cut her to the heart . With these feelings , she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well - known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home . Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger ; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post - masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it ; so great had been her ignorance of her route . She met with nothing , however , to distress or frighten her . Her youth , civil manners , and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require ; and stopping only to change horses , she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm , and between six and seven o’clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton . A heroine returning , at the close of her career , to her native village , in all the triumph of recovered reputation , and all the dignity of a countess , with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons , and three waiting - maids in a travelling chaise and four , behind her , is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell ; it gives credit to every conclusion , and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows . But my affair is widely different ; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace ; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness . A heroine in a hack post - chaise is such a blow upon sentiment , as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand . Swiftly therefore shall her post - boy drive through the village , amid the gaze of Sunday groups , and speedy shall be her descent from it . But , whatever might be the distress of Catherine ’s mind , as she thus advanced towards the parsonage , and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it , she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went ; first , in the appearance of her carriage — and secondly , in herself . The chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton , the whole family were immediately at the window ; and to have it stop at the sweep - gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy — a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children , a boy and girl of six and four years old , who expected a brother or sister in every carriage . Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine ! happy the voice that proclaimed the discovery ! but whether such happiness were the lawful property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood . Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine ’s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible . So surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy ! in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her . Reluctantly , and with much hesitation , did she then begin what might perhaps , at the end of half an hour , be termed , by the courtesy of her hearers , an explanation ; but scarcely , within that time , could they at all discover the cause , or collect the particulars , of her sudden return . They were far from being an irritable race ; far from any quickness in catching , or bitterness in resenting , affronts : but here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter ’s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as a gentleman nor as a parent . Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “
85174	85202	85166	85166	he	1594	” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour . “
85216	85223	85206	85206	you	235	” said her mother at last ; “
85237	85238	85239	85239	I	0	” “
85254	85258	85206	85206	you	235	” said Sarah , “
85266	85267	85268	85268	I	0	” “
85276	85281	85268	85268	I	0	” returned Mrs. Morland ; “
85319	85323	85316	85317	General Tilney	139	” Catherine sighed . “
85326	85332	85316	85317	General Tilney	139	” continued her philosophic mother , “
85439	85836	85870	85871	Mrs. Allen	89	” Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother ’s next counsel of going early to bed . Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings , and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey , parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away ; and though , when they all met the next morning , her recovery was not equal to their hopes , they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil . They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough ! As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure . The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney . To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment — a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of — and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety . The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks , and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart . “
85844	85855	85870	85871	Mrs. Allen	89	” observed Mrs. Morland , as the letter was finished ; “
85921	85929	85913	85913	I	0	” Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , “
85940	85941	85938	85938	Eleanor	142	” “
85993	86154	86155	86155	We	1611	” Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation . The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine ’s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her . She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet — ! her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment . “
86161	86165	86155	86155	We	1611	” said she ; “
86267	86474	86475	86475	Catherine	77	” This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to ; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance , and made her reply less rational ; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well - known road . It was not three months ago since , wild with joyful expectation , she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day , with an heart light , gay , and independent ; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed , and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it . Three months ago had seen her all this ; and now , how altered a being did she return ! She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated — though Mrs. Morland ’s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions . “
86484	86488	86475	86475	Catherine	77	” said she . “
86589	86645	86668	86669	the General	2215	” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself . His wonder , his conjectures , and his explanations became in succession hers , with the addition of this single remark—“I
86652	86661	86662	86662	I	0	General”—to fill up every accidental pause . And , “
86671	86717	86668	86669	the General	2215	” was uttered twice after Mr. Allen left the room , without any relaxation of anger , or any material digression of thought . A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , “
86815	86816	86806	86806	you	235	” “
86826	86847	86806	86806	you	235	” said Catherine , her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there . “
86914	86915	86909	86909	you	235	” “
86923	86924	86917	86917	I	0	” “
86980	87000	87010	87014	an agreeable , worthy man	1633	” Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I
87065	87440	87441	87441	My	0	” As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends . There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine ’s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced . It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that now Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; now he must have heard of her departure ; and now , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford . CHAPTER 30 Catherine ’s disposition was not naturally sedentary , nor had her habits been ever very industrious ; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort , her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased . She could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together , walking round the garden and orchard again and again , as if nothing but motion was voluntary ; and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour . Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration . In her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself ; but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had been before . For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint ; but when a third night ’s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness , improved her in useful activity , nor given her a greater inclination for needlework , she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of , “
87524	87540	87541	87541	her	1639	” Catherine took up her work directly , saying , in a dejected voice , that “
87551	87552	87541	87541	her	1639	” “
87587	87591	87580	87580	You	77	” After a short silence—“I
87673	87674	87675	87675	I	0	” “
87697	87698	87733	87733	I	0	” “
87758	87997	87736	87736	I	0	” Catherine said no more , and , with an endeavour to do right , applied to her work ; but , after a few minutes , sunk again , without knowing it herself , into languor and listlessness , moving herself in her chair , from the irritation of weariness , much oftener than she moved her needle . Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse ; and seeing , in her daughter ’s absent and dissatisfied look , the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness , hastily left the room to fetch the book in question , anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady . It was some time before she could find what she looked for ; and other family matters occurring to detain her , a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped . Her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself , she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes , till , on entering the room , the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before . With a look of much respect , he immediately rose , and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as “
88002	88459	87736	87736	I	0	” with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there , acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton , and stating his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland ’s having reached her home in safety , as the cause of his intrusion . He did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart . Far from comprehending him or his sister in their father ’s misconduct , Mrs. Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each , and instantly , pleased by his appearance , received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence ; thanking him for such an attention to her daughter , assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there , and entreating him to say not another word of the past . He was not ill - inclined to obey this request , for , though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked - for mildness , it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose . Returning in silence to his seat , therefore , he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland ’s common remarks about the weather and roads . Catherine meanwhile — the anxious , agitated , happy , feverish Catherine — said not a word ; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good - natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time , and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour . Desirous of Mr. Morland ’s assistance , as well in giving encouragement , as in finding conversation for her guest , whose embarrassment on his father ’s account she earnestly pitied , Mrs. Morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him ; but Mr. Morland was from home — and being thus without any support , at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say . After a couple of minutes ’ unbroken silence , Henry , turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother ’s entrance , asked her , with sudden alacrity , if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton ? And on developing , from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply , the meaning , which one short syllable would have given , immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them , and , with a rising colour , asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way . “
88471	90651	88460	88460	You	1646	” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him . They began their walk , and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it . Some explanation on his father ’s account he had to give ; but his first purpose was to explain himself , and before they reached Mr. Allen ’s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often . She was assured of his affection ; and that heart in return was solicited , which , perhaps , they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own ; for , though Henry was now sincerely attached to her , though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society , I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude , or , in other words , that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought . It is a new circumstance in romance , I acknowledge , and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine ’s dignity ; but if it be as new in common life , the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own . A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application . On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more . Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand . The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight . The General had had nothing to accuse her of , nothing to lay to her charge , but her being the involuntary , unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon , and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own . She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be . Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims , he had courted her acquaintance in Bath , solicited her company at Northanger , and designed her for his daughter - in - law . On discovering his error , to turn her from the house seemed the best , though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself , and his contempt of her family . John Thorpe had first misled him . The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name . Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them . With whomsoever he was , or was likely to be connected , his own consequence always required that theirs should be great , and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew , so regularly grew their fortune . The expectations of his friend Morland , therefore , from the first overrated , had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light . For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate . Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter ; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed . Upon such intelligence the General had proceeded ; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority . Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness . His resolution was soon formed . Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes . Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this , than his own children . Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error . The Allens , he believed , had lived near them too long , and he knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve . The General needed no more . Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself , he set out the next day for the abbey , where his performances have been seen . I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James . I have united for their ease what they must divide for mine . Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty . Henry , in having such things to relate of his father , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself . He blushed for the narrow - minded counsel which he was obliged to expose . The conversation between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind . Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold . The General , accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family , prepared for no reluctance but of feeling , no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words , could ill brook the opposition of his son , steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it . But , in such a cause , his anger , though it must shock , could not intimidate Henry , who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice . He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland , and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain , no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent , no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger , could shake his fidelity , or influence the resolutions it prompted . He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand . The General was furious in his anger , and they parted in dreadful disagreement . Henry , in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose , had returned almost instantly to Woodston , and , on the afternoon of the following day , had begun his journey to Fullerton . CHAPTER 31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start . His pleasing manners and good sense were self - evident recommendations ; and having never heard evil of him , it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told . Goodwill supplying the place of experience , his character needed no attestation . “
90665	91209	90655	90660	a sad , heedless young housekeeper	1649	” was her mother ’s foreboding remark ; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice . There was but one obstacle , in short , to be mentioned ; but till that one was removed , it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement . Their tempers were mild , but their principles were steady , and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained — and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied — their willing approbation was instantly to follow . His consent was all that they wished for . They were no more inclined than entitled to demand his money . Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter . The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this . They felt and they deplored — but they could not resent it ; and they parted , endeavouring to hope that such a change in the General , as each believed almost impossible , might speedily take place , to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection . Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry . Whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence , let us not inquire . Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way . The anxiety , which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine , and of all who loved either , as to its final event , can hardly extend , I fear , to the bosom of my readers , who will see in the tell - tale compression of the pages before them , that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity . The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt : what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the General ’s ? The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “
91219	91375	91376	91376	Your	1652	” The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry ’s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance . My own joy on the occasion is very sincere . I know no one more entitled , by unpretending merit , or better prepared by habitual suffering , to receive and enjoy felicity . Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her . His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “
