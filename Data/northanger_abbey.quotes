Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil — she had no notion of drawing — not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover ’s profile , that she might be detected in the design . There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height . At present she did not know her own poverty , for she had no lover to portray . She had reached the age of seventeen , without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility , without having inspired one real passion , and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient . This was strange indeed ! but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out . There was not one lord in the neighbourhood ; no — not even a baronet . There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door — not one young man whose origin was unknown . Her father had no ward , and the squire of the parish no children . But when a young lady is to be a heroine , the perverseness of forty surrounding families can not prevent her . Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way . Mr. Allen , who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton , the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived , was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution — and his lady , a good - humoured woman , fond of Miss Morland , and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village , she must seek them abroad , invited her to go with them . Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance , and Catherine all happiness . CHAPTER 2 In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland ’s personal and mental endowments , when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks ’ residence in Bath , it may be stated , for the reader ’s more certain information , lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be , that her heart was affectionate ; her disposition cheerful and open , without conceit or affectation of any kind — her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl ; her person pleasing , and , when in good looks , pretty — and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is . When the hour of departure drew near , the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe . A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness , and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together ; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet . Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm - house , must , at such a moment , relieve the fulness of her heart . Who would not think so ? But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets , that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness , and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations . Her cautions were confined to the following points . “
2230	3312	3313	3313	I	0	” Sally , or rather Sarah ( for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can ? ) , must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister . It is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on Catherine ’s writing by every post , nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance , nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce . Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done , on the part of the Morlands , with a degree of moderation and composure , which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life , than with the refined susceptibilities , the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite . Her father , instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker , or even putting an hundred pounds bank - bill into her hands , gave her only ten guineas , and promised her more when she wanted it . Under these unpromising auspices , the parting took place , and the journey began . It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety . Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them , nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero . Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear , on Mrs. Allen ’s side , of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn , and that fortunately proved to be groundless . They arrived at Bath . Catherine was all eager delight — her eyes were here , there , everywhere , as they approached its fine and striking environs , and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel . She was come to be happy , and she felt happy already . They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street . It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen , that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work , and how she will , probably , contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable — whether by her imprudence , vulgarity , or jealousy — whether by intercepting her letters , ruining her character , or turning her out of doors . Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females , whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them . She had neither beauty , genius , accomplishment , nor manner . The air of a gentlewoman , a great deal of quiet , inactive good temper , and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible , intelligent man like Mr. Allen . In one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public , being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be . Dress was her passion . She had a most harmless delight in being fine ; and our heroine ’s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn , and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion . Catherine too made some purchases herself , and when all these matters were arranged , the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms . Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand , her clothes put on with care , and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do . With such encouragement , Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd . As for admiration , it was always very welcome when it came , but she did not depend on it . Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late . The season was full , the room crowded , and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could . As for Mr. Allen , he repaired directly to the card - room , and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves . With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protégée , Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door , as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow ; Catherine , however , kept close at her side , and linked her arm too firmly within her friend ’s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly . But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd ; it seemed rather to increase as they went on , whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door , they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience . But this was far from being the case , and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room , their situation was just the same ; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies . Still they moved on — something better was yet in view ; and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench . Here there was something less of crowd than below ; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her , and of all the dangers of her late passage through them . It was a splendid sight , and she began , for the first time that evening , to feel herself at a ball : she longed to dance , but she had not an acquaintance in the room . Mrs. Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly , every now and then , “
3330	3584	3327	3328	a partner	254	” For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes ; but they were repeated so often , and proved so totally ineffectual , that Catherine grew tired at last , and would thank her no more . They were not long able , however , to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained . Everybody was shortly in motion for tea , and they must squeeze out like the rest . Catherine began to feel something of disappointment — she was tired of being continually pressed against by people , the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest , and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives ; and when at last arrived in the tea - room , she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join , no acquaintance to claim , no gentleman to assist them . They saw nothing of Mr. Allen ; and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation , were obliged to sit down at the end of a table , at which a large party were already placed , without having anything to do there , or anybody to speak to , except each other . Mrs. Allen congratulated herself , as soon as they were seated , on having preserved her gown from injury . “
3596	3600	3327	3328	a partner	254	” said she , “
3633	3634	3629	3629	I	0	” “
3640	3644	3629	3629	I	0	” whispered Catherine , “
3653	3654	3629	3629	I	0	” “
3660	3669	3629	3629	I	0	” replied Mrs. Allen , with perfect serenity , “
3676	3677	3629	3629	I	0	” “
3708	3709	3693	3693	they	261	” “
3730	3731	3721	3721	I	0	” “
3745	3746	3740	3740	somebody	264	” “
3778	3779	3773	3773	they	267	” “
3802	3803	3799	3799	you	253	” “
3856	3857	3842	3842	Somebody	264	” “
3897	3898	3895	3895	somebody	264	” “
3973	4036	3946	3950	a strange - looking woman	275	” After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours ; it was thankfully accepted , and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it , which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening , till they were discovered and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over . “
4042	4048	4039	4040	Miss Morland	86	” said he , directly , “
4058	4059	4049	4049	I	0	” “
4064	4076	4049	4049	I	0	” she replied , vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn . “
4086	4091	4092	4092	I	0	” said his wife ; “
4155	4156	4157	4157	We	276	” “
4166	4701	4163	4163	I	0	” was Mr. Allen ’s consolation . The company began to disperse when the dancing was over — enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort ; and now was the time for a heroine , who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening , to be noticed and admired . Every five minutes , by removing some of the crowd , gave greater openings for her charms . She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before . Not one , however , started with rapturous wonder on beholding her , no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room , nor was she once called a divinity by anybody . Yet Catherine was in very good looks , and had the company only seen her three years before , they would _ now _ have thought her exceedingly handsome . She _ was _ looked at , however , and with some admiration ; for , in her own hearing , two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl . Such words had their due effect ; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before — her humble vanity was contented — she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms , and went to her chair in good humour with everybody , and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention . CHAPTER 3 Every morning now brought its regular duties — shops were to be visited ; some new part of the town to be looked at ; and the Pump - room to be attended , where they paraded up and down for an hour , looking at everybody and speaking to no one . The wish of a numerous acquaintance in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen , and she repeated it after every fresh proof , which every morning brought , of her knowing nobody at all . They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms ; and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine . The master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman - like young man as a partner ; his name was Tilney . He seemed to be about four or five and twenty , was rather tall , had a pleasing countenance , a very intelligent and lively eye , and , if not quite handsome , was very near it . His address was good , and Catherine felt herself in high luck . There was little leisure for speaking while they danced ; but when they were seated at tea , she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being . He talked with fluency and spirit — and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested , though it was hardly understood by her . After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with—“I
4791	4792	4786	4786	I	0	” “
4803	4804	4793	4793	You	279	” “
4814	4838	4808	4808	I	0	” Then forming his features into a set smile , and affectedly softening his voice , he added , with a simpering air , “
4848	4849	4840	4840	you	279	” “
4856	4865	4840	4840	you	279	” replied Catherine , trying not to laugh . “
4868	4873	4840	4840	you	279	” with affected astonishment . “
4882	4883	4876	4876	you	279	” “
4888	4897	4876	4876	you	279	” said he , in his natural tone . “
4939	4940	4932	4932	you	279	” “
4945	4946	4932	4932	you	279	” “
4957	4958	4961	4961	sir	285	” “
4969	4970	4961	4961	sir	285	” “
4978	4979	4982	4982	sir	285	” “
4992	4993	4984	4984	I	0	” “
4998	4999	5002	5002	sir	285	” “
5007	5008	5002	5002	sir	285	” “
5017	5018	5011	5011	you	279	” “
5027	5028	5021	5021	I	0	” “
5044	5060	5061	5061	I	0	” Catherine turned away her head , not knowing whether she might venture to laugh . “
5069	5072	5064	5064	you	279	” said he gravely—“I
5086	5087	5088	5088	My	0	” “
5091	5092	5088	5088	My	0	” “
5157	5158	5134	5140	a queer , half - witted man	300	” “
5167	5168	5160	5160	I	0	” “
5179	5180	5170	5170	I	0	” “
5185	5186	5187	5187	I	0	” “
5240	5241	5232	5232	I	0	” “
5251	5252	5246	5246	I	0	” “
5450	5451	5452	5452	I	0	” “
5457	5463	5452	5452	I	0	” said Catherine , doubtingly , “
5490	5491	5478	5478	I	0	” “
5524	5525	5529	5529	they	314	” “
5531	5532	5529	5529	they	314	” “
5553	5554	5556	5556	my	0	” “
5582	5583	5570	5570	You	279	” “
5635	5643	5644	5644	My	0	” They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen : “
5648	5652	5644	5644	My	0	” said she , “
5697	5698	5709	5709	madam	279	” “
5711	5721	5709	5709	madam	279	” said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin . “
5729	5730	5723	5723	you	0	” “
5805	5815	5816	5816	Men	316	” Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius . “
5826	5830	5816	5816	Men	316	” said she ; “
5858	5859	5846	5846	You	85	” “
5867	5868	5865	5865	madam	279	” “
5884	5885	5876	5876	you	285	” “
5893	5901	5891	5891	madam	279	” said he , gravely examining it ; “
5919	5920	5912	5912	I	0	” “
5925	5931	5923	5923	you	285	” said Catherine , laughing , “
5935	5940	5923	5923	you	285	” She had almost said “
5943	5944	5923	5923	you	285	” “
5954	5959	5945	5945	I	0	” replied Mrs. Allen ; “
5971	5972	5962	5962	I	0	” “
6048	6049	6029	6029	she	322	” “
6153	6205	6208	6208	you	340	” Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced . Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others . “
6214	6226	6208	6208	you	340	” said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; “
6250	6257	6258	6258	I	0	” Catherine coloured , and said , “
6265	6266	6258	6258	I	0	” “
6292	6293	6286	6286	you	340	” “
6301	6302	6304	6304	you	340	” “
6338	6694	6315	6315	I	0	” They danced again ; and , when the assembly closed , parted , on the lady ’s side at least , with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance . Whether she thought of him so much , while she drank her warm wine and water , and prepared herself for bed , as to dream of him when there , can not be ascertained ; but I hope it was no more than in a slight slumber , or a morning doze at most ; for if it be true , as a celebrated writer has maintained , that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman ’s love is declared,[1 ] it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her . How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen ’s head , but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied ; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was , and had been assured of Mr. Tilney ’s being a clergyman , and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire . [ 1 ] Vide a letter from Mr. Richardson , No . 97 , Vol . ii , Rambler . CHAPTER 4 With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump - room the next day , secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over , and ready to meet him with a smile ; but no smile was demanded — Mr. Tilney did not appear . Every creature in Bath , except himself , was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours ; crowds of people were every moment passing in and out , up the steps and down ; people whom nobody cared about , and nobody wanted to see ; and he only was absent . “
6702	6724	6315	6315	I	0	” said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock , after parading the room till they were tired ; “
6738	6771	6315	6315	I	0	” This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now ; but we are told to “
6779	6781	6315	6315	I	0	” as “
6788	6857	6858	6858	I	0	” ; and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward , for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age , who was sitting by her , and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes , addressed her with great complaisance in these words : “
6890	7218	6888	6888	Allen	88	” This question answered , as it readily was , the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe ; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate , whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages , and that many years ago . Their joy on this meeting was very great , as well it might , since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years . Compliments on good looks now passed ; and , after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together , how little they had thought of meeting in Bath , and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend , they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families , sisters , and cousins , talking both together , far more ready to give than to receive information , and each hearing very little of what the other said . Mrs. Thorpe , however , had one great advantage as a talker , over Mrs. Allen , in a family of children ; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons , and the beauty of her daughters , when she related their different situations and views — that John was at Oxford , Edward at Merchant Taylors ’ , and William at sea — and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were , Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give , no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend , and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions , consoling herself , however , with the discovery , which her keen eyes soon made , that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe ’s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own . “
7225	7249	7221	7223	my dear girls	348	” cried Mrs. Thorpe , pointing at three smart - looking females who , arm in arm , were then moving towards her . “
7302	7354	7297	7297	Isabella	103	” The Miss Thorpes were introduced ; and Miss Morland , who had been for a short time forgotten , was introduced likewise . The name seemed to strike them all ; and , after speaking to her with great civility , the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest , “
7364	7365	7360	7361	Miss Morland	86	” “
7373	7379	7384	7384	her	355	” cried the mother — and “
7390	8597	7384	7384	her	355	” was repeated by them all , two or three times over . For a moment Catherine was surprised ; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland , before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college , of the name of Thorpe ; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with his family , near London . The whole being explained , many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her ; of being considered as already friends , through the friendship of their brothers , etc . , which Catherine heard with pleasure , and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command ; and , as the first proof of amity , she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe , and take a turn with her about the room . Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance , and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe . Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love . Their conversation turned upon those subjects , of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies : such as dress , balls , flirtations , and quizzes . Miss Thorpe , however , being four years older than Miss Morland , and at least four years better informed , had a very decided advantage in discussing such points ; she could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge , its fashions with the fashions of London ; could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire ; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other ; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd . These powers received due admiration from Catherine , to whom they were entirely new ; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity , had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe ’s manners , and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her , softened down every feeling of awe , and left nothing but tender affection . Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump - room , but required , when they all quitted it together , that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen ’s house ; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands , after learning , to their mutual relief , that they should see each other across the theatre at night , and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning . Catherine then ran directly upstairs , and watched Miss Thorpe ’s progress down the street from the drawing - room window ; admired the graceful spirit of her walk , the fashionable air of her figure and dress ; and felt grateful , as well she might , for the chance which had procured her such a friend . Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty , and the younger ones , by pretending to be as handsome as their sister , imitating her air , and dressing in the same style , did very well . This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself , of her past adventures and sufferings , which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters ; in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth , and conversations , which had passed twenty years before , be minutely repeated . CHAPTER 5 Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain . Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump - room . She hoped to be more fortunate the next day ; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning , she hardly felt a doubt of it ; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants , and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is . As soon as divine service was over , the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other ; and after staying long enough in the pump - room to discover that the crowd was insupportable , and that there was not a genteel face to be seen , which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season , they hastened away to the Crescent , to breathe the fresh air of better company . Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner . He was nowhere to be met with ; every search for him was equally unsuccessful , in morning lounges or evening assemblies ; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms , at dressed or undressed balls , was he perceivable ; nor among the walkers , the horsemen , or the curricle - drivers of the morning . His name was not in the pump - room book , and curiosity could do no more . He must be gone from Bath . Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short ! this sort of mysteriousness , which is always so becoming in a hero , threw a fresh grace in Catherine ’s imagination around his person and manners , and increased her anxiety to know more of him . From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen . It was a subject , however , in which she often indulged with her fair friend , from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him ; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken . Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return . She liked him the better for being a clergyman , “
8608	8738	8739	8739	I	0	” ; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it . Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion — but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced . Mrs. Allen was now quite happy — quite satisfied with Bath . She had found some acquaintance , had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend ; and , as the completion of good fortune , had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself . Her daily expressions were no longer , “
8748	8754	8739	8739	I	0	” They were changed into , “
8766	9286	8763	8764	Mrs. Thorpe	98	” and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns . The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm , and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves . They called each other by their Christian name , were always arm in arm when they walked , pinned up each other ’s train for the dance , and were not to be divided in the set ; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments , they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt , and shut themselves up , to read novels together . Yes , novels ; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel - writers , of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances , to the number of which they are themselves adding — joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works , and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine , who , if she accidentally take up a novel , is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust . Alas ! if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another , from whom can she expect protection and regard ? I can not approve of it . Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure , and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans . Let us not desert one another ; we are an injured body . Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world , no species of composition has been so much decried . From pride , ignorance , or fashion , our foes are almost as many as our readers . And while the abilities of the nine - hundredth abridger of the History of England , or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton , Pope , and Prior , with a paper from the Spectator , and a chapter from Sterne , are eulogized by a thousand pens — there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist , and of slighting the performances which have only genius , wit , and taste to recommend them . “
9320	9328	9332	9332	you	0	” Such is the common ca nt . “
9339	9340	9335	9335	Miss	360	” “
9349	9369	9335	9335	Miss	360	” replies the young lady , while she lays down her book with affected indifference , or momentary shame . “
9380	9646	9647	9647	My	0	” ; or , in short , only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed , in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature , the happiest delineation of its varieties , the liveliest effusions of wit and humour , are conveyed to the world in the best - chosen language . Now , had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator , instead of such a work , how proudly would she have produced the book , and told its name ; though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication , of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste : the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances , unnatural characters , and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living ; and their language , too , frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it . CHAPTER 6 The following conversation , which took place between the two friends in the pump - room one morning , after an acquaintance of eight or nine days , is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment , and of the delicacy , discretion , originality of thought , and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment . They met by appointment ; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend , her first address naturally was , “
9670	9671	9659	9659	I	0	” “
9710	9711	9701	9701	I	0	” “
9864	9865	9862	9862	Udolpho	110	” “

9921	9922	9916	9916	you	361	” “

10076	10077	10078	10078	I	0	” “
10128	10129	10137	10137	they	371	” “

10414	10415	10429	10429	you	0	” “
10420	10426	10429	10429	you	0	” cried Catherine , colouring . “
10433	10434	10429	10429	you	0	” “
10502	10513	10495	10495	he	391	” Catherine coloured , and disclaimed again . Isabella laughed . “
10555	10557	10551	10551	I	0	you”—speaking more seriously—“your
10611	10612	10604	10604	i	0	” “
10638	10639	10642	10642	him	95	” “

10734	10735	10728	10728	Laurentina	111	” “
10761	10762	10765	10765	she	80	” “
10788	10789	10790	10792	Sir Charles Grandison	116	” “
10817	10818	10807	10808	Miss Andrews	114	” “
10836	10837	10839	10839	you	386	” “
10899	10900	10886	10887	The men	378	” “
10910	10917	10907	10907	they	378	” said Catherine , very innocently . “
10958	10959	10961	10961	they	378	” “
10980	10981	10972	10972	They	378	” “
11047	11048	11039	11039	you	76	” “
11079	11080	11084	11084	Catherine	76	” “
11163	11164	11170	11170	you	76	” “
11173	11174	11170	11170	you	76	” “
11196	11248	11182	11182	I	0	” Catherine , in some amazement , complied , and after remaining a few moments silent , was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world , Laurentina ’s skeleton , when her friend prevented her , by saying , “
11310	11340	11303	11303	They	409	” Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine ’s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men . “
11381	11413	11372	11372	I	0	” In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room . “
11421	11429	11430	11430	One	305	” said Isabella , turning hastily round . “
11440	11441	11432	11438	a very good - looking young man	413	” “
11450	11451	11442	11442	They	409	” “
11496	11501	11487	11487	You	0	” Catherine readily agreed . “
11504	11508	11487	11487	You	0	” she added , “
11518	11519	11487	11487	You	0	” “
11548	11549	11539	11539	I	0	” “
11571	11572	11573	11573	I	0	” “
11607	11895	11586	11586	I	0	” Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning ; and therefore , to show the independence of Miss Thorpe , and her resolution of humbling the sex , they set off immediately as fast as they could walk , in pursuit of the two young men . CHAPTER 7 Half a minute conducted them through the pump - yard to the archway , opposite Union Passage ; but here they were stopped . Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at this point ; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature , so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads , and the principal inn of the city , that a day never passes in which parties of ladies , however important their business , whether in quest of pastry , millinery , or even ( as in the present case ) of young men , are not detained on one side or other by carriages , horsemen , or carts . This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing - looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse . “
11902	11909	11586	11586	I	0	” said Isabella , looking up . “
11915	11936	11586	11586	I	0	” But this detestation , though so just , was of short duration , for she looked again and exclaimed , “
11946	11947	11939	11941	mr . Morland	76	” “
11955	12263	11953	11953	James	105	” was uttered at the same moment by Catherine ; and , on catching the young men ’s eyes , the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches , and the servant having now scampered up , the gentlemen jumped out , and the equipage was delivered to his care . Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself . John Thorpe , who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses , soon joined them , and from him she directly received the amends which were her due ; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella , on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow . He was a stout young man of middling height , who , with a plain face and ungraceful form , seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom , and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil , and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy . He took out his watch : “
12280	12281	12282	12282	I	0	” “
12289	12302	12282	12282	I	0	” Her brother told her that it was twenty - three miles . “
12308	12312	12282	12282	I	0	” cried Thorpe , “
12324	12356	12357	12357	I	0	” Morland remonstrated , pleaded the authority of road - books , innkeepers , and milestones ; but his friend disregarded them all ; he had a surer test of distance . “
12368	12372	12357	12357	I	0	” said he , “
12435	12436	12437	12437	You	424	” “
12443	12447	12437	12437	You	424	” said Morland ; “
12459	12460	12437	12437	You	424	” “
12513	12528	12500	12500	you	424	” ( The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off . ) “
12560	12561	12562	12562	He	426	” “
12574	12575	12562	12562	He	426	” “
12827	12828	12829	12829	I	0	” “
12839	12840	12829	12829	I	0	” “
12904	12905	12907	12907	I	0	” “
12911	12915	12907	12907	I	0	” said Catherine , “
12935	12936	12907	12907	I	0	” “
12965	12966	12961	12961	Freeman	118	” “
12976	12983	12974	12974	you	0	” said Catherine , quite pleased . “
13011	13174	13175	13175	You	436	” An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies ; and , on finding whither they were going , it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar ’s Buildings , and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe . James and Isabella led the way ; and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot , so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother ’s friend , and her friend ’s brother , so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings , that , though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street , she was so far from seeking to attract their notice , that she looked back at them only three times . John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine , and , after a few minutes ’ silence , renewed the conversation about his gig . “
13228	13229	13220	13220	Morland	86	” “
13232	13240	13220	13220	Morland	86	” said Morland , who overheard this ; “
13250	13251	13252	13252	My	0	” “
13283	13284	13273	13273	you	436	” “
13308	13309	13301	13301	I	0	” “
13326	13327	13316	13316	I	0	” “
13331	13351	13329	13329	you	436	” said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer . “
13363	13364	13366	13366	you	436	” “
13376	13377	13380	13380	he	439	” “
13431	13432	13434	13434	you	436	” “
13437	13443	13434	13434	you	436	” said Catherine very seriously . “
13452	13453	13434	13434	you	436	” “
13483	13484	13479	13479	I	0	” “
13491	13498	13499	13499	My	0	” cried Isabella , turning round . “
13524	13525	13509	13509	I	0	” “
13562	13694	13555	13555	morland	76	” This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two ; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result . Her companion ’s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met ; and Catherine , after listening and agreeing as long as she could , with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind , fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self - assured man , especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned , ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts ; it was , “
13704	13705	13706	13706	Udolpho	110	” “
13727	13749	13720	13720	I	0	” Catherine , humbled and ashamed , was going to apologize for her question , but he prevented her by saying , “
13799	13800	13801	13801	I	0	” “
13821	13822	13824	13824	I	0	” “
13862	13863	13868	13869	Mrs. Radcliffe	123	” “
13871	13886	13868	13869	Mrs. Radcliffe	123	” said Catherine , with some hesitation , from the fear of mortifying him . “
13930	13931	13936	13936	Camilla	108	” “
13938	13939	13936	13936	Camilla	108	” “
14020	14021	14022	14022	I	0	” “
14028	14029	14022	14022	I	0	” “
14077	14143	14146	14146	Mother	124	” This critique , the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine , brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe ’s lodgings , and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son , as they met Mrs. Thorpe , who had descried them from above , in the passage . “
14153	14166	14146	14146	Mother	124	” said he , giving her a hearty shake of the hand . “
14214	14443	14450	14450	you	76	” And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother ’s heart , for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection . On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness , for he asked each of them how they did , and observed that they both looked very ugly . These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening . Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen ’s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , “
14456	14480	14454	14454	Thorpe	99	” instead of answering , as she probably would have done , had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case , “
14489	14494	14454	14454	Thorpe	99	” she directly replied , “
14506	14507	14501	14501	he	99	” “
14549	14550	14541	14541	you	76	” “
14560	14561	14557	14557	Isabella	109	” “
14648	14655	14620	14620	She	109	” taking her hand with affection , “
14661	14662	14620	14620	She	109	” “
14667	14671	14664	14664	I	0	” she replied ; “
14704	14705	14695	14695	you	76	” “
14777	14778	14775	14775	she	109	” “
14798	14799	14803	14803	he	85	” “
14873	14874	14860	14861	the Allens	106	” “
14918	14941	14944	14944	Catherine	76	” James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “
14951	15358	15359	15359	I	0	” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet . A pre - engagement in Edgar ’s Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend , and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other . The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted , Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised , restless , and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho , lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner , incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen ’s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker , and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity , in being already engaged for the evening . CHAPTER 8 In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker , however , the party from Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time . The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them ; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste , of admiring the set of her gown , and envying the curl of her hair , they followed their chaperons , arm in arm , into the ballroom , whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred , and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection . The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated ; and James , who had been engaged quite as long as his sister , was very importunate with Isabella to stand up ; but John was gone into the card - room to speak to a friend , and nothing , she declared , should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too . “
15363	15367	15359	15359	I	0	” said she , “
15395	15438	15439	15441	My dear creature	473	” Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude , and they continued as they were for three minutes longer , when Isabella , who had been talking to James on the other side of her , turned again to his sister and whispered , “
15491	15528	15471	15471	I	0	” Catherine , though a little disappointed , had too much good nature to make any opposition , and the others rising up , Isabella had only time to press her friend ’s hand and say , “
15537	16069	15471	15471	I	0	” before they hurried off . The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing , Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen , between whom she now remained . She could not help being vexed at the non - appearance of Mr. Thorpe , for she not only longed to be dancing , but was likewise aware that , as the real dignity of her situation could not be known , she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner . To be disgraced in the eye of the world , to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity , her actions all innocence , and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement , is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine ’s life , and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character . Catherine had fortitude too ; she suffered , but no murmur passed her lips . From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance . He looked as handsome and as lively as ever , and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing - looking young woman , who leant on his arm , and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister ; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever , by being married already . But guided only by what was simple and probable , it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married ; he had not behaved , he had not talked , like the married men to whom she had been used ; he had never mentioned a wife , and he had acknowledged a sister . From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister ’s now being by his side ; and therefore , instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen ’s bosom , Catherine sat erect , in the perfect use of her senses , and with cheeks only a little redder than usual . Mr. Tilney and his companion , who continued , though slowly , to approach , were immediately preceded by a lady , an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe ; and this lady stopping to speak to her , they , as belonging to her , stopped likewise , and Catherine , catching Mr. Tilney ’s eye , instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition . She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged . “
16091	16124	16127	16127	sir	285	” He thanked her for her fears , and said that he had quitted it for a week , on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her . “
16225	16226	16209	16209	I	0	” “
16252	16253	16264	16264	he	85	” “
16289	16290	16272	16273	Dr. Skinner	125	” “
16298	16299	16302	16302	sir	285	” “
16331	16671	16318	16319	Mr. Allen	85	” Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen , that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats , as they had agreed to join their party . This was accordingly done , Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them ; and after a few minutes ’ consideration , he asked Catherine to dance with him . This compliment , delightful as it was , produced severe mortification to the lady ; and in giving her denial , she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it , that had Thorpe , who joined her just afterwards , been half a minute earlier , he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute . The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot ; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up , of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left , and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them , interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney . Of her dear Isabella , to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman , she could see nothing . They were in different sets . She was separated from all her party , and away from all her acquaintance ; one mortification succeeded another , and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson , that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady . From such a moralizing strain as this , she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder , and turning round , perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her , attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman . “
16680	16684	16674	16674	your	491	” said she , “
16722	17047	16703	16703	she	98	” Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine . The young ladies were introduced to each other , Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness , Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation ; and Mrs. Hughes , satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge , returned to her party . Miss Tilney had a good figure , a pretty face , and a very agreeable countenance ; and her air , though it had not all the decided pretension , the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe ’s , had more real elegance . Her manners showed good sense and good breeding ; they were neither shy nor affectedly open ; and she seemed capable of being young , attractive , and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her , and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence . Catherine , interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney , was desirous of being acquainted with her , and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say , and had courage and leisure for saying it . But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy , by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites , prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance , by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath , how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country , whether she drew , or played , or sang , and whether she was fond of riding on horseback . The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella , who in great spirits exclaimed , “
17095	17096	17097	17097	My	0	” “
17121	17122	17112	17112	I	0	” “
17212	17213	17201	17201	You	76	” “
17227	17237	17201	17201	You	76	” whispered Catherine , detaching her friend from James . “
17245	17246	17240	17241	Mr. Tilney	95	” “
17327	17328	17320	17320	We	506	” “
17342	17343	17320	17320	We	506	” “
17391	17392	17379	17379	you	105	” “
17405	17406	17402	17402	you	105	” “
17458	17535	17536	17536	I	0	” In this commonplace chatter , which lasted some time , the original subject seemed entirely forgotten ; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while , she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella ’s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney . When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance , James would have led his fair partner away , but she resisted . “
17543	17547	17536	17536	I	0	” she cried , “
17627	17628	17630	17630	my	0	” “
17633	17637	17630	17630	my	0	” said James , “
17651	17652	17657	17657	you	0	” “
17714	17715	17694	17694	him	474	” “
17735	17736	17729	17729	you	76	” “
17739	17743	17729	17729	you	76	” cried Isabella , “
17799	17889	17787	17787	Catherine	76	” And off they went , to regain their former place . John Thorpe , in the meanwhile , had walked away ; and Catherine , ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once , made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could , in the hope of finding him still with them — a hope which , when it proved to be fruitless , she felt to have been highly unreasonable . “
17895	17907	17787	17787	Catherine	76	” said Mrs. Thorpe , impatient for praise of her son , “
17917	17918	17913	17915	an agreeable partner	523	” “
17924	17925	17922	17922	madam	279	” “
17941	17942	17939	17939	he	99	” “
17952	17957	17962	17962	he	99	” said Mrs. Allen . “
17964	17965	17966	17966	He	99	” “
18007	18008	17996	17996	he	99	” “
18014	18040	17996	17996	he	99	” said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . “
18058	18072	18051	18051	he	99	” said Mrs. Allen ; and after a short silence , she added , “
18081	18082	18084	18084	he	99	” “
18090	18098	18087	18088	Mrs. Allen	88	” said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; “
18125	18165	18169	18169	she	529	” This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment ’s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , “
18178	18227	18169	18169	she	529	” Catherine was disappointed and vexed . She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view ; and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply , when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said , “
18248	18249	18237	18237	I	0	” “
18284	18285	18288	18288	you	86	” “
18335	18428	18325	18325	I	0	” Again Catherine excused herself ; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself . The rest of the evening she found very dull ; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea , to attend that of his partner ; Miss Tilney , though belonging to it , did not sit near her , and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile , one squeeze , and one “
18432	18855	18430	18430	Catherine	76	” CHAPTER 9 The progress of Catherine ’s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows . It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her , while she remained in the rooms , which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home . This , on arriving in Pulteney Street , took the direction of extraordinary hunger , and when that was appeased , changed into an earnest longing to be in bed ; such was the extreme point of her distress ; for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours , and from which she awoke perfectly revived , in excellent spirits , with fresh hopes and fresh schemes . The first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney , and almost her first resolution , to seek her for that purpose , in the pump - room at noon . In the pump - room , one so newly arrived in Bath must be met with , and that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence , and the completion of female intimacy , so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence , that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls . Her plan for the morning thus settled , she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast , resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one ; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen , whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such , that as she never talked a great deal , so she could never be entirely silent ; and , therefore , while she sat at her work , if she lost her needle or broke her thread , if she heard a carriage in the street , or saw a speck upon her gown , she must observe it aloud , whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not . At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , “
18963	18964	18955	18955	They	353	” “
18970	18974	18955	18955	They	353	” said Catherine . “
18982	18983	18955	18955	They	353	” “
19021	19022	19011	19011	you	86	” “
19032	19044	19011	19011	you	86	” said Catherine , looking at Mrs. Allen for her opinion ; “
19053	19054	19047	19047	I	0	” “
19080	19185	19192	19192	you	86	” Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer . “
19211	19212	19216	19216	you	86	” “
19222	19299	19216	19216	you	86	” replied Mrs. Allen , with the most placid indifference . Catherine took the advice , and ran off to get ready . In a very few minutes she reappeared , having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise , after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen ’s admiration of his gig ; and then receiving her friend ’s parting good wishes , they both hurried downstairs . “
19304	19325	19216	19216	you	86	” cried Isabella , to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage , “
19376	19398	19403	19403	she	374	” Catherine followed her orders and turned away , but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James , “
19412	19413	19406	19406	i	0	” “
19423	19433	19414	19414	You	253	” said Thorpe , as he handed her in , “
19495	19578	19822	19822	he	127	” Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one , but it was too late to retreat , and she was too young to own herself frightened ; so , resigning herself to her fate , and trusting to the animal ’s boasted knowledge of its owner , she sat peaceably down , and saw Thorpe sit down by her . Everything being then arranged , the servant who stood at the horse ’s head was bid in an important voice “
19584	19810	19822	19822	he	127	” and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable , without a plunge or a caper , or anything like one . Catherine , delighted at so happy an escape , spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise ; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins , and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip . Catherine , though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse , he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks , congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman ; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner , without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity , and ( considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour ) by no means alarmingly fast , gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind , in a fine mild day of February , with the consciousness of safety . A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue ; it was broken by Thorpe ’s saying very abruptly , “
19824	19841	19822	19822	he	127	” Catherine did not understand him — and he repeated his question , adding in explanation , “
19851	19852	19842	19843	Old Allen	127	” “
19872	19873	19867	19867	he	127	” “
19880	19881	19864	19864	I	0	” “
19887	19888	19864	19864	I	0	” “
19908	19909	19906	19906	he	127	” “
19915	19916	19906	19906	he	127	” “
19926	19927	19918	19918	you	88	” “
19933	19934	19918	19918	you	88	” “
19982	19983	19974	19974	he	127	” “
20018	20019	20008	20008	you	88	” “
20091	20092	20093	20093	I	0	” “
20099	20100	20093	20093	I	0	” “
20138	20139	20132	20132	Our	565	” “
20157	20158	20132	20132	Our	565	” “
20285	20286	20239	20239	Mine	0	” “
20295	20300	20239	20239	Mine	0	” said Catherine warmly , “
20332	20566	20567	20567	You	572	” This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply , of which no part was very distinct , except the frequent exclamations , amounting almost to oaths , which adorned it , and Catherine was left , when it ended , with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford , and the same happy conviction of her brother ’s comparative sobriety . Thorpe ’s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage , and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along , and the ease which his paces , as well as the excellence of the springs , gave the motion of the carriage . She followed him in all his admiration as well as she could . To go before or beyond him was impossible . His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject , his rapidity of expression , and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power ; she could strike out nothing new in commendation , but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert , and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in England , his carriage the neatest , his horse the best goer , and himself the best coachman . “
20576	20602	20567	20567	You	572	” said Catherine , venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided , and to offer some little variation on the subject , “
20611	20612	20573	20574	Mr. Thorpe	120	” “
20715	20716	20699	20699	I	0	” “
20720	20727	20699	20699	I	0	” cried Catherine , quite frightened . “
20772	20773	20753	20754	Mr. Thorpe	120	” “
20875	21475	20855	20855	i	0	” Catherine listened with astonishment ; she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing ; for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle , nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead . Her own family were plain , matter - of - fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind ; her father , at the utmost , being contented with a pun , and her mother with a proverb ; they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance , or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next . She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity , and was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject ; but she checked herself , because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights , in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous ; and , joining to this , the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them , she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe , and therefore would alarm herself no longer . By him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten ; and all the rest of his conversation , or rather talk , began and ended with himself and his own concerns . He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums ; of racing matches , in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner ; of shooting parties , in which he had killed more birds ( though without having one good shot ) than all his companions together ; and described to her some famous day ’s sport , with the fox - hounds , in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman , and in which the boldness of his riding , though it had never endangered his own life for a moment , had been constantly leading others into difficulties , which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many . Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself , and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be , she could not entirely repress a doubt , while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit , of his being altogether completely agreeable . It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure . When they arrived at Mrs. Allen ’s door , the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed , on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house : “
21480	21729	20855	20855	i	0	” It was inconceivable , incredible , impossible ! and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother ’s , nor the servant ’s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend ’s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer . Her own feelings entirely engrossed her ; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home . It was ages since she had had a moment ’s conversation with her dearest Catherine ; and , though she had such thousands of things to say to her , it appeared as if they were never to be together again ; so , with smiles of most exquisite misery , and the laughing eye of utter despondency , she bade her friend adieu and went on . Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , “
21739	21753	21736	21736	you	253	” a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; “
21764	21765	21755	21755	I	0	” “
21783	21784	21790	21790	she	98	” “
21799	21800	21790	21790	she	98	” “
21809	21810	21804	21805	Mrs. Thorpe	98	” “
21864	21865	21843	21843	She	98	” “
21875	21876	21867	21867	you	253	” “
21905	21906	21908	21908	you	253	” “
21918	21919	21913	21913	they	587	” “
21978	21979	21966	21967	Mrs. Hughes	126	” “
21989	21990	21983	21983	she	126	” “
22005	22006	21998	21998	she	126	” “
22019	22020	22023	22023	she	126	” “
22106	22107	22093	22094	Mrs. Hughes	126	” “
22117	22118	22123	22123	they	596	” “
22207	22208	22189	22190	Miss Tilney	92	” “
22221	22222	22211	22212	Mr. Tilney	95	” “
22265	22437	22254	22255	Mrs. Hughes	126	” Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister . Could she have foreseen such a circumstance , nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others ; and , as it was , she could only lament her ill luck , and think over what she had lost , till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable . CHAPTER 10 The Allens , Thorpes , and Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre ; and , as Catherine and Isabella sat together , there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them . “
22453	22468	22444	22444	Catherine	76	” was her address on Catherine ’s entering the box and sitting by her . “
22474	22486	22471	22472	Mr. Morland	105	” for he was close to her on the other side , “
22688	22689	22686	22686	him	95	” “
22692	22696	22686	22686	him	95	” said Catherine , “
22709	22710	22722	22722	him	95	” “
22868	22869	22856	22856	you	76	” “
22877	22878	22882	22882	you	76	” “
22945	22946	22948	22948	you	76	” “
22980	23461	22969	22969	I	0	” Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to James . Catherine ’s resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning ; and till the usual moment of going to the pump - room , she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention . But nothing of that kind occurred , no visitors appeared to delay them , and they all three set off in good time for the pump - room , where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place ; Mr. Allen , after drinking his glass of water , joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers ; and the ladies walked about together , noticing every new face , and almost every new bonnet in the room . The female part of the Thorpe family , attended by James Morland , appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour , and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend . James , who was now in constant attendance , maintained a similar position , and separating themselves from the rest of their party , they walked in that manner for some time , till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which , confining her entirely to her friend and brother , gave her very little share in the notice of either . They were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute , but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices , and their vivacity attended with so much laughter , that though Catherine ’s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other , she was never able to give any , from not having heard a word of the subject . At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend , by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney , whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs. Hughes , and whom she instantly joined , with a firmer determination to be acquainted , than she might have had courage to command , had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before . Miss Tilney met her with great civility , returned her advances with equal goodwill , and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room ; and though in all probability not an observation was made , nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before , under that roof , in every Bath season , yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth , and without personal conceit , might be something uncommon . “
23468	23492	23493	23493	Henry	95	” was an artless exclamation of Catherine ’s towards the close of their conversation , which at once surprised and amused her companion . “
23495	23502	23493	23493	Henry	95	” she replied with a smile . “
23511	23512	23513	23513	He	95	” “
23551	23558	23548	23549	Mr. Thorpe	120	” Miss Tilney could only bow . “
23564	23573	23548	23549	Mr. Thorpe	120	” added Catherine after a moment ’s silence , “
23594	23595	23583	23583	I	0	” “
23626	23627	23617	23617	He	95	” “
23666	23667	23663	23664	Miss Smith	132	” “
23676	23677	23673	23674	Mrs. Hughes	126	” “
23694	23695	23689	23689	you	623	” “
23699	23700	23689	23689	you	623	” “
23713	23714	23701	23701	He	95	” “
23730	23748	23720	23720	he	95	” Mrs. Hughes now joined them , and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to go . “
23762	23766	23751	23751	I	0	” said Catherine . “
23778	23779	23768	23768	you	623	” “
23791	23792	23793	23793	I	0	” “
23806	24390	23793	23793	I	0	” This civility was duly returned ; and they parted — on Miss Tilney ’s side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance ’s feelings , and on Catherine ’s , without the smallest consciousness of having explained them . She went home very happy . The morning had answered all her hopes , and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation , the future good . What gown and what head - dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern . She can not be justified in it . Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction , and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim . Catherine knew all this very well ; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before ; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin , and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening . This would have been an error in judgment , great though not uncommon , from which one of the other sex rather than her own , a brother rather than a great aunt , might have warned her , for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown . It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies , could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire ; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin , and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted , the sprigged , the mull , or the jackonet . Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone . No man will admire her the more , no woman will like her the better for it . Neatness and fashion are enough for the former , and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter . But not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine . She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before . She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe , and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight , lest he should engage her again ; for though she could not , dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to dance , her wishes , hopes , and plans all centred in nothing less . Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment , for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation . All have been , or at least all have believed themselves to be , in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid ; and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please . As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes , Catherine ’s agony began ; she fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her , hid herself as much as possible from his view , and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him . The cotillions were over , the country - dancing beginning , and she saw nothing of the Tilneys . “
24400	24404	24398	24398	Catherine	76	” whispered Isabella , “
24473	24694	24465	24465	he	99	” Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer . The others walked away , John Thorpe was still in view , and she gave herself up for lost . That she might not appear , however , to observe or expect him , she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan ; and a self - condemnation for her folly , in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time , had just passed through her mind , when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance , by Mr. Tilney himself . With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request , and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set , may be easily imagined . To escape , and , as she believed , so narrowly escape John Thorpe , and to be asked , so immediately on his joining her , asked by Mr. Tilney , as if he had sought her on purpose!—it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity . Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place , however , when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe , who stood behind her . “
24700	24704	24697	24698	Miss Morland	86	” said he . “
24722	24723	24724	24724	I	0	” “
24737	24738	24732	24732	you	86	” “

24894	24895	24900	24900	they	639	” “
24921	24927	24928	24928	Tilney	95	” Catherine satisfied his curiosity . “
24930	24934	24935	24935	Hum	135	” he repeated . “
25098	25141	25142	25143	That gentleman	2081	” This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine ’s attention , for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies . Her partner now drew near , and said , “
25270	25271	25273	25273	they	660	” “
25280	25281	25273	25273	they	660	” “
25293	25294	25273	25273	they	660	” “

26314	26322	26328	26329	Mrs. Allen	88	” Mr. Tilney was very much amused . “
26331	26335	26328	26329	Mrs. Allen	88	” he repeated . “
26377	26378	26360	26360	You	0	” “
26500	26501	26503	26511	those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort	721	” “
26562	26706	26710	26710	you	728	” Here their conversation closed , the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention . Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set , Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers - on , immediately behind her partner . He was a very handsome man , of a commanding aspect , past the bloom , but not past the vigour of life ; and with his eye still directed towards her , she saw him presently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper . Confused by his notice , and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance , she turned away her head . But while she did so , the gentleman retreated , and her partner , coming nearer , said , “
26742	26748	26736	26737	General Tilney	139	” Catherine ’s answer was only “
26749	26753	26739	26740	my father	629	Oh!”—but it was an “
26756	26795	26739	26740	my father	629	” expressing everything needful : attention to his words , and perfect reliance on their truth . With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the General , as he moved through the crowd , and “
26803	26905	26906	26906	I	0	” was her secret remark . In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded , a new source of felicity arose to her . She had never taken a country walk since her arrival in Bath . Miss Tilney , to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar , spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too ; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her , it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk , some morning or other . “
26911	26915	26906	26906	I	0	” she cried , “
26938	26983	26736	26737	General Tilney	139	” This was readily agreed to , with only a proviso of Miss Tilney ’s , that it did not rain , which Catherine was sure it would not . At twelve o’clock , they were to call for her in Pulteney Street ; and “
26989	27192	27193	27193	She	734	” was her parting speech to her new friend . Of her other , her older , her more established friend , Isabella , of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight ’s experience , she scarcely saw anything during the evening . Yet , though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness , she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen , which took them rather early away , and her spirits danced within her , as she danced in her chair all the way home . CHAPTER 11 The morrow brought a very sober - looking morning , the sun making only a few efforts to appear , and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes . A bright morning so early in the year , she allowed , would generally turn to rain , but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced . She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes , but Mr. Allen , not having his own skies and barometer about him , declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine . She applied to Mrs. Allen , and Mrs. Allen ’s opinion was more positive . “
27222	27246	27193	27193	She	734	” At about eleven o’clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine ’s watchful eye , and “
27259	27269	27251	27251	I	0	” broke from her in a most desponding tone . “
27277	27282	27270	27270	I	0	” said Mrs. Allen . “
27291	27295	27270	27270	I	0	” sighed Catherine ; “
27312	27313	27251	27251	I	0	” “
27330	27331	27251	27251	I	0	” “
27344	27345	27339	27339	I	0	” “
27348	27355	27339	27339	I	0	” replied her friend very placidly , “
27363	27369	27339	27339	I	0	” After a short pause , “
27377	27389	27339	27339	I	0	” said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window . “
27407	27408	27417	27417	I	0	” “
27425	27426	27417	27417	I	0	” “
27445	27446	27434	27434	I	0	” “
27465	27466	27467	27467	Anybody	216	” “
27543	27598	27599	27599	You	0	” The rain continued — fast , though not heavy . Catherine went every five minutes to the clock , threatening on each return that , if it still kept on raining another five minutes , she would give up the matter as hopeless . The clock struck twelve , and it still rained . “
27610	27611	27599	27599	You	0	” “
27707	27800	27915	27915	they	747	” At half past twelve , when Catherine ’s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment , the sky began voluntarily to clear . A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise ; she looked round ; the clouds were parting , and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance . Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed , and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen , who had “
27808	27902	27903	27903	Isabella	103	” But whether Catherine might still expect her friends , whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture , must yet be a question . It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back . “
27943	27981	27937	27938	Miss Tilney	92	” Mrs. Allen agreed to it . John Thorpe was soon with them , and his voice was with them yet sooner , for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick . “
27988	27996	27937	27938	Miss Tilney	92	” as he threw open the door . “
28025	28026	28022	28023	Mrs. Allen	88	” “
28064	28099	28100	28100	My	0	” This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all ; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him , and the two others walked in , to give their assistance . “
28242	28243	28244	28244	I	0	” “
28254	28258	28259	28259	You	754	” said Morland . “
28263	28267	28259	28261	You croaking fellow	755	” cried Thorpe . “
28306	28307	28301	28301	she	325	” “
28311	28315	28301	28301	she	325	” cried Catherine . “
28320	28321	28301	28301	she	325	” “
28338	28339	28301	28301	she	325	” “
28352	28353	28301	28301	she	325	” “

28379	28380	28367	28367	one	305	” “

28437	28447	28427	28427	you	0	because”—looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella ’s smile—“I
28493	28494	28496	28496	they	767	” “
28499	28503	28496	28496	they	767	” cried Thorpe ; “
28527	28528	28518	28518	he	355	” “
28535	28536	28541	28541	he	355	” “

28642	28643	28646	28646	they	772	” “
28689	28694	28695	28695	My	0	” Isabella corroborated it : “
28722	28723	28724	28724	I	0	” “
28754	28755	28807	28807	Tilney	92	” “
28765	28766	28807	28807	Tilney	92	” “
28791	28792	28794	28794	yourself	76	” “
28830	28831	28807	28807	Tilney	92	” “
28843	28844	28840	28841	Mrs. Allen	88	” “
28853	28854	28840	28841	Mrs. Allen	88	” “
28865	28879	28858	28858	you	88	” was the general cry . Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : “
28885	28889	28840	28841	Mrs. Allen	88	” said she , “
28894	29155	28891	28891	you	253	” And in two minutes they were off . Catherine ’s feelings , as she got into the carriage , were in a very unsettled state ; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure , and the hope of soon enjoying another , almost its equal in degree , however unlike in kind . She could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by her , in so readily giving up their engagement , without sending her any message of excuse . It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk ; and , in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour , she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience . To feel herself slighted by them was very painful . On the other hand , the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho , as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be , was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything . They passed briskly down Pulteney Street , and through Laura Place , without the exchange of many words . Thorpe talked to his horse , and she meditated , by turns , on broken promises and broken arches , phaetons and false hangings , Tilneys and trap - doors . As they entered Argyle Buildings , however , she was roused by this address from her companion , “
29171	29172	29158	29169	that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by	782	” “
29177	29178	29186	29186	she	782	” “
29195	29225	29186	29186	she	782	” Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother ’s arm , walking slowly down the street . She saw them both looking back at her . “
29233	29238	29230	29231	Mr. Thorpe	120	” she impatiently cried ; “
29272	29347	29261	29261	I	0	” But to what purpose did she speak ? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot ; the Tilneys , who had soon ceased to look after her , were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place , and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace . Still , however , and during the length of another street , she entreated him to stop . “
29376	29435	29373	29374	Miss Tilney	92	” But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit . Her reproaches , however , were not spared . “
29550	29820	29541	29541	you	120	” Thorpe defended himself very stoutly , declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life , and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself . Their drive , even when this subject was over , was not likely to be very agreeable . Catherine ’s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing . She listened reluctantly , and her replies were short . Blaize Castle remained her only comfort ; towards _ that _ , she still looked at intervals with pleasure ; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk , and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys , she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply — the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms , exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture , though now for many years deserted — the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow , winding vaults , by a low , grated door ; or even of having their lamp , their only lamp , extinguished by a sudden gust of wind , and of being left in total darkness . In the meanwhile , they proceeded on their journey without any mischance , and were within view of the town of Keynsham , when a halloo from Morland , who was behind them , made his friend pull up , to know what was the matter . The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , “
29909	29910	29894	29894	We	789	” “
29918	29939	29894	29894	We	789	” replied Thorpe rather angrily ; and instantly turning his horse , they were on their way back to Bath . “
29955	29961	29894	29894	We	789	” said he soon afterwards , “
30022	30023	30026	30026	he	76	” “
30030	30035	30026	30026	he	76	” said Catherine warmly , “
30046	30047	30040	30040	he	76	” “
30056	30057	30040	30040	he	76	” “
30065	30066	30040	30040	he	76	” “
30073	30074	30075	30075	Nobody	396	” “
30083	30304	30305	30305	I	0	” Thorpe then said something in the loud , incoherent way to which he had often recourse , about its being a d — — thing to be miserly ; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things , he did not know who could , which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand . Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment , she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so ; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words . As she entered the house , the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off ; that , when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe , the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her ; and on his saying no , had felt for a card , but said she had none about her , and went away . Pondering over these heart - rending tidings , Catherine walked slowly upstairs . At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “
30331	30408	30410	30410	I	0	” They all spent the evening together at Thorpe ’s . Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton . Her satisfaction , too , in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once . “
30563	30603	30555	30555	you	105	” Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered . “
30614	30618	30619	30619	You	105	” she whispered . “
30742	30800	30801	30802	Mrs. Allen	88	” And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch , which is the true heroine ’s portion ; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears . And lucky may she think herself , if she get another good night ’s rest in the course of the next three months . CHAPTER 12 “
30804	30811	30801	30802	Mrs. Allen	88	” said Catherine the next morning , “
30838	30839	30833	30833	I	0	” “
30862	31449	30856	30857	Miss Tilney	92	” Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney ’s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen ’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . To Milsom Street she was directed , and having made herself perfect in the number , hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit , explain her conduct , and be forgiven ; tripping lightly through the church - yard , and resolutely turning away her eyes , that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family , who , she had reason to believe , were in a shop hard by . She reached the house without any impediment , looked at the number , knocked at the door , and inquired for Miss Tilney . The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home , but was not quite certain . Would she be pleased to send up her name ? She gave her card . In a few minutes the servant returned , and with a look which did not quite confirm his words , said he had been mistaken , for that Miss Tilney was walked out . Catherine , with a blush of mortification , left the house . She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _ was _ at home , and too much offended to admit her ; and as she retired down the street , could not withhold one glance at the drawing - room windows , in expectation of seeing her there , but no one appeared at them . At the bottom of the street , however , she looked back again , and then , not at a window , but issuing from the door , she saw Miss Tilney herself . She was followed by a gentleman , whom Catherine believed to be her father , and they turned up towards Edgar ’s Buildings . Catherine , in deep mortification , proceeded on her way . She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility ; but she checked the resentful sensation ; she remembered her own ignorance . She knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness , to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead , nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable . Dejected and humbled , she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night ; but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance , for she soon recollected , in the first place , that she was without any excuse for staying at home ; and , in the second , that it was a play she wanted very much to see . To the theatre accordingly they all went ; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her ; she feared that , amongst the many perfections of the family , a fondness for plays was not to be ranked ; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage , which she knew , on Isabella ’s authority , rendered everything else of the kind “
31453	31861	30856	30857	Miss Tilney	92	” She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure ; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one , observing her during the first four acts , would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her . On the beginning of the fifth , however , the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father , joining a party in the opposite box , recalled her to anxiety and distress . The stage could no longer excite genuine merriment — no longer keep her whole attention . Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box ; and , for the space of two entire scenes , did she thus watch Henry Tilney , without being once able to catch his eye . No longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play ; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes . At length , however , he did look towards her , and he bowed — but such a bow ! no smile , no continued observance attended it ; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction . Catherine was restlessly miserable ; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation . Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her ; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation — instead of proudly resolving , in conscious innocence , to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it , to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation , and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight , or flirting with somebody else — she took to herself all the shame of misconduct , or at least of its appearance , and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause . The play concluded — the curtain fell — Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat , but his father remained , and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box . She was right ; in a few minutes he appeared , and , making his way through the then thinning rows , spoke with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend . Not with such calmness was he answered by the latter : “
31952	31953	31947	31947	I	0	” “
31962	32012	31957	31957	you	92	” was Mrs. Allen ’s reply . Her assurance , however , standing sole as it did , was not thrown away ; it brought a more cordial , more natural smile into his countenance , and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve : “
32047	32048	32036	32036	you	92	” “
32131	32183	32203	32203	she	813	” Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration ? Henry Tilney at least was not . With a yet sweeter smile , he said everything that need be said of his sister ’s concern , regret , and dependence on Catherine ’s honour . “
32195	32199	32203	32203	she	813	” cried Catherine , “
32254	32255	32256	32256	I	0	” “
32367	32404	32350	32350	She	813	” Catherine ’s mind was greatly eased by this information , yet a something of solicitude remained , from which sprang the following question , thoroughly artless in itself , though rather distressing to the gentleman : “
32453	32454	32455	32455	Me	0	” “
32461	32462	32455	32455	Me	0	” “
32483	32484	32479	32479	you	95	” “
32494	32495	32488	32488	i	0	” “
32511	32705	32502	32502	you	95	” He replied by asking her to make room for him , and talking of the play . He remained with them some time , and was only too agreeable for Catherine to be contented when he went away . Before they parted , however , it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible ; and , setting aside the misery of his quitting their box , she was , upon the whole , left one of the happiest creatures in the world . While talking to each other , she had observed with some surprise that John Thorpe , who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together , was engaged in conversation with General Tilney ; and she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse . What could they have to say of her ? She feared General Tilney did not like her appearance : she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter , rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes . “
32715	32823	32708	32709	Mr. Thorpe	120	” was her anxious inquiry , as she pointed them out to her companion . He knew nothing about it ; but his father , like every military man , had a very large acquaintance . When the entertainment was over , Thorpe came to assist them in getting out . Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry ; and , while they waited in the lobby for a chair , he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue , by asking , in a consequential manner , whether she had seen him talking with General Tilney : “
32871	32872	32854	32854	I	0	” “
32881	32882	32876	32876	you	0	” “
33070	33071	33060	33061	the General	2216	” “
33082	33083	33060	33061	the General	2216	” “
33090	33092	33095	33095	General	838	said?”—lowering his voice—“well
33107	33590	33098	33098	I	0	” Here Catherine , who was much less gratified by his admiration than by General Tilney ’s , was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen . Thorpe , however , would see her to her chair , and , till she entered it , continued the same kind of delicate flattery , in spite of her entreating him to have done . That General Tilney , instead of disliking , should admire her , was very delightful ; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet . The evening had done more , much more , for her than could have been expected . CHAPTER 13 Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , and Saturday have now passed in review before the reader ; the events of each day , its hopes and fears , mortifications and pleasures , have been separately stated , and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described , and close the week . The Clifton scheme had been deferred , not relinquished , and on the afternoon ’s Crescent of this day , it was brought forward again . In a private consultation between Isabella and James , the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going , and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her , it was agreed that , provided the weather were fair , the party should take place on the following morning ; and they were to set off very early , in order to be at home in good time . The affair thus determined , and Thorpe ’s approbation secured , Catherine only remained to be apprised of it . She had left them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney . In that interval the plan was completed , and as soon as she came again , her agreement was demanded ; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella , Catherine looked grave , was very sorry , but could not go . The engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now . She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk to - morrow ; it was quite determined , and she would not , upon any account , retract . But that she _ must _ and _ should _ retract , was instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes ; they must go to Clifton to - morrow , they would not go without her , it would be nothing to put off a mere walk for one day longer , and they would not hear of a refusal . Catherine was distressed , but not subdued . “
33610	33639	33605	33605	I	0	” This availed nothing . The same arguments assailed her again ; she must go , she should go , and they would not hear of a refusal . “
33672	33673	33596	33596	Isabella	103	” “
33695	33855	33856	33856	I	0	” But Isabella became only more and more urgent , calling on her in the most affectionate manner , addressing her by the most endearing names . She was sure her dearest , sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly . She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart , so sweet a temper , to be so easily persuaded by those she loved . But all in vain ; Catherine felt herself to be in the right , and though pained by such tender , such flattering supplication , could not allow it to influence her . Isabella then tried another method . She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney , though she had known her so little a while , than for her best and oldest friends , with being grown cold and indifferent , in short , towards herself . “
33952	34036	33943	33944	These Tilneys	133	” Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind . Was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others ? Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish , regardless of everything but her own gratification . These painful ideas crossed her mind , though she said nothing . Isabella , in the meanwhile , had applied her handkerchief to her eyes ; and Morland , miserable at such a sight , could not help saying , “
34077	34142	34065	34065	I	0	” This was the first time of her brother ’s openly siding against her , and anxious to avoid his displeasure , she proposed a compromise . If they would only put off their scheme till Tuesday , which they might easily do , as it depended only on themselves , she could go with them , and everybody might then be satisfied . But “
34149	34155	34065	34065	I	0	” was the immediate answer ; “
34176	34208	34162	34162	Thorpe	103	” Catherine was sorry , but could do no more ; and a short silence ensued , which was broken by Isabella , who in a voice of cold resentment said , “
34256	34257	34258	34258	Catherine	76	” “
34264	34268	34258	34258	Catherine	76	” said James . “
34293	34294	34282	34282	I	0	” “
34298	34302	34282	34282	I	0	” cried Thorpe , “
34348	34349	34338	34338	I	0	” “
34360	34444	34338	34338	I	0	” But her words were lost on Thorpe , who had turned abruptly away . The three others still continued together , walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine ; sometimes not a word was said , sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches , and her arm was still linked within Isabella ’s , though their hearts were at war . At one moment she was softened , at another irritated ; always distressed , but always steady . “
34457	34461	34455	34455	Catherine	76	” said James ; “
34486	34487	34473	34473	you	76	” “
34497	34504	34473	34473	you	76	” she replied , very feelingly ; “
34527	34528	34529	34529	I	0	” “
34532	34541	34529	34529	I	0	” said Isabella , in a low voice , “
34548	34593	34529	34529	I	0	” Catherine ’s heart swelled ; she drew away her arm , and Isabella made no opposition . Thus passed a long ten minutes , till they were again joined by Thorpe , who , coming to them with a gayer look , said , “
34628	34629	34630	34630	You	0	” “
34634	34638	34639	34639	I	0	” cried Catherine . “
34722	34742	34718	34718	mine	0	” Isabella ’s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour , and James too looked happy again . “
34775	34776	34718	34718	mine	0	” “
34782	34786	34787	34787	I	0	” said Catherine ; “
34806	34868	34794	34794	I	0	” Isabella , however , caught hold of one hand , Thorpe of the other , and remonstrances poured in from all three . Even James was quite angry . When everything was settled , when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well , it was quite ridiculous , quite absurd , to make any further objection . “
34960	34998	34953	34953	Isabella	103	” Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys ; they were turning the corner into Brock Street , when he had overtaken them , and were at home by this time . “
35006	35010	35000	35000	I	0	” said Catherine ; “
35047	35071	35087	35087	She	857	” And with these words she broke away and hurried off . Thorpe would have darted after her , but Morland withheld him . “
35085	35086	35087	35087	She	857	” “
35093	35464	35087	35087	She	857	” Thorpe never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere . As she walked , she reflected on what had passed . It was painful to her to disappoint and displease them , particularly to displease her brother ; but she could not repent her resistance . Setting her own inclination apart , to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney , to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before , and on a false pretence too , must have been wrong . She had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone , she had not consulted merely her own gratification ; _ that _ might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself , by seeing Blaize Castle ; no , she had attended to what was due to others , and to her own character in their opinion . Her conviction of being right , however , was not enough to restore her composure ; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not be at ease ; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent , she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of Milsom Street . So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the Tilneys ’ advantage in the outset , they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them ; and the servant still remaining at the open door , she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment , and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs . Then , opening the first door before her , which happened to be the right , she immediately found herself in the drawing - room with General Tilney , his son , and daughter . Her explanation , defective only in being — from her irritation of nerves and shortness of breath — no explanation at all , was instantly given . “
35519	35721	35508	35508	you	859	” The business , however , though not perfectly elucidated by this speech , soon ceased to be a puzzle . Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it . But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing . Whatever might have been felt before her arrival , her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire . The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on . To such anxious attention was the General ’s civility carried , that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house , he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself . “
35740	35903	35729	35729	He	102	” And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity . After sitting with them a quarter of an hour , she rose to take leave , and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney ’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her . Miss Tilney added her own wishes . Catherine was greatly obliged ; but it was quite out of her power . Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment . The General declared he could say no more ; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded ; but on some other day he trusted , when longer notice could be given , they would not refuse to spare her to her friend . “
35928	36171	35920	35920	she	862	” The General attended her himself to the street - door , saying everything gallant as they went downstairs , admiring the elasticity of her walk , which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing , and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld , when they parted . Catherine , delighted by all that had passed , proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street , walking , as she concluded , with great elasticity , though she had never thought of it before . She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party ; and now that she had been triumphant throughout , had carried her point , and was secure of her walk , she began ( as the flutter of her spirits subsided ) to doubt whether she had been perfectly right . A sacrifice was always noble ; and if she had given way to their entreaties , she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased , a brother angry , and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed , perhaps through her means . To ease her mind , and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been , she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half - settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day . Mr. Allen caught at it directly . “
36174	36178	35920	35920	she	862	” said he , “
36187	36188	36181	36181	you	863	” “
36222	36223	36220	36220	I	0	” “
36334	36335	36326	36326	you	863	” “
36390	36391	36394	36394	you	863	” “
36435	36436	36406	36406	you	863	” “
36456	36457	36448	36448	I	0	” “
36461	36465	36448	36448	I	0	” cried Catherine , “
36516	36517	36503	36503	you	875	” “
36609	36610	36599	36600	Young people	478	” “
36633	36634	36624	36624	you	875	” “
36649	36654	36624	36624	you	875	” said Mr. Allen ; “
36675	36676	36656	36656	I	0	” “
36687	36780	36681	36681	I	0	” added his wife . Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed . Mr. Allen , however , discouraged her from doing any such thing . “
36849	37108	37109	37109	I	0	” Catherine submitted , and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong , felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen ’s approbation of her own conduct , and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself . Her escape from being one of the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed ; for what would the Tilneys have thought of her , if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself , if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety , only to enable her to be guilty of another ? CHAPTER 14 The next morning was fair , and Catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party . With Mr. Allen to support her , she felt no dread of the event : but she would gladly be spared a contest , where victory itself was painful , and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them . The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time ; and no new difficulty arising , no sudden recollection , no unexpected summons , no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures , my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement , though it was made with the hero himself . They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff , that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in Bath . “
37115	37129	37109	37109	I	0	” said Catherine , as they walked along the side of the river , “
37138	37139	37140	37140	You	888	” “
37146	37154	37140	37140	You	888	” said Henry , a little surprised . “

38231	38236	38228	38228	you	95	” said Miss Tilney , “
38384	38385	38386	38386	You	95	” “
38532	38533	38513	38513	I	0	” “
38543	38547	38513	38513	I	0	” said Henry , “
38653	38654	38655	38655	You	935	” “
38757	38758	38736	38736	you	935	” “
38862	39502	38845	38846	Mrs. Radcliffe	123	” Catherine assented — and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady ’s merits closed the subject . The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say . They were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing , and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures , with all the eagerness of real taste . Here Catherine was quite lost . She knew nothing of drawing — nothing of taste : and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit , for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her . The little which she could understand , however , appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before . It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill , and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day . She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance . A misplaced shame . Where people wish to attach , they should always be ignorant . To come with a well - informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others , which a sensible person would always wish to avoid . A woman especially , if she have the misfortune of knowing anything , should conceal it as well as she can . The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author ; and to her treatment of the subject I will only add , in justice to men , that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex , imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms , there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance . But Catherine did not know her own advantages — did not know that a good - looking girl , with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind , can not fail of attracting a clever young man , unless circumstances are particularly untoward . In the present instance , she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge , declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw ; and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed , in which his instructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in everything admired by him , and her attention was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste . He talked of foregrounds , distances , and second distances — side - screens and perspectives — lights and shades ; and Catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff , she voluntarily rejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape . Delighted with her progress , and fearful of wearying her with too much wisdom at once , Henry suffered the subject to decline , and by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near its summit , to oaks in general , to forests , the enclosure of them , waste lands , crown lands and government , he shortly found himself arrived at politics ; and from politics , it was an easy step to silence . The general pause which succeeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine , who , in rather a solemn tone of voice , uttered these words , “
39518	39536	39584	39584	you	0	” Miss Tilney , to whom this was chiefly addressed , was startled , and hastily replied , “
39544	39545	39547	39547	I	0	” “
39577	39578	39558	39558	I	0	” “
39591	39592	39584	39584	you	0	” “
39627	39628	39629	39629	You	0	” “
39670	39671	39662	39662	government	945	” “
39674	39683	39662	39662	government	945	” said Henry , endeavouring not to smile , “
39706	39717	39721	39721	I	0	” The ladies stared . He laughed , and added , “
39824	39825	39826	39827	Miss Morland	86	” “
39849	39850	39833	39833	he	0	” “
39856	39857	39858	39858	My	0	” “
40096	40101	40086	40086	she	86	” Catherine looked grave . “
40107	40112	40122	40122	you	95	” said Miss Tilney , “
40168	40169	40158	40159	Miss Morland	86	” “
40183	40184	40170	40170	I	0	” “
40197	40198	40170	40170	I	0	” “
40205	40206	40207	40207	You	95	” “
40235	40236	40225	40225	you	95	” “
40273	40274	40240	40240	I	0	” “
40284	40285	40286	40287	Miss Morland	86	” “
40326	40327	40328	40328	We	978	” “
40384	40689	40362	40362	he	0	” It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never be wrong . His manner might sometimes surprise , but his meaning must always be just : and what she did not understand , she was almost as ready to admire , as what she did . The whole walk was delightful , and though it ended too soon , its conclusion was delightful too ; her friends attended her into the house , and Miss Tilney , before they parted , addressing herself with respectful form , as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine , petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next . No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen ’s side , and the only difficulty on Catherine ’s was in concealing the excess of her pleasure . The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection , for no thought of Isabella or James had crossed her during their walk . When the Tilneys were gone , she became amiable again , but she was amiable for some time to little effect ; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety ; she had heard nothing of any of them . Towards the end of the morning , however , Catherine , having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment ’s delay , walked out into the town , and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she was loitering towards Edgar ’s Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world , who had been her dear friends all the morning . From her , she soon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place . “
40698	40703	40690	40690	They	981	” said Miss Anne , “
40767	40783	40763	40763	John	99	” Catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement . “
40788	40793	40763	40763	John	99	” rejoined the other , “
40846	40860	40861	40861	I	0	” Catherine , a little doubtful of this , could not help answering , “
40879	40880	40882	40882	you	982	” “
40919	41328	40913	40913	Sophia	159	” Catherine was still unconvinced ; but glad that Anne should have the friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her , she bade her adieu without much uneasiness , and returned home , pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it , and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to resent her resistance any longer . CHAPTER 15 Early the next day , a note from Isabella , speaking peace and tenderness in every line , and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance , hastened Catherine , in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity , to Edgar ’s Buildings . The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour ; and , on Anne ’s quitting it to call her sister , Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday ’s party . Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it ; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world , that nobody could imagine how charming it had been , and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive . Such was the information of the first five minutes ; the second unfolded thus much in detail — that they had driven directly to the York Hotel , ate some soup , and bespoke an early dinner , walked down to the pump - room , tasted the water , and laid out some shillings in purses and spars ; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry - cook ’s , and hurrying back to the hotel , swallowed their dinner in haste , to prevent being in the dark ; and then had a delightful drive back , only the moon was not up , and it rained a little , and Mr. Morland ’s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along . Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction . It appeared that Blaize Castle had never been thought of ; and , as for all the rest , there was nothing to regret for half an instant . Maria ’s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne , whom she represented as insupportably cross , from being excluded the party . “
41409	41453	41478	41478	yours	76	” Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step , and a look of such happy importance , as engaged all her friend ’s notice . Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : “
41485	41496	41478	41478	yours	76	” Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance . “
41505	41510	41512	41512	yourself	76	” continued the other , “
41613	41648	41608	41608	I	0	” Catherine ’s understanding began to awake : an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind ; and , with the natural blush of so new an emotion , she cried out , “
41673	41873	41874	41874	You	1001	” This bold surmise , however , she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact . The anxious affection , which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella ’s every look and action , had , in the course of their yesterday ’s party , received the delightful confession of an equal love . Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James . Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest , wonder , and joy . Her brother and her friend engaged ! new to such circumstances , the importance of it appeared unspeakably great , and she contemplated it as one of those grand events , of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return . The strength of her feelings she could not express ; the nature of them , however , contented her friend . The happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion , and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy . Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did , in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations . “
41913	41923	41924	41924	You	1001	” This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine . “
41932	41936	41928	41930	your dear brother	1004	” continued Isabella , “
42031	42067	42068	42068	I	0	” Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love ; for , though exceedingly fond of her brother , and partial to all his endowments , she had never in her life thought him handsome . “
42211	42323	42208	42208	you	1009	” Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer ; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected , she dared no longer contest the point , nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her . Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella . Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son ’s wishes . “
42328	42332	42208	42208	you	1009	” said she , “
42358	42359	42360	42360	Morland	76	” “
42366	42370	42360	42360	Morland	76	” replied Isabella ; “
42401	42411	42393	42394	Your brother	474	” Here Catherine again discerned the force of love . “
42431	42432	42437	42437	Catherine	76	” “
42500	42543	42544	42544	I	0	” This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea . “
42551	42557	42544	42544	I	0	” was her frequent declaration ; “
42568	42569	42561	42561	they	1022	” “
42575	42579	42561	42561	they	1022	” said Isabella , “
42641	42642	42656	42656	You	76	” “
42645	42649	42656	42656	You	76	” cried Catherine . “
42662	42663	42656	42656	You	76	” “
42762	42922	42752	42752	I	0	” A reverie succeeded this conviction — and when Isabella spoke again , it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding - gown . Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself , who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire . Catherine wished to congratulate him , but knew not what to say , and her eloquence was only in her eyes . From them , however , the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively , and James could combine them with ease . Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home , his adieus were not long ; and they would have been yet shorter , had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go . Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone . “
42972	43127	42967	42967	I	0	” The two friends , with hearts now more united than ever , were inseparable for the day ; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along . Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland ’s consent , to consider Isabella ’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters . To Catherine ’s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their “
43131	43252	43253	43253	I	0	” ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute . Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress . But when it did come , where could distress be found ? “
43283	43376	43378	43378	John	99	” were the first three lines , and in one moment all was joyful security . The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella ’s features , all care and anxiety seemed removed , her spirits became almost too high for control , and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals . Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction . Her heart was overflowing with tenderness . It was “
43379	43381	43383	43383	Catherine	76	” and “
43384	43389	43391	43391	Anne	157	” at every word ; “
43395	43407	43383	43383	Catherine	76	” must immediately be made sharers in their felicity ; and two “
43409	43677	43378	43378	John	99	” at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned . John himself was no skulker in joy . He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world , but swore off many sentences in his praise . The letter , whence sprang all this felicity , was short , containing little more than this assurance of success ; and every particular was deferred till James could write again . But for particulars Isabella could well afford to wait . The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland ’s promise ; his honour was pledged to make everything easy ; and by what means their income was to be formed , whether landed property were to be resigned , or funded money made over , was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern . She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities . She saw herself at the end of a few weeks , the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton , the envy of every valued old friend in Putney , with a carriage at her command , a new name on her tickets , and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger . When the contents of the letter were ascertained , John Thorpe , who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London , prepared to set off . “
43683	43695	43680	43681	Miss Morland	86	” said he , on finding her alone in the parlour , “
43706	43740	43696	43696	I	0	” Catherine wished him a good journey . Without appearing to hear her , he walked to the window , fidgeted about , hummed a tune , and seemed wholly self - occupied . “
43749	43768	43743	43743	you	0	” said Catherine . He made no answer ; but after a minute ’s silence burst out with , “
43811	43812	43802	43802	I	0	” “
43824	43825	43827	43827	you	0	” “
43880	43881	43866	43866	I	0	” “
43897	43898	43884	43884	I	0	” “
43902	43909	43901	43901	you	0	know”—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh—“I
43927	43928	43930	43930	we	1033	” “
43962	43963	43946	43946	I	0	” “
44009	44010	43986	43986	I	0	” “
44020	44032	44014	44014	you	0	” replied Catherine — finding that he waited for an answer . “
44117	44118	44101	44101	you	0	” “
44147	44148	44150	44150	I	0	” “
44174	44175	44150	44150	I	0	” “
44191	44192	44182	44182	mother	206	” “
44214	44215	44204	44204	you	0	” “
44240	44241	44235	44235	Company	1042	” “
44324	44325	44327	44327	we	1046	” “
44365	44366	44358	44358	I	0	” “
44457	44458	44444	44444	she	1047	” “
44546	45135	44530	44530	We	1050	” And away she went . It was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer . With such news to communicate , and such a visit to prepare for , her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge ; and she hurried away , leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address , and her explicit encouragement . The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother ’s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen , by the communication of the wonderful event . How great was her disappointment ! the important affair , which many words of preparation ushered in , had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother ’s arrival ; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people ’s happiness , with a remark , on the gentleman ’s side , in favour of Isabella ’s beauty , and on the lady ’s , of her great good luck . It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility . The disclosure , however , of the great secret of James ’s going to Fullerton the day before , did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen . She could not listen to that with perfect calmness , but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment , wished she could have known his intention , wished she could have seen him before he went , as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother , and her kind compliments to all the Skinners . CHAPTER 16 Catherine ’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable ; and accordingly , though she was most politely received by General Tilney , and kindly welcomed by his daughter , though Henry was at home , and no one else of the party , she found , on her return , without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings , that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded . Instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney , from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him . It puzzled her to account for all this . It could not be General Tilney ’s fault . That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father . _ He _ could not be accountable for his children ’s want of spirits , or for her want of enjoyment in his company . The former she hoped at last might have been accidental , and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity . Isabella , on hearing the particulars of the visit , gave a different explanation : “
45211	45212	45222	45222	Isabella	103	” “
45234	45235	45229	45229	she	1051	” “
45282	45283	45272	45272	he	1055	” “
45299	45300	45291	45291	he	1055	” “
45337	45338	45331	45331	he	1055	” “
45351	45352	45345	45345	he	1055	” “
45390	45391	45383	45383	John	99	” “
45431	45432	45421	45421	his	1055	” “
45473	45474	45469	45469	John	99	” “
45496	45497	45477	45477	I	0	” “
45503	45504	45477	45477	I	0	” “
45518	45519	45511	45511	I	0	” “
45635	46212	46213	46213	Your	1065	” Isabella ’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend ; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister ; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts . The evening rewarded her confidence ; she was met by one with the same kindness , and by the other with the same attention , as heretofore : Miss Tilney took pains to be near her , and Henry asked her to dance . Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother , Captain Tilney , was expected almost every hour , she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable - looking , handsome young man , whom she had never seen before , and who now evidently belonged to their party . She looked at him with great admiration , and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother , though , in her eyes , his air was more assuming , and his countenance less prepossessing . His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior ; for , within her hearing , he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself , but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible . From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that , whatever might be our heroine ’s opinion of him , his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind ; not likely to produce animosities between the brothers , nor persecutions to the lady . _ He _ can not be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen ’s greatcoats , by whom she will hereafter be forced into a traveling - chaise and four , which will drive off with incredible speed . Catherine , meanwhile , undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil , or of any evil at all , except that of having but a short set to dance down , enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney , listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said ; and , in finding him irresistible , becoming so herself . At the end of the first dance , Captain Tilney came towards them again , and , much to Catherine ’s dissatisfaction , pulled his brother away . They retired whispering together ; and , though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm , and lay it down as fact , that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her , which he now hastened to communicate to his brother , in the hope of separating them forever , she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations . Her suspense was of full five minutes ’ duration ; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour , when they both returned , and an explanation was given , by Henry ’s requesting to know , if she thought her friend , Miss Thorpe , would have any objection to dancing , as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her . Catherine , without hesitation , replied that she was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all . The cruel reply was passed on to the other , and he immediately walked away . “
46223	46227	46213	46214	Your brother	474	” said she , “
46288	46295	46271	46271	he	474	” Henry smiled , and said , “
46314	46315	46320	46320	you	0	” “
46323	46324	46320	46320	you	0	” “

46553	46687	46688	46688	I	0	” Catherine blushed and disclaimed , and the gentleman ’s predictions were verified . There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across . Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled , the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given ; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine ’s comprehension , she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner . “
46705	46706	46697	46697	isabella	103	” “
46716	46717	46712	46712	her	103	” “

46845	46846	46838	46838	Isabella	103	” “
46905	46943	46944	46944	I	0	” The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “
46987	46988	46977	46977	I	0	” “
46995	46996	46993	46993	you	0	” “

47244	47245	47252	47252	he	419	” “
47317	47516	47303	47303	I	0	” When the young ladies next met , they had a far more interesting subject to discuss . James Morland ’s second letter was then received , and the kind intentions of his father fully explained . A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children . An estate of at least equal value , moreover , was assured as his future inheritance . James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude ; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry , being , however unwelcome , no more than he had expected , was borne by him without discontent . Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled . “
47523	47532	47303	47303	I	0	” said Isabella , with a grave face . “
47541	47554	47555	47555	I	0	” said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe , looking anxiously at her daughter . “
47645	47646	47632	47632	you	1096	” “
47706	47707	47708	47708	I	0	” “
47847	47848	47837	47837	he	105	” “
47888	47896	47897	47897	I	0	” Catherine was hurt by these insinuations . “
47902	47906	47897	47897	I	0	” said she , “
47921	47926	47917	47917	he	629	” Isabella recollected herself . “
48046	48047	48054	48054	Isabella	103	” “
48056	48061	48054	48054	Isabella	103	” said Mrs. Thorpe , “
48095	48312	48082	48082	everybody	1780	” Catherine ’s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen . She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella ’s regret ; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever , endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise . James soon followed his letter , and was received with the most gratifying kindness . CHAPTER 17 The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath ; and whether it should be the last was for some time a question , to which Catherine listened with a beating heart . To have her acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance . Her whole happiness seemed at stake , while the affair was in suspense , and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight . What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine ’s speculation . Once or twice indeed , since James ’s engagement had taught her what _ could _ be done , she had got so far as to indulge in a secret “
48315	48479	48082	48082	everybody	1780	” but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views : the present was now comprised in another three weeks , and her happiness being certain for that period , the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest . In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged , she visited Miss Tilney , and poured forth her joyful feelings . It was doomed to be a day of trial . No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow ! the past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment . Catherine ’s countenance fell , and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney ’s concluding words , “
48487	48488	48082	48082	everybody	1780	” “
48541	48542	48543	48543	I	0	” “
48550	48555	48543	48543	I	0	” said Catherine dejectedly ; “
48563	48564	48557	48557	I	0	” “
48567	48576	48543	48543	I	0	” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “
48591	48634	48577	48577	you	0	” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding . After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “
48654	48655	48640	48640	I	0	” “
48672	48673	48656	48656	I	0	” “
48697	48709	48691	48692	My daughter	1125	” he continued , without leaving his daughter time to speak , “
48949	49041	49042	49042	I	0	” Northanger Abbey ! these were thrilling words , and wound up Catherine ’s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy . Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness . To receive so flattering an invitation ! to have her company so warmly solicited ! everything honourable and soothing , every present enjoyment , and every future hope was contained in it ; and her acceptance , with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma ’s approbation , was eagerly given . “
49048	49052	49042	49042	I	0	” said she , “
49068	49095	49064	49064	they	1136	” General Tilney was not less sanguine , having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street , and obtained their sanction of his wishes . “
49105	49109	49064	49064	they	1136	” said he , “
49119	49917	49064	49064	they	1136	” Miss Tilney was earnest , though gentle , in her secondary civilities , and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would allow . The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine ’s feelings through the varieties of suspense , security , and disappointment ; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss ; and with spirits elated to rapture , with Henry at her heart , and Northanger Abbey on her lips , she hurried home to write her letter . Mr. and Mrs. Morland , relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their daughter , felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye , and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire . This indulgence , though not more than Catherine had hoped for , completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature , in friends and fortune , circumstance and chance . Everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage . By the kindness of her first friends , the Allens , she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her . Her feelings , her preferences , had each known the happiness of a return . Wherever she felt attachment , she had been able to create it . The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister . The Tilneys , they , by whom , above all , she desired to be favourably thought of , outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued . She was to be their chosen visitor , she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized — and , in addition to all the rest , this roof was to be the roof of an abbey ! her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney — and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill . To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one , or the cloisters of the other , had been for many weeks a darling wish , though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire . And yet , this was to happen . With all the chances against her of house , hall , place , park , court , and cottage , Northanger turned up an abbey , and she was to be its inhabitant . Its long , damp passages , its narrow cells and ruined chapel , were to be within her daily reach , and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends , some awful memorials of an injured and ill - fated nun . It was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home , that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne . The power of early habit only could account for it . A distinction to which they had been born gave no pride . Their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person . Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney ; but so active were her thoughts , that when these inquiries were answered , she was hardly more assured than before , of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation , of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution , of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed , or of its standing low in a valley , sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak . CHAPTER 18 With a mind thus full of happiness , Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away , without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together . She began first to be sensible of this , and to sigh for her conversation , as she walked along the pump - room one morning , by Mrs. Allen ’s side , without anything to say or to hear ; and scarcely had she felt a five minutes ’ longing of friendship , before the object of it appeared , and inviting her to a secret conference , led the way to a seat . “
49924	49949	49064	49064	they	1136	” said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors , which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either ; “
49958	50010	49064	49064	they	1136	” Catherine , observing that Isabella ’s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other , as in eager expectation , and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch , thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so ; and therefore gaily said , “
50024	50025	50018	50018	James	105	” “
50032	50036	50018	50018	James	105	” she replied , “
50114	50115	50116	50116	You	473	” “
50140	50141	50142	50142	I	0	” “
50209	50210	50195	50195	Tilney	92	” “
50226	50227	50217	50217	you	103	” “
50279	50280	50271	50271	John	99	” “

50334	50335	50313	50313	he	99	” “
50477	50524	50553	50553	his	99	” Catherine , with all the earnestness of truth , expressed her astonishment at such a charge , protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe ’s being in love with her , and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him . “
50653	50654	50643	50643	I	0	” “
50706	50707	50709	50709	you	473	” “
50931	50936	50928	50929	the person	894	” Isabella was silent . “
50973	50974	50964	50964	you	1162	” “
50978	50985	50964	50964	you	1162	” ( with a blush ) , “
51028	51029	51030	51030	I	0	” “
51047	51048	51030	51030	I	0	” “
51183	51184	51185	51185	You	1162	” “
51218	51219	51196	51196	wrong?—You	1162	” “
51226	51231	51196	51196	wrong?—You	1162	” answered Isabella laughingly , “
51338	51339	51356	51356	You	1162	” “
51363	51364	51356	51356	You	1162	” “
51369	51380	51381	51381	I	0	” continued the other without at all listening to her , “
51590	51648	51580	51580	he	92	” Catherine , looking up , perceived Captain Tilney ; and Isabella , earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke , soon caught his notice . He approached immediately , and took the seat to which her movements invited him . His first address made Catherine start . Though spoken low , she could distinguish , “
51662	51663	51580	51580	he	92	” “
51668	51679	51580	51580	he	92	” was Isabella ’s answer in the same half whisper . “
51706	51707	51708	51708	I	0	” “
51722	51723	51724	51724	My	0	” “
51747	51748	51738	51738	You	0	” “
51766	51767	51769	51769	they	1190	” “
51799	51808	51809	51809	I	0	” ( turning her back on him ) ; “
51818	51819	51809	51809	I	0	” “
51844	52844	52845	52845	My	0	” Catherine heard all this , and quite out of countenance , could listen no longer . Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking . But for this Isabella showed no inclination . She was so amazingly tired , and it was so odious to parade about the pump - room ; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters ; she was expecting her sisters every moment ; so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her , and must sit quietly down again . But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney . With much uneasiness did she thus leave them . It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement . To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible ; and yet , during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd . She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney . How strange that she should not perceive his admiration ! catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother . The compliment of John Thorpe ’s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister . She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious . In vanity , therefore , she gained but little ; her chief profit was in wonder . That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment . Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and would never be said again ; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort . CHAPTER 19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely . The result of her observations was not agreeable . Isabella seemed an altered creature . When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar ’s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed . A something of languid indifference , or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before , would occasionally come across her ; but had nothing worse appeared , _ that _ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest . But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over . What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at , was beyond her comprehension . Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent . James was the sufferer . She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object . For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned . Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment ; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it . He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension . She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her . If able to suggest a hint , Isabella could never understand it . In this distress , the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney ’s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own . But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing ; he was not to be of the party to Northanger ; he was to continue at Bath . When Catherine knew this , her resolution was directly made . She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement . “
52851	52857	52859	52859	he	419	” was Henry ’s answer . “
52868	52888	52892	52892	you	0	” He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “
52959	52965	52966	52966	I	0	” Henry smiled and said , “
52978	52979	52966	52966	I	0	” “
52989	52990	52981	52981	you	0	” “
53036	53037	53022	53022	He	419	” “
53049	53053	53054	53054	he	419	” cried Catherine ; “
53084	53085	53079	53079	he	419	” “
53097	53098	53088	53088	you	0	” “

53176	53186	53187	53187	Isabella	103	” Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , “
53251	53252	53253	53253	I	0	” “
53268	53269	53256	53256	she	103	” “

53323	53333	53314	53315	The gentlemen	260	” After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , “
53348	53349	53350	53350	I	0	” “
53359	53360	53350	53350	I	0	” “

53545	53546	53543	53543	her	901	” “
53549	53559	53561	53561	you	0	” said Catherine , after some moments ’ consideration , “
53619	53620	53621	53621	My	0	” “
53626	53630	53621	53621	My	0	” said Henry , “
53865	53878	53880	53880	Frederick	77	” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “
53958	54688	53943	53943	she	103	” Catherine would contend no longer against comfort . She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech , but it now carried her captive . Henry Tilney must know best . She blamed herself for the extent of her fears , and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again . Her resolution was supported by Isabella ’s behaviour in their parting interview . The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine ’s stay in Pulteney Street , and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness , or make her quit them in apprehension . James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid . Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry ’s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection . The embraces , tears , and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied . CHAPTER 20 Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend , whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion , and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased . Her happiness in going with Miss Tilney , however , prevented their wishing it otherwise ; and , as they were to remain only one more week in Bath themselves , her quitting them now would not long be felt . Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion , that , in the embarrassment of the first five minutes , she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney Street . Miss Tilney ’s manners and Henry ’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings ; but still she was far from being at ease ; nor could the incessant attentions of the General himself entirely reassure her . Nay , perverse as it seemed , she doubted whether she might not have felt less , had she been less attended to . His anxiety for her comfort — his continual solicitations that she would eat , and his often - expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste — though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast - table — made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor . She felt utterly unworthy of such respect , and knew not how to reply to it . Her tranquillity was not improved by the General ’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son , nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down . She was quite pained by the severity of his father ’s reproof , which seemed disproportionate to the offence ; and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture , and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her . This was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation , and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney , without being able to hope for his goodwill . He listened to his father in silence , and attempted not any defence , which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind , on Isabella ’s account , might , by keeping him long sleepless , have been the real cause of his rising late . It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “
54700	55174	55181	55181	he	1238	” The bustle of going was not pleasant . The clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down , and the General had fixed to be out of Milsom Street by that hour . His greatcoat , instead of being brought for him to put on directly , was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son . The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out , though there were three people to go in it , and his daughter ’s maid had so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit ; and , so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in , that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing - desk from being thrown out into the street . At last , however , the door was closed upon the three females , and they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome , highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles : such was the distance of Northanger from Bath , to be now divided into two equal stages . Catherine ’s spirits revived as they drove from the door ; for with Miss Tilney she felt no restraint ; and , with the interest of a road entirely new to her , of an abbey before , and a curricle behind , she caught the last view of Bath without any regret , and met with every milestone before she expected it . The tediousness of a two hours ’ wait at Petty France , in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry , and loiter about without anything to see , next followed — and her admiration of the style in which they travelled , of the fashionable chaise and four — postilions handsomely liveried , rising so regularly in their stirrups , and numerous outriders properly mounted , sunk a little under this consequent inconvenience . Had their party been perfectly agreeable , the delay would have been nothing ; but General Tilney , though so charming a man , seemed always a check upon his children ’s spirits , and scarcely anything was said but by himself ; the observation of which , with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded , and his angry impatience at the waiters , made Catherine grow every moment more in awe of him , and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four . At last , however , the order of release was given ; and much was Catherine then surprised by the General ’s proposal of her taking his place in his son ’s curricle for the rest of the journey : “
55195	55571	55181	55181	he	1238	” The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France . Half the time would have been enough for the curricle , and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move , that , had not the General chosen to have his own carriage lead the way , they could have passed it with ease in half a minute . But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses ; Henry drove so well — so quietly — without making any disturbance , without parading to her , or swearing at them : so different from the only gentleman - coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with ! and then his hat sat so well , and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat looked so becomingly important ! to be driven by him , next to being dancing with him , was certainly the greatest happiness in the world . In addition to every other delight , she had now that of listening to her own praise ; of being thanked at least , on his sister ’s account , for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor ; of hearing it ranked as real friendship , and described as creating real gratitude . His sister , he said , was uncomfortably circumstanced — she had no female companion — and , in the frequent absence of her father , was sometimes without any companion at all . “
55578	55582	55181	55181	he	1238	” said Catherine . “
55589	55590	55181	55181	he	1238	” “
55631	55632	55635	55635	you	1241	” “
55641	55642	55643	55643	I	0	” “
55651	55652	55649	55649	Eleanor	143	” “
55692	55699	55700	55700	You	143	” He smiled , and said , “

55735	55736	55717	55717	I	0	” “

56572	56573	56560	56560	I	0	” “
56873	56874	56982	56982	she	1284	” “
56891	56978	56979	56980	Miss Tilney	92	” But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther ; he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice , and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda ’s woes . Catherine , recollecting herself , grew ashamed of her eagerness , and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related . “
57006	58051	56999	56999	she	1284	” As they drew near the end of their journey , her impatience for a sight of the abbey — for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different — returned in full force , and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone , rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks , with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows . But so low did the building stand , that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger , without having discerned even an antique chimney . She knew not that she had any right to be surprised , but there was a something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected . To pass between lodges of a modern appearance , to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey , and driven so rapidly along a smooth , level road of fine gravel , without obstacle , alarm , or solemnity of any kind , struck her as odd and inconsistent . She was not long at leisure , however , for such considerations . A sudden scud of rain , driving full in her face , made it impossible for her to observe anything further , and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet ; and she was actually under the abbey walls , was springing , with Henry ’s assistance , from the carriage , was beneath the shelter of the old porch , and had even passed on to the hall , where her friend and the General were waiting to welcome her , without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself , or one moment ’s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice . The breeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her ; it had wafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain ; and having given a good shake to her habit , she was ready to be shown into the common drawing - room , and capable of considering where she was . An abbey ! yes , it was delightful to be really in an abbey ! but she doubted , as she looked round the room , whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness . The furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste . The fireplace , where she had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times , was contracted to a Rumford , with slabs of plain though handsome marble , and ornaments over it of the prettiest English china . The windows , to which she looked with peculiar dependence , from having heard the General talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care , were yet less what her fancy had portrayed . To be sure , the pointed arch was preserved — the form of them was Gothic — they might be even casements — but every pane was so large , so clear , so light ! to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions , and the heaviest stone - work , for painted glass , dirt , and cobwebs , the difference was very distressing . The General , perceiving how her eye was employed , began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture , where everything , being for daily use , pretended only to comfort , etc . ; flattering himself , however , that there were some apartments in the Abbey not unworthy her notice — and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular , when , taking out his watch , he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five ! this seemed the word of separation , and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss Tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at Northanger . Returning through the large and lofty hall , they ascended a broad staircase of shining oak , which , after many flights and many landing - places , brought them upon a long , wide gallery . On one side it had a range of doors , and it was lighted on the other by windows which Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle , before Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber , and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable , left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress . CHAPTER 21 A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of . It was by no means unreasonably large , and contained neither tapestry nor velvet . The walls were papered , the floor was carpeted ; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing - room below ; the furniture , though not of the latest fashion , was handsome and comfortable , and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful . Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay . Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste , and she was preparing to unpin the linen package , which the chaise - seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation , when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest , standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace . The sight of it made her start ; and , forgetting everything else , she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder , while these thoughts crossed her : “
58133	58676	58729	58729	I	0	” She advanced and examined it closely : it was of cedar , curiously inlaid with some darker wood , and raised , about a foot from the ground , on a carved stand of the same . The lock was silver , though tarnished from age ; at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver , broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence ; and , on the centre of the lid , was a mysterious cipher , in the same metal . Catherine bent over it intently , but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty . She could not , in whatever direction she took it , believe the last letter to be a _ T ; _ and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment . If not originally theirs , by what strange events could it have fallen into the Tilney family ? Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater ; and seizing , with trembling hands , the hasp of the lock , she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents . With difficulty , for something seemed to resist her efforts , she raised the lid a few inches ; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her , starting , quit her hold , and the lid closed with alarming violence . This ill - timed intruder was Miss Tilney ’s maid , sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland ; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her , it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing , and forced her , in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery , to proceed in her dressing without further delay . Her progress was not quick , for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm ; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt , she could not remain many paces from the chest . At length , however , having slipped one arm into her gown , her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged . One moment surely might be spared ; and , so desperate should be the exertion of her strength , that , unless secured by supernatural means , the lid in one moment should be thrown back . With this spirit she sprang forward , and her confidence did not deceive her . Her resolute effort threw back the lid , and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane , properly folded , reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession ! She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney , anxious for her friend ’s being ready , entered the room , and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation , was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search . “
58688	58705	58729	58729	I	0	” said Miss Tilney , as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass . “
58785	58873	59161	59161	she	1287	” Catherine had no leisure for speech , being at once blushing , tying her gown , and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch . Miss Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “
58883	59159	59161	59161	she	1287	” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace . The dining - parlour was a noble room , suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing - room than the one in common use , and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine , who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants . Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “
59177	59178	59161	59161	she	1287	” “
59183	59190	59161	59161	she	1287	” was Catherine ’s honest assurance ; “
59205	59625	59191	59192	Mr. Allen	85	” and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life . The General ’s good humour increased . Why , as he _ had _ such rooms , he thought it would be simple not to make use of them ; but , upon his honour , he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size . Mr. Allen ’s house , he was sure , must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness . The evening passed without any further disturbance , and , in the occasional absence of General Tilney , with much positive cheerfulness . It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them . The night was stormy ; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon ; and by the time the party broke up , it blew and rained violently . Catherine , as she crossed the hall , listened to the tempest with sensations of awe ; and , when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door , felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey . Yes , these were characteristic sounds ; they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes , which such buildings had witnessed , and such storms ushered in ; and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn ! _ She _ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants . Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning . In a house so furnished , and so guarded , she could have nothing to explore or to suffer , and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton . Thus wisely fortifying her mind , as she proceeded upstairs , she was enabled , especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her , to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart ; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire . “
59632	59641	59161	59161	she	1287	” said she , as she walked to the fender—“how
59751	59882	59883	59883	She	1296	” She looked round the room . The window curtains seemed in motion . It could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters ; and she stepped boldly forward , carelessly humming a tune , to assure herself of its being so , peeped courageously behind each curtain , saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her , and on placing a hand against the shutter , felt the strongest conviction of the wind ’s force . A glance at the old chest , as she turned away from this examination , was not without its use ; she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy , and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed . “
59941	60565	59911	59911	she	1296	” The fire therefore died away , and Catherine , having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements , was beginning to think of stepping into bed , when , on giving a parting glance round the room , she was struck by the appearance of a high , old - fashioned black cabinet , which , though in a situation conspicuous enough , had never caught her notice before . Henry ’s words , his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first , immediately rushed across her ; and though there could be nothing really in it , there was something whimsical , it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence ! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet . It was not absolutely ebony and gold ; but it was japan , black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind ; and as she held her candle , the yellow had very much the effect of gold . The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said . In short , she could not sleep till she had examined it . So , placing the candle with great caution on a chair , she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it ; but it resisted her utmost strength . Alarmed , but not discouraged , she tried it another way ; a bolt flew , and she believed herself successful ; but how strangely mysterious ! the door was still immovable . She paused a moment in breathless wonder . The wind roared down the chimney , the rain beat in torrents against the windows , and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation . To retire to bed , however , unsatisfied on such a point , would be vain , since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity . Again , therefore , she applied herself to the key , and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope ’s last effort , the door suddenly yielded to her hand : her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory , and having thrown open each folding door , the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock , though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual , a double range of small drawers appeared in view , with some larger drawers above and below them ; and in the centre , a small door , closed also with a lock and key , secured in all probability a cavity of importance . Catherine ’s heart beat quick , but her courage did not fail her . With a cheek flushed by hope , and an eye straining with curiosity , her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth . It was entirely empty . With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second , a third , a fourth ; each was equally empty . Not one was left unsearched , and in not one was anything found . Well read in the art of concealing a treasure , the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her , and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain . The place in the middle alone remained now unexplored ; and though she had “
60613	61622	62182	62183	Your sister	325	” It was some time however before she could unfasten the door , the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer ; but at length it did open ; and not vain , as hitherto , was her search ; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity , apparently for concealment , and her feelings at that moment were indescribable . Her heart fluttered , her knees trembled , and her cheeks grew pale . She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest . The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm ; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction ; it had yet some hours to burn ; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion , she hastily snuffed it . Alas ! it was snuffed and extinguished in one . A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect . Catherine , for a few moments , was motionless with horror . It was done completely ; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath . Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room . A violent gust of wind , rising with sudden fury , added fresh horror to the moment . Catherine trembled from head to foot . In the pause which succeeded , a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear . Human nature could support no more . A cold sweat stood on her forehead , the manuscript fell from her hand , and groping her way to the bed , she jumped hastily in , and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes . To close her eyes in sleep that night , she felt must be entirely out of the question . With a curiosity so justly awakened , and feelings in every way so agitated , repose must be absolutely impossible . The storm too abroad so dreadful ! she had not been used to feel alarm from wind , but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence . The manuscript so wonderfully found , so wonderfully accomplishing the morning ’s prediction , how was it to be accounted for ? What could it contain ? To whom could it relate ? By what means could it have been so long concealed ? And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it ! till she had made herself mistress of its contents , however , she could have neither repose nor comfort ; and with the sun ’s first rays she was determined to peruse it . But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene . She shuddered , tossed about in her bed , and envied every quiet sleeper . The storm still raged , and various were the noises , more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear . The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion , and at another the lock of her door was agitated , as if by the attempt of somebody to enter . Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery , and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans . Hour after hour passed away , and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep . CHAPTER 22 The housemaid ’s folding back her window - shutters at eight o’clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine ; and she opened her eyes , wondering that they could ever have been closed , on objects of cheerfulness ; her fire was already burning , and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night . Instantaneously , with the consciousness of existence , returned her recollection of the manuscript ; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid ’s going away , she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground , and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow . She now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books , for the roll , seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets , was altogether but of trifling size , and much less than she had supposed it to be at first . Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page . She started at its import . Could it be possible , or did not her senses play her false ? An inventory of linen , in coarse and modern characters , seemed all that was before her ! if the evidence of sight might be trusted , she held a washing - bill in her hand . She seized another sheet , and saw the same articles with little variation ; a third , a fourth , and a fifth presented nothing new . Shirts , stockings , cravats , and waistcoats faced her in each . Two others , penned by the same hand , marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting , in letters , hair - powder , shoe - string , and breeches - ball . And the larger sheet , which had enclosed the rest , seemed by its first cramp line , “
61626	62120	62182	62183	Your sister	325	mare”—a farrier ’s bill ! such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night ’s rest ! she felt humbled to the dust . Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ? A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her . Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies . To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable!—Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all ! How could she have so imposed on herself ? Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly ! and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it . This was the only comfort that occurred . Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly , those detestable papers then scattered over the bed , she rose directly , and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before , returned them to the same spot within the cabinet , with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again , to disgrace her even with herself . Why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable , for she could now manage them with perfect ease . In this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute , till the possibility of the door ’s having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener , darted into her head , and cost her another blush . She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before . Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest , with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited , was rather distressing . For the world would she not have her weakness suspected , and yet , unequal to an absolute falsehood , was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little . “
62130	62142	62122	62122	we	1300	” she added , desiring to get rid of the subject ; “
62167	62168	62158	62158	i	0	” “
62180	62181	62172	62172	you	0	” “
62233	62234	62193	62194	Mrs. Allen	88	” “
62338	62339	62381	62381	Mamma	138	” “
62388	62389	62381	62381	Mamma	138	” “
62442	62725	62434	62435	my sister	322	” Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the General , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind , but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure . The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine ’s notice when they were seated at table ; and , luckily , it had been the General ’s choice . He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste , confessed it to be neat and simple , thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country ; and for his part , to his uncritical palate , the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire , as from that of Dresden or Sêve . But this was quite an old set , purchased two years ago . The manufacture was much improved since that time ; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town , and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind , might have been tempted to order a new set . He trusted , however , that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one — though not for himself . Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him . Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston , where business required and would keep him two or three days . They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure . “
62738	62745	62434	62435	my sister	322	” observed the General to Eleanor . “
62757	62758	62434	62435	my sister	322	” “
62765	62769	62434	62435	my sister	322	” asked Catherine . “
63038	63170	63180	63180	he	1329	” The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes . The silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable . Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house , and he now offered himself as her conductor ; and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter , it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself , under any circumstances , not to be gladly accepted ; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey , and had seen only a few of its rooms . The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . “
63195	63201	63180	63180	he	1329	” She curtsied her acquiescence . “
63329	63388	63313	63313	He	1329	” He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney ’s saying , with a little confusion , “
63426	63866	63881	63881	he	1338	” Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood . Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed ? Could there be any unwillingness on the General ’s side to show her over the abbey ? The proposal was his own . And was not it odd that he should _ always _ take his walk so early ? Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so . It was certainly very provoking . She was all impatience to see the house , and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds . If Henry had been with them indeed ! But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it . Such were her thoughts , but she kept them to herself , and put on her bonnet in patient discontent . She was struck , however , beyond her expectation , by the grandeur of the abbey , as she saw it for the first time from the lawn . The whole building enclosed a large court ; and two sides of the quadrangle , rich in Gothic ornaments , stood forward for admiration . The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees , or luxuriant plantations , and the steep woody hills rising behind , to give it shelter , were beautiful even in the leafless month of March . Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it ; and her feelings of delight were so strong , that without waiting for any better authority , she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise . The General listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour . The kitchen - garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park . The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen ’s , as well as her father ’s , including church - yard and orchard . The walls seemed countless in number , endless in length ; a village of hot - houses seemed to arise among them , and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure . The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “
63990	63991	63975	63976	Mr. Allen	85	” “
64013	64055	63998	63999	Mr. Allen	85	” With a triumphant smile of self - satisfaction , the General wished he could do the same , for he never entered his , without being vexed in some way or other , by its falling short of his plan . “
64066	64078	64058	64059	Mr. Allen	85	” describing the nature of his own as they entered them . “
64113	64114	64115	64115	He	85	” “
64121	64209	64115	64115	He	85	” said the General , with a look of very happy contempt . Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired . “
64244	64245	64236	64236	Our	1353	” “
64255	64260	64236	64236	Our	1353	” said Miss Tilney , “
64279	64360	64377	64377	them	1357	” It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General ’s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward . He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition . He excused himself , however , from attending them : “
64382	64438	64439	64439	I	0	” He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “
64447	64456	64439	64439	I	0	” said her companion , with a sigh . “
64465	64507	64516	64516	her	607	” Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before , and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance , and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more . “
64518	64522	64508	64508	I	0	” added Eleanor ; “
64556	64557	64550	64550	her	607	” “
64563	64567	64550	64550	her	607	” reflected Catherine , “
64583	64594	64576	64577	the General	2216	” Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , “
64604	64605	64606	64610	A great and increasing one	1362	” “
64612	64622	64606	64610	A great and increasing one	1362	” replied the other , in a low voice . “
64664	64679	64680	64680	I	0	” She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “
64725	64726	64747	64748	A mother	885	” “
64737	64738	64739	64740	A mother	885	” “
64765	64766	64768	64768	she	885	” “
64804	64906	64791	64791	she	885	spirits?”—were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine ’s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not . Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded . The General certainly had been an unkind husband . He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ? And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “
64913	64924	64910	64910	I	0	” blushing at the consummate art of her own question , “
64932	64933	64907	64907	Her	885	” “
64998	65318	66959	66959	I	0	” Here was another proof . A portrait — very like — of a departed wife , not valued by the husband ! he must have been dreadfully cruel to her ! Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion . Yes , aversion ! his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her . She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary . She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled . Being no longer able , however , to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects , she soon began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house . He would follow them in a quarter of an hour . Again they parted — but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return . This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable . CHAPTER 23 An hour passed away before the General came in , spent , on the part of his young guest , in no very favourable consideration of his character . “
65342	66650	66959	66959	I	0	” At length he appeared ; and , whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations , he could still smile with _ them _ . Miss Tilney , understanding in part her friend ’s curiosity to see the house , soon revived the subject ; and her father being , contrary to Catherine ’s expectations , unprovided with any pretence for further delay , beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return , was at last ready to escort them . They set forward ; and , with a grandeur of air , a dignified step , which caught the eye , but could not shake the doubts of the well - read Catherine , he led the way across the hall , through the common drawing - room and one useless antechamber , into a room magnificent both in size and furniture — the real drawing - room , used only with company of consequence . It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General : the costliness or elegance of any room ’s fitting - up could be nothing to her ; she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century . When the General had satisfied his own curiosity , in a close examination of every well - known ornament , they proceeded into the library , an apartment , in its way , of equal magnificence , exhibiting a collection of books , on which an humble man might have looked with pride . Catherine heard , admired , and wondered with more genuine feeling than before — gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge , by running over the titles of half a shelf , and was ready to proceed . But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes . Large as was the building , she had already visited the greatest part ; though , on being told that , with the addition of the kitchen , the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court , she could scarcely believe it , or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted . It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats . From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present . The General ’s improving hand had not loitered here : every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this , their spacious theatre ; and , when the genius of others had failed , his own had often produced the perfection wanted . His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent . With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey ; the fourth side of the quadrangle having , on account of its decaying state , been removed by the General ’s father , and the present erected in its place . All that was venerable ceased here . The new building was not only new , but declared itself to be so ; intended only for offices , and enclosed behind by stable - yards , no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary . Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest , for the purposes of mere domestic economy ; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen , had the General allowed it ; but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on . They took a slight survey of all ; and Catherine was impressed , beyond her expectation , by their multiplicity and their convenience . The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton , were here carried on in appropriate divisions , commodious and roomy . The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices . Wherever they went , some pattened girl stopped to curtsy , or some footman in dishabille sneaked off . Yet this was an abbey ! how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about — from abbeys and castles , in which , though certainly larger than Northanger , all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost . How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . They returned to the hall , that the chief staircase might be ascended , and the beauty of its wood , and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out : having gained the top , they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay , and shortly entered one on the same plan , but superior in length and breadth . She was here shown successively into three large bed - chambers , with their dressing - rooms , most completely and handsomely fitted up ; everything that money and taste could do , to give comfort and elegance to apartments , had been bestowed on these ; and , being furnished within the last five years , they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing , and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine . As they were surveying the last , the General , after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured , turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine , and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be “
66656	66958	66959	66959	I	0	” She felt the unexpected compliment , and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself , and so full of civility to all her family . The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ? Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest . The General ’s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant . Something was certainly to be concealed ; her fancy , though it had trespassed lately once or twice , could not mislead her here ; and what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “
66980	67120	66959	66959	I	0	” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine . It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience . She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour . Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered . “
67130	67140	67127	67127	I	0	” said she , in a tone of feeling . “
67145	67146	67127	67127	I	0	” “
67159	67160	67161	67161	She	1383	” “
67169	67204	67161	67161	She	1383	” And nine years , Catherine knew , was a trifle of time , compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife , before her room was put to rights . “
67217	67218	67205	67205	You	0	” “
67221	67228	67205	67205	You	0	” said Miss Tilney , sighing ; “
67252	67408	67409	67410	My father	629	” Catherine ’s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words . Could it be possible ? Could Henry ’s father — ? And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions ! and , when she saw him in the evening , while she worked with her friend , slowly pacing the drawing - room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness , with downcast eyes and contracted brow , she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him . It was the air and attitude of a Montoni ! what could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity , in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt ? Unhappy man ! and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly , as to catch Miss Tilney ’s notice . “
67412	67416	67409	67410	My father	629	” she whispered , “
67431	67432	67409	67410	My father	629	” “
67438	67542	67543	67543	I	0	” thought Catherine ; such ill - timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks , and boded nothing good . After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell . When the butler would have lit his master ’s candle , however , he was forbidden . The latter was not going to retire . “
67550	67556	67543	67543	I	0	” said he to Catherine , “
67615	68989	68990	68990	Eleanor	143	” But neither the business alleged , nor the magnificent compliment , could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose . To be kept up for hours , after the family were in bed , by stupid pamphlets was not very likely . There must be some deeper cause : something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept ; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived , shut up for causes unknown , and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food , was the conclusion which necessarily followed . Shocking as was the idea , it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened , as , in the natural course of things , she must ere long be released . The suddenness of her reputed illness , the absence of her daughter , and probably of her other children , at the time — all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment . Its origin — jealousy perhaps , or wanton cruelty — was yet to be unravelled . In revolving these matters , while she undressed , it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman ’s confinement — might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days ; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division ? In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account . To what might not those doors lead ? In support of the plausibility of this conjecture , it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery , in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney , must be , as certainly as her memory could guide her , exactly over this suspected range of cells , and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse , communicating by some secret means with those cells , might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband . Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well - prepared insensibility ! Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises , and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far ; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible . The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General ’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up . Till midnight , she supposed it would be in vain to watch ; but then , when the clock had struck twelve , and all was quiet , she would , if not quite appalled by darkness , steal out and look once more . The clock struck twelve — and Catherine had been half an hour asleep . CHAPTER 24 The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments . It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the General in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine ’s curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o’clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp . The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney , which immediately fronted the family pew . By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained ; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph , in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband , who must have been in some way or other her destroyer , affected her even to tears . That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine . Not , however , that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced . She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice , going on from crime to crime , murdering whomsoever they chose , without any feeling of humanity or remorse ; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career . The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney ’s actual decease . Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber , were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed — what could it avail in such a case ? Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced , and a supposititious funeral carried on . The succeeding morning promised something better . The General ’s early walk , ill - timed as it was in every other view , was favourable here ; and when she knew him to be out of the house , she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise . Eleanor was ready to oblige her ; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise , their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed - chamber . It represented a very lovely woman , with a mild and pensive countenance , justifying , so far , the expectations of its new observer ; but they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry ’s , of Eleanor’s — the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child . A face once taken was taken for generations . But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness . She contemplated it , however , in spite of this drawback , with much emotion , and , but for a yet stronger interest , would have left it unwillingly . Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse ; she could only look at her companion . Eleanor ’s countenance was dejected , yet sedate ; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing . Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her ! the name of “
68991	69252	69253	69254	My father	629	” at the same moment , in his loudest tone , resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror . An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again . She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry General to attend him in his own apartment . No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors . The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present . And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , “
69263	70122	70123	70124	Mr. Tilney	95	” she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the General , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so . Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence , after the company left them , and nothing occurred to disturb it . In the course of this morning ’s reflections , she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone . It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter . To involve her in the danger of a second detection , to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart , could not be the office of a friend . The General ’s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter ; and , besides , she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion . It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions , from which the other had , in all likelihood , been hitherto happily exempt ; nor could she therefore , in _ her _ presence , search for those proofs of the General ’s cruelty , which however they might yet have escaped discovery , she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth , in the shape of some fragmented journal , continued to the last gasp . Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress ; and as she wished to get it over before Henry ’s return , who was expected on the morrow , there was no time to be lost . The day was bright , her courage high ; at four o’clock , the sun was now two hours above the horizon , and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual . It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike . It was no time for thought ; she hurried on , slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors , and without stopping to look or breathe , rushed forward to the one in question . The lock yielded to her hand , and , luckily , with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being . On tiptoe she entered ; the room was before her ; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step . She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature . She saw a large , well - proportioned apartment , an handsome dimity bed , arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid ’s care , a bright Bath stove , mahogany wardrobes , and neatly painted chairs , on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows ! Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were . Astonishment and doubt first seized them ; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame . She could not be mistaken as to the room ; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!—in Miss Tilney ’s meaning , in her own calculation ! this apartment , to which she had given a date so ancient , a position so awful , proved to be one end of what the General ’s father had built . There were two other doors in the chamber , leading probably into dressing - closets ; but she had no inclination to open either . Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked , or the volume in which she had last read , remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper ? No : whatever might have been the General ’s crimes , he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection . She was sick of exploring , and desired but to be safe in her own room , with her own heart only privy to its folly ; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered , when the sound of footsteps , she could hardly tell where , made her pause and tremble . To be found there , even by a servant , would be unpleasant ; but by the General ( and he seemed always at hand when least wanted ) , much worse ! she listened — the sound had ceased ; and resolving not to lose a moment , she passed through and closed the door . At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened ; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs , by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery . She had no power to move . With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view . “
70126	70143	70123	70124	Mr. Tilney	95	” she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment . He looked astonished too . “
70147	70157	70123	70124	Mr. Tilney	95	” she continued , not attending to his address . “
70170	70171	70165	70165	you	95	” “
70179	70186	70174	70174	I	0	” he replied , greatly surprised . “
70212	70251	70206	70206	I	0	” Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . She moved on towards the gallery . “
70261	70273	70254	70254	I	0	” said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , “
70311	70312	70313	70313	I	0	” “
70317	70324	70313	70313	I	0	” said Catherine , looking down , “

70510	70515	70488	70488	she	1410	” dropping her voice , “
70522	70523	70488	70488	she	1410	” “
70529	70537	70488	70488	she	1410	” said Henry , earnestly regarding her . “
70549	70550	70539	70539	you	0	” “
70571	70572	70565	70565	I	0	” “
70581	70586	70565	70565	I	0	” showing his watch ; “
70613	70657	70659	70659	you	0	” She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him . They walked slowly up the gallery . “
70670	70671	70659	70659	you	0	” “
70689	70690	70681	70681	Isabella	103	” “
70804	70805	70793	70793	She	607	” “
70808	70809	70793	70793	She	607	” “
70818	70839	70793	70793	She	607	” Catherine said nothing . After a short silence , during which he had closely observed her , he added , “
70949	70950	70936	70936	Eleanor	143	” “
70978	70990	70992	70992	you	1426	” ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , “
71017	71018	71005	71005	I	0	” “
71024	71036	71005	71005	I	0	” he replied ( his quick eye fixed on hers ) , “
71046	71050	71005	71005	I	0	some”—(involuntarily she shook her head)—“or
71061	71077	71078	71078	My	0	” She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before . “
71083	71087	71078	71078	My	0	” he continued , “
71275	71276	71278	71279	your father	821	” “
71281	71285	71278	71279	your father	821	” said Catherine , “
71292	71293	71278	71279	your father	821	” “
71399	71400	71401	71401	I	0	” “
71408	71412	71401	71401	I	0	” said Catherine ; “
71420	71421	71401	71401	I	0	” “
71582	72790	71578	71578	you	0	” They had reached the end of the gallery , and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room . CHAPTER 25 The visions of romance were over . Catherine was completely awakened . Henry ’s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done . Most grievously was she humbled . Most bitterly did she cry . It was not only with herself that she was sunk — but with Henry . Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever . The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father — could he ever forgive it ? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears — could they ever be forgotten ? She hated herself more than she could express . He had — she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her . But now — in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor ’s inquiry if she was well . The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual . Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it . The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness ; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity . She did not learn either to forget or defend the past ; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther , and that it might not cost her Henry ’s entire regard . Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done , nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary , self - created delusion , each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm , and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which , before she entered the abbey , had been craving to be frightened . She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger . She saw that the infatuation had been created , the mischief settled , long before her quitting Bath , and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged . Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe ’s works , and charming even as were the works of all her imitators , it was not in them perhaps that human nature , at least in the Midland counties of England , was to be looked for . Of the Alps and Pyrenees , with their pine forests and their vices , they might give a faithful delineation ; and Italy , Switzerland , and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented . Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities . But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved , in the laws of the land , and the manners of the age . Murder was not tolerated , servants were not slaves , and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured , like rhubarb , from every druggist . Among the Alps and Pyrenees , perhaps , there were no mixed characters . There , such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend . But in England it was not so ; among the English , she believed , in their hearts and habits , there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad . Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable . Her mind made up on these several points , and her resolution formed , of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense , she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever ; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day . Henry ’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said . There were still some subjects , indeed , under which she believed they must always tremble — the mention of a chest or a cabinet , for instance — and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape : but even _ she _ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly , however painful , might not be without use . The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance . Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater . She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James . Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella . James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton . But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it ! this made it so particularly strange ! For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry ’s willing hand . She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself . “
72799	72821	72795	72795	James	105	” as she looked at the direction . She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “
72825	73168	72822	72823	Dear Catherine	174	“ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me . I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again . I shall not enter into particulars — they would only pain you more . You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! i am undeceived in time ! but it is a heavy blow ! after my father ’s consent had been so kindly given — but no more of this . She has made me miserable forever ! let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon . I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced . Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much . I have written to him and my father . Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears . I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man . I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney . We parted at last by mutual consent — happy for me had we never met ! i can never expect to know such another woman ! Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart . “
73172	73571	72822	72823	Dear Catherine	174	” & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began . He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father ’s entrance . They went to breakfast directly ; but Catherine could hardly eat anything . Tears filled her eyes , and even ran down her cheeks as she sat . The letter was one moment in her hand , then in her lap , and then in her pocket ; and she looked as if she knew not what she did . The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible . As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room ; but the housemaids were busy in it , and she was obliged to come down again . She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her . She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour ’s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration . Perhaps , if particularly questioned , she might just give an idea — just distantly hint at it — but not more . To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her — and then their own brother so closely concerned in it ! She believed she must waive the subject altogether . Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously . Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “
73600	73601	73591	73591	I	0	” “
73607	73615	73606	73606	you	1446	” ( sighing as she spoke ) ; “
73631	73651	73626	73627	my brother	419	” Nothing further was said for a few minutes ; and then speaking through her tears , she added , “
73665	73666	73667	73667	I	0	” “
73671	73683	73667	73667	I	0	” said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; “
73705	73706	73695	73695	I	0	” “
73728	73729	73722	73722	you	1446	” “
73742	73747	73722	73722	you	1446	” replied Henry warmly , “
73758	73759	73722	73722	you	1446	” “
73767	73779	73790	73790	you	1446	” said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , “
73804	73805	73790	73790	you	1446	” “
73811	73812	73790	73790	you	1446	” “
73851	73888	73848	73849	Captain Tilney	77	” Eleanor ’s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe ’s name was included , passed his lips . “
73894	73898	73899	73899	you	1446	” cried Catherine : “
73973	73974	73975	73975	I	0	” “
74060	74061	74077	74077	Stay	177	” “
74084	74093	74077	74077	Stay	177	” recollecting with a blush the last line . “
74110	74111	74095	74095	you	1446	” “
74118	74128	74116	74116	yourself	1446	” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer . “
74138	74149	74134	74134	I	0	” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “
74159	74181	74150	74150	James	105	” He gladly received the letter , and , having read it through , with close attention , returned it saying , “
74237	74273	74222	74222	I	0	” Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune . “
74284	74290	74277	74282	a very good sort of woman	1471	” was Catherine ’s answer . “
74296	74297	74298	74299	A lawyer	1473	” “
74309	74310	74304	74304	They	1474	” “
74317	74318	74313	74315	a wealthy family	1475	” “
74374	74384	74351	74351	He	821	” The brother and sister looked at each other . “
74387	74396	74351	74351	He	821	” said Eleanor , after a short pause , “
74488	74489	74467	74467	Frederick	77	” “
74610	74611	74612	74618	Such a sister - in - law	1488	” “
74627	74634	74620	74620	Henry	95	” said Eleanor with a smile . “
74638	74642	74620	74620	Henry	95	” observed Catherine , “
74675	74676	74670	74670	she	1479	” “
74684	74688	74678	74678	I	0	” replied Henry ; “
74727	74728	74714	74714	I	0	” “
74797	74798	74773	74773	she	1479	” “
74811	74812	74813	74813	My	0	” “
74840	74841	74842	74842	Your	0	” “
74988	74989	74983	74983	You	0	” “
74992	75003	74983	74983	You	0	” said Catherine , after a few moments ’ reflection , “
75063	75064	75065	75065	You	0	” “
75096	75549	75091	75091	they	1503	” Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it . CHAPTER 26 From this time , the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people ; and Catherine found , with some surprise , that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella ’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother . Their persuasion that the General would , upon this ground alone , independent of the objection that might be raised against her character , oppose the connection , turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself . She was as insignificant , and perhaps as portionless , as Isabella ; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself , at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest ? The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money , which she had more than once heard him utter , and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children . They were so fully convinced , however , that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father ’s consent , and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time , that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own . But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations . She proposed it to him accordingly ; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected . “
75552	75556	75091	75091	they	1503	” said he , “
75584	75585	75577	75577	He	77	” “
75595	75596	75587	75587	he	77	” “
75603	75856	75587	75587	he	77	” A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney . His brother and sister knew not what to think . Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement , and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it . The General , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick ’s remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland ’s time at Northanger pass pleasantly . He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day ’s society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood . But then it was such a dead time of year , no wild - fowl , no game , and the Lady Frasers were not in the country . And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him . Henry was greatly honoured and very happy , and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme . “
75898	75899	75860	75860	you	1505	” “
76198	76259	76260	76260	I	0	” A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion , so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston ; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry , about an hour afterwards , came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting , and said , “
76367	76368	76354	76354	I	0	” “
76372	76382	76354	76354	I	0	” said Catherine , with a very long face . “
76386	76387	76354	76354	I	0	” “
76429	76430	76415	76415	I	0	” “
76436	76437	76415	76415	I	0	” “
76451	76452	76445	76445	I	0	” “
76489	76494	76495	76495	I	0	” Henry only smiled . “
76569	76570	76571	76571	I	0	” “
76604	77264	76597	76597	Eleanor	143	” He went ; and , it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry ’s , she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right , however disagreeable to her his going . But the inexplicability of the General ’s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts . That he was very particular in his eating , she had , by her own unassisted observation , already discovered ; but why he should say one thing so positively , and mean another all the while , was most unaccountable ! how were people , at that rate , to be understood ? Who but Henry could have been aware of what his father was at ? From Saturday to Wednesday , however , they were now to be without Henry . This was the sad finale of every reflection : and Captain Tilney ’s letter would certainly come in his absence ; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet . The past , present , and future were all equally in gloom . Her brother so unhappy , and her loss in Isabella so great ; and Eleanor ’s spirits always affected by Henry ’s absence ! what was there to interest or amuse her ? She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies — always so smooth and so dry ; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house . The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building . What a revolution in her ideas ! she , who had so longed to be in an abbey ! now , there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well - connected parsonage , something like Fullerton , but better : Fullerton had its faults , but Woodston probably had none . If Wednesday should ever come ! It did come , and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for . It came — it was fine — and Catherine trod on air . By ten o’clock , the chaise and four conveyed the trio from the abbey ; and , after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles , they entered Woodston , a large and populous village , in a situation not unpleasant . Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed . At the further end of the village , and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it , stood the parsonage , a new - built substantial stone house , with its semicircular sweep and green gates ; and , as they drove up to the door , Henry , with the friends of his solitude , a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers , was ready to receive and make much of them . Catherine ’s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting . Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him . “
77274	77278	77265	77265	We	1528	” said he . “
77393	77596	77602	77602	you	1533	” Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits . The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General . It was a prettily shaped room , the windows reaching to the ground , and the view from them pleasant , though only over green meadows ; and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it . “
77639	77640	77641	77641	I	0	” “
77644	77655	77641	77641	I	0	” said the General , with a most satisfied smile , “
77673	77674	77720	77720	you	1533	” “
77714	77715	77716	77716	You	1533	” “
77746	79089	77735	77735	Robinson	182	” Such a compliment recalled all Catherine ’s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her . The influence of fresh objects and fresh air , however , was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations ; and , having reached the ornamental part of the premises , consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow , on which Henry ’s genius had begun to act about half a year ago , she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure - ground she had ever been in before , though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner . A saunter into other meadows , and through part of the village , with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements , and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about , brought them to four o’clock , when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three . At four they were to dine , and at six to set off on their return . Never had any day passed so quickly ! She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the General ; nay , that he was even looking at the side - table for cold meat which was not there . His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind . They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it . CHAPTER 27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : _ Bath , April _ My dearest Catherine , I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner . I really am quite ashamed of my idleness ; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing . I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other . Pray write to me soon , and direct to my own home . Thank God , we leave this vile place to - morrow . Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone . I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive . I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding . Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it . The spring fashions are partly down ; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine . I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me . I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together . I rejoice to say that the young man whom , of all others , I particularly abhor , has left Bath . You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away . Afterwards he got worse , and became quite my shadow . Many girls might have been taken in , for never were such attentions ; but I knew the fickle sex too well . He went away to his regiment two days ago , and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again . He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable . The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis : I pitied his taste , but took no notice of him . The last time we met was in Bath Street , and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me ; I would not even look at him . He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world . Such a contrast between him and your brother ! pray send me some news of the latter — I am quite unhappy about him ; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away , with a cold , or something that affected his spirits . I would write to him myself , but have mislaid his direction ; and , as I hinted above , am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss . Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights . I have not been to the Rooms this age , nor to the play , except going in last night with the Hodges , for a frolic , at half price : they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone . We happened to sit by the Mitchells , and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out . I knew their spite : at one time they could not be civil to me , but now they are all friendship ; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them . You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own . Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take . I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter — it is your dear brother ’s favourite colour . Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine . Its inconsistencies , contradictions , and falsehood struck her from the very first . She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her . Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty , and her demands impudent . “
79111	79156	79172	79172	she	103	” On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation . When she had finished it—“So
79161	79165	79159	79159	Isabella	103	” she cried , “
79252	79253	79250	79250	her	103	” “
79264	79268	79260	79260	you	0	” said Henry . “
79333	79334	79335	79335	I	0	” “
79409	79410	79412	79412	you	0	” “
79423	79424	79425	79425	I	0	” “
79433	79434	79429	79429	he	77	” “
79447	79453	79429	79429	he	77	” Henry bowed his assent . “
79525	79526	79514	79514	he	77	” “
79565	79566	79588	79588	yours	0	” “
79579	79580	79588	79588	yours	0	” “
79635	80055	79588	79588	yours	0	” Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness . Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable . She resolved on not answering Isabella ’s letter , and tried to think no more of it . CHAPTER 28 Soon after this , the General found himself obliged to go to London for a week ; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland ’s company , and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence . His departure gave Catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain . The happiness with which their time now passed , every employment voluntary , every laugh indulged , every meal a scene of ease and good humour , walking where they liked and when they liked , their hours , pleasures , and fatigues at their own command , made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the General ’s presence had imposed , and most thankfully feel their present release from it . Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day ; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one , and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other , she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy ; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit ; before the General came home , the fourth week would be turned , and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer . This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred ; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind , she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once , propose going away , and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken . Aware that if she gave herself much time , she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject , she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor , and of Eleanor ’s being in the middle of a speech about something very different , to start forth her obligation of going away very soon . Eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned . She had “
80124	80128	80114	80114	they	1555	” Catherine explained : “
80160	80161	80154	80154	they	1555	” “
80178	80179	80183	80183	she	1552	” “
80190	80191	80183	80183	she	1552	” “
80215	80216	80210	80210	you	1557	” “
80240	80577	80231	80231	I	0	” And it was directly settled that , till she had , her leaving them was not even to be thought of . In having this cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed , the force of the other was likewise weakened . The kindness , the earnestness of Eleanor ’s manner in pressing her to stay , and Henry ’s gratified look on being told that her stay was determined , were such sweet proofs of her importance with them , as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without . She did — almost always — believe that Henry loved her , and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them ; and believing so far , her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations . Henry was not able to obey his father ’s injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies , during his absence in London , the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights . His loss was not now what it had been while the General was at home ; it lessened their gaiety , but did not ruin their comfort ; and the two girls agreeing in occupation , and improving in intimacy , found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves , that it was eleven o’clock , rather a late hour at the abbey , before they quitted the supper - room on the day of Henry ’s departure . They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed , as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge , that a carriage was driving up to the door , and the next moment confirmed the idea by the loud noise of the house - bell . After the first perturbation of surprise had passed away , in a “
80587	81027	81028	81028	My	0	” it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother , whose arrival was often as sudden , if not quite so unseasonable , and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him . Catherine walked on to her chamber , making up her mind as well as she could , to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney , and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her , and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her , that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful . She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe ; and indeed , as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted , there could be no danger of it ; and as long as all mention of Bath scenes were avoided , she thought she could behave to him very civilly . In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent . Scarcely , however , had she convicted her fancy of error , when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start ; it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway — and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it . She trembled a little at the idea of anyone ’s approaching so cautiously ; but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm , or misled by a raised imagination , she stepped quietly forward , and opened the door . Eleanor , and only Eleanor , stood there . Catherine ’s spirits , however , were tranquillized but for an instant , for Eleanor ’s cheeks were pale , and her manner greatly agitated . Though evidently intending to come in , it seemed an effort to enter the room , and a still greater to speak when there . Catherine , supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney ’s account , could only express her concern by silent attention , obliged her to be seated , rubbed her temples with lavender water , and hung over her with affectionate solicitude . “
81041	81049	81032	81032	you	76	” were Eleanor ’s first connected words . “
81075	81076	81066	81066	I	0	” “
81082	81083	81066	81066	I	0	” “
81098	81120	81094	81094	I	0	” A new idea now darted into Catherine ’s mind , and turning as pale as her friend , she exclaimed , “
81128	81129	81130	81130	You	76	” “
81136	81146	81130	81130	You	76	” returned Eleanor , looking at her most compassionately ; “
81160	81238	81158	81158	himself	629	” Her voice faltered , and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name . His unlooked - for return was enough in itself to make Catherine ’s heart sink , and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told . She said nothing ; and Eleanor , endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness , but with eyes still cast down , soon went on . “
81398	81399	81400	81400	My	0	” “
81404	81417	81400	81400	My	0	” cried Catherine , suppressing her feelings as well as she could , “
81502	81503	81488	81488	you	143	” “
81514	81515	81518	81518	you	143	” “
81523	81546	81518	81518	you	143	” Eleanor made no answer ; and Catherine ’s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting , she added , thinking aloud , “
81658	81659	81650	81650	I	0	” “
81741	81750	81751	81751	I	0	” Catherine sat down , breathless and speechless . “
81916	81917	81888	81888	you	76	” “
81924	81932	81888	81888	you	76	” said Catherine in a faltering voice . “
82035	82060	82061	82061	I	0	” It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all ; and it was only for Eleanor ’s sake that she attempted it . “
82065	82069	82061	82061	I	0	” said she , “
82134	82135	82136	82136	I	0	” “
82230	82231	82223	82223	your	76	” “
82280	82309	82310	82310	I	0	” Eleanor saw that she wished to be alone ; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation , now left her with , “
82318	83269	82310	82310	I	0	” Catherine ’s swelling heart needed relief . In Eleanor ’s presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears , but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents . Turned from the house , and in such a way ! without any reason that could justify , any apology that could atone for the abruptness , the rudeness , nay , the insolence of it . Henry at a distance — not able even to bid him farewell . Every hope , every expectation from him suspended , at least , and who could say how long ? Who could say when they might meet again ? And all this by such a man as General Tilney , so polite , so well bred , and heretofore so particularly fond of her ! it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous . From what it could arise , and where it would end , were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm . The manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil , hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience , or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling ; of two days , the earliest fixed on , and of that almost the earliest hour , as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning , that he might not be obliged even to see her . What could all this mean but an intentional affront ? By some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him . Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion , but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected , or , at least , not supposed to be connected with it . Heavily passed the night . Sleep , or repose that deserved the name of sleep , was out of the question . That room , in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival , was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers . Yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then — how mournfully superior in reality and substance ! her anxiety had foundation in fact , her fears in probability ; and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil , the solitude of her situation , the darkness of her chamber , the antiquity of the building , were felt and considered without the smallest emotion ; and though the wind was high , and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house , she heard it all as she lay awake , hour after hour , without curiosity or terror . Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done . Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared . What so natural , as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it ? And she only wanted to know how far , after what had passed , an apology might properly be received by her . But the knowledge would have been useless here ; it was not called for ; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial — Eleanor brought no message . Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk . When everything was done they left the room , Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well - known , cherished object , and went down to the breakfast - parlour , where breakfast was prepared . She tried to eat , as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable ; but she had no appetite , and could not swallow many mouthfuls . The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery , and strengthened her distaste for everything before her . It was not four and twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast , but in circumstances how different ! with what cheerful ease , what happy , though false , security , had she then looked around her , enjoying everything present , and fearing little in future , beyond Henry ’s going to Woodston for a day ! happy , happy breakfast ! for Henry had been there ; Henry had sat by her and helped her . These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion , who sat as deep in thought as herself ; and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment . Catherine ’s colour rose at the sight of it ; and the indignity with which she was treated , striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force , made her for a short time sensible only of resentment . Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech . “
83280	83284	83285	83285	you	1596	” she cried ; “
83398	83399	83402	83402	Eleanor	143	” “
83436	83441	83442	83442	I	0	” Eleanor only replied , “
83474	83502	83456	83456	I	0	” But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine ’s pride in a moment , and she instantly said , “
83516	83748	83749	83749	her	1601	” There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle , though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of . It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case . Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment , but , upon examining her purse , was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend , she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home ; and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both , scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together . Short , however , was that time . The carriage was soon announced to be ready ; and Catherine , instantly rising , a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu ; and , as they entered the hall , unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either , she paused a moment , and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left “
83757	85588	83749	83749	her	1601	” But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings ; and , hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief , she darted across the hall , jumped into the chaise , and in a moment was driven from the door . CHAPTER 29 Catherine was too wretched to be fearful . The journey in itself had no terrors for her ; and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness . Leaning back in one corner of the carriage , in a violent burst of tears , she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head ; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it . Unfortunately , the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston ; and , for fourteen miles , every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different . Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive . The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life . It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage . Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard — had he even confused her by his too significant reference ! and now — what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ? The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge . Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each . Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her . If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation . If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house . But a justification so full of torture to herself , she trusted , would not be in his power . Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point , it was not , however , the one on which she dwelt most . There was a thought yet nearer , a more prevailing , more impetuous concern . How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment . To the General , of course , he would not dare to speak ; but to Eleanor — what might he not say to Eleanor about her ? In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries , on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose , the hours passed away , and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for . The pressing anxieties of thought , which prevented her from noticing anything before her , when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston , saved her at the same time from watching her progress ; and though no object on the road could engage a moment ’s attention , she found no stage of it tedious . From this , she was preserved too by another cause , by feeling no eagerness for her journey ’s conclusion ; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best , even after an absence such as hers — an eleven weeks ’ absence . What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family , that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it , extend an useless resentment , and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will ? She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor ’s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father ’s account , it would cut her to the heart . With these feelings , she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well - known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home . Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger ; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post - masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it ; so great had been her ignorance of her route . She met with nothing , however , to distress or frighten her . Her youth , civil manners , and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require ; and stopping only to change horses , she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm , and between six and seven o’clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton . A heroine returning , at the close of her career , to her native village , in all the triumph of recovered reputation , and all the dignity of a countess , with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons , and three waiting - maids in a travelling chaise and four , behind her , is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell ; it gives credit to every conclusion , and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows . But my affair is widely different ; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace ; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness . A heroine in a hack post - chaise is such a blow upon sentiment , as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand . Swiftly therefore shall her post - boy drive through the village , amid the gaze of Sunday groups , and speedy shall be her descent from it . But , whatever might be the distress of Catherine ’s mind , as she thus advanced towards the parsonage , and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it , she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went ; first , in the appearance of her carriage — and secondly , in herself . The chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton , the whole family were immediately at the window ; and to have it stop at the sweep - gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy — a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children , a boy and girl of six and four years old , who expected a brother or sister in every carriage . Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine ! happy the voice that proclaimed the discovery ! but whether such happiness were the lawful property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood . Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine ’s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible . So surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy ! in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her . Reluctantly , and with much hesitation , did she then begin what might perhaps , at the end of half an hour , be termed , by the courtesy of her hearers , an explanation ; but scarcely , within that time , could they at all discover the cause , or collect the particulars , of her sudden return . They were far from being an irritable race ; far from any quickness in catching , or bitterness in resenting , affronts : but here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter ’s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as a gentleman nor as a parent . Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “
85605	85633	85597	85597	he	1603	” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour . “
85647	85654	85637	85637	you	253	” said her mother at last ; “
85668	85669	85670	85670	I	0	” “
85685	85689	85637	85637	you	253	” said Sarah , “
85697	85698	85699	85699	I	0	” “
85707	85712	85699	85699	I	0	” returned Mrs. Morland ; “
85750	85754	85747	85748	General Tilney	139	” Catherine sighed . “
85757	85763	85747	85748	General Tilney	139	” continued her philosophic mother , “
85870	86267	86301	86302	Mrs. Allen	88	” Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother ’s next counsel of going early to bed . Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings , and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey , parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away ; and though , when they all met the next morning , her recovery was not equal to their hopes , they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil . They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough ! As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure . The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney . To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment — a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of — and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety . The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks , and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart . “
86275	86286	86301	86302	Mrs. Allen	88	” observed Mrs. Morland , as the letter was finished ; “
86352	86360	86344	86344	I	0	” Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , “
86371	86372	86369	86369	Eleanor	143	” “
86424	86585	86586	86586	We	1620	” Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation . The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine ’s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her . She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet — ! her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment . “
86592	86596	86586	86586	We	1620	” said she ; “
86698	86905	86906	86906	Catherine	76	” This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to ; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance , and made her reply less rational ; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well - known road . It was not three months ago since , wild with joyful expectation , she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day , with an heart light , gay , and independent ; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed , and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it . Three months ago had seen her all this ; and now , how altered a being did she return ! She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated — though Mrs. Morland ’s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions . “
86915	86919	86906	86906	Catherine	76	” said she . “
87020	87076	87099	87100	the General	2216	” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself . His wonder , his conjectures , and his explanations became in succession hers , with the addition of this single remark—“I
87083	87092	87093	87093	I	0	General”—to fill up every accidental pause . And , “
87102	87148	87099	87100	the General	2216	” was uttered twice after Mr. Allen left the room , without any relaxation of anger , or any material digression of thought . A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , “
87246	87247	87237	87237	you	253	” “
87259	87280	87237	87237	you	253	” said Catherine , her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there . “
87347	87348	87342	87342	you	253	” “
87356	87357	87350	87350	I	0	” “
87413	87433	87443	87447	an agreeable , worthy man	1641	” Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I
87498	87879	87880	87880	My	0	” As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends . There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine ’s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced . It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford . CHAPTER 30 Catherine ’s disposition was not naturally sedentary , nor had her habits been ever very industrious ; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort , her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased . She could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together , walking round the garden and orchard again and again , as if nothing but motion was voluntary ; and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour . Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration . In her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself ; but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had been before . For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint ; but when a third night ’s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness , improved her in useful activity , nor given her a greater inclination for needlework , she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of , “
87963	87979	87980	87980	her	1647	” Catherine took up her work directly , saying , in a dejected voice , that “
87990	87991	87980	87980	her	1647	” “
88026	88030	88019	88019	You	76	” After a short silence—“I
88112	88113	88114	88114	I	0	” “
88136	88137	88172	88172	I	0	” “
88197	88436	88175	88175	I	0	” Catherine said no more , and , with an endeavour to do right , applied to her work ; but , after a few minutes , sunk again , without knowing it herself , into languor and listlessness , moving herself in her chair , from the irritation of weariness , much oftener than she moved her needle . Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse ; and seeing , in her daughter ’s absent and dissatisfied look , the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness , hastily left the room to fetch the book in question , anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady . It was some time before she could find what she looked for ; and other family matters occurring to detain her , a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped . Her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself , she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes , till , on entering the room , the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before . With a look of much respect , he immediately rose , and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as “
88441	88898	88175	88175	I	0	” with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there , acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton , and stating his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland ’s having reached her home in safety , as the cause of his intrusion . He did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart . Far from comprehending him or his sister in their father ’s misconduct , Mrs. Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each , and instantly , pleased by his appearance , received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence ; thanking him for such an attention to her daughter , assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there , and entreating him to say not another word of the past . He was not ill - inclined to obey this request , for , though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked - for mildness , it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose . Returning in silence to his seat , therefore , he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland ’s common remarks about the weather and roads . Catherine meanwhile — the anxious , agitated , happy , feverish Catherine — said not a word ; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good - natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time , and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour . Desirous of Mr. Morland ’s assistance , as well in giving encouragement , as in finding conversation for her guest , whose embarrassment on his father ’s account she earnestly pitied , Mrs. Morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him ; but Mr. Morland was from home — and being thus without any support , at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say . After a couple of minutes ’ unbroken silence , Henry , turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother ’s entrance , asked her , with sudden alacrity , if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton ? And on developing , from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply , the meaning , which one short syllable would have given , immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them , and , with a rising colour , asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way . “
88910	91090	88899	88899	You	1654	” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him . They began their walk , and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it . Some explanation on his father ’s account he had to give ; but his first purpose was to explain himself , and before they reached Mr. Allen ’s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often . She was assured of his affection ; and that heart in return was solicited , which , perhaps , they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own ; for , though Henry was now sincerely attached to her , though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society , I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude , or , in other words , that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought . It is a new circumstance in romance , I acknowledge , and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine ’s dignity ; but if it be as new in common life , the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own . A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application . On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more . Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand . The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight . The General had had nothing to accuse her of , nothing to lay to her charge , but her being the involuntary , unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon , and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own . She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be . Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims , he had courted her acquaintance in Bath , solicited her company at Northanger , and designed her for his daughter - in - law . On discovering his error , to turn her from the house seemed the best , though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself , and his contempt of her family . John Thorpe had first misled him . The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name . Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them . With whomsoever he was , or was likely to be connected , his own consequence always required that theirs should be great , and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew , so regularly grew their fortune . The expectations of his friend Morland , therefore , from the first overrated , had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light . For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate . Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter ; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed . Upon such intelligence the General had proceeded ; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority . Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness . His resolution was soon formed . Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes . Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this , than his own children . Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error . The Allens , he believed , had lived near them too long , and he knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve . The General needed no more . Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself , he set out the next day for the abbey , where his performances have been seen . I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James . I have united for their ease what they must divide for mine . Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty . Henry , in having such things to relate of his father , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself . He blushed for the narrow - minded counsel which he was obliged to expose . The conversation between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind . Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold . The General , accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family , prepared for no reluctance but of feeling , no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words , could ill brook the opposition of his son , steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it . But , in such a cause , his anger , though it must shock , could not intimidate Henry , who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice . He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland , and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain , no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent , no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger , could shake his fidelity , or influence the resolutions it prompted . He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand . The General was furious in his anger , and they parted in dreadful disagreement . Henry , in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose , had returned almost instantly to Woodston , and , on the afternoon of the following day , had begun his journey to Fullerton . CHAPTER 31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start . His pleasing manners and good sense were self - evident recommendations ; and having never heard evil of him , it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told . Goodwill supplying the place of experience , his character needed no attestation . “
91104	91652	91094	91099	a sad , heedless young housekeeper	1657	” was her mother ’s foreboding remark ; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice . There was but one obstacle , in short , to be mentioned ; but till that one was removed , it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement . Their tempers were mild , but their principles were steady , and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained — and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied — their willing approbation was instantly to follow . His _ consent _ was all that they wished for . They were no more inclined than entitled to demand his _ money _ . Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter . The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this . They felt and they deplored — but they could not resent it ; and they parted , endeavouring to hope that such a change in the General , as each believed almost impossible , might speedily take place , to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection . Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry . Whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence , let us not inquire . Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way . The anxiety , which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine , and of all who loved either , as to its final event , can hardly extend , I fear , to the bosom of my readers , who will see in the tell - tale compression of the pages before them , that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity . The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt : what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the General ’s ? The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “
91662	91818	91819	91819	Your	1660	” The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry ’s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance . My own joy on the occasion is very sincere . I know no one more entitled , by unpretending merit , or better prepared by habitual suffering , to receive and enjoy felicity . Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her . His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “
